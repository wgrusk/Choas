Once again. Why was Kanye invited to the White House? Please dont say he was there representing all black people. When white people meet with the President do they represent all white people? I dont think so. Blacks are not  foreigners from another country seeking favours from an American President.",

The discomfort in the panelists is apparent as they underplay the realities of this sad event. The clips of West were cherry-picked and don't reveal what was really said, which was disturbing. Fox has gone too far across all its programming involving this - this was a person who is not well, and rambled on incoherently about subjects he has little knowledge of, and, in the sanctity of the Oval Office used the word MF for the world to hear - first time in histoy, and no one corrected the disrepect. This was POTUS exploiting a celebrity irrespective of the consequences, and what does Fox do - they treat like a victory for POTUS. Sad indeed -",

    "commentText": "Kanye's Points: \n- A lot of people believe that if you are black you MUST be democrat. \n- Welfare is the reason why a lot of black people are democrats. They were made to believe that, the more kids they had, the more they would be taken care of by the government. \n- Not a lot of male energy in the home, no father figure.  \n- Bring manufacturing/jobs back to America. \n- Mental health is a problem. \n- 13th amendment = trap door (I'm not really understanding this part.) \n- Misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder, wasn't bipolar, it was sleep deprivation that caused him to have dementia. \n- If the President doesn't look good, we don't look good. \n- Our (America's) best export is entertainment and ideas. \n- When people don't own land they want brands. When you don't spend your money investing, you waste it on brands to make it look like you have it together.\n- Black on black crime is far more than police killing blacks. This does not mean police are free of fault, but we need to look at both side of the coin. \n- Liberal brings race into everything, they live in a victimhood world. Racism is an invisible wall (imaginary wall to be better put). That ideology causes people to have limiting beliefs, in reality anyone can be successful in America, Kanye is walking proof of that. \n- Opening up industries, we need tax breaks to bring more businesses here. it costs too much to manufacture things here, that's why we export those jobs to China and Vietnam.\n- Mental health and arts program need to be brought into schools, so that kids aren't bored in school. Kids should be inspired. \n- Illegal guns is the problem, not legal guns, we have the right to bear arms.   \n- We should bend a bit on both sides (of the political spectrum), and be malleable to work together towards something that will benefit the American people.  \n\nI see nothing wrong with the way this man thinks, why do people believe that he's crazy? Why do they think that he's out of touch with reality? When the reality is that they've been perfectly groomed by the system and mob mentality that they are unable to see the truth.",

I cannot turn my head. I cannot blindly follow. I am an educated woman who cringes when I see the UN laughing at him, when I hear his barely coherent speeches. Many of his own cabinet have stated he is a moron, before the Republican congress decided that their own political aspirations, power and perks made them his toadies most of them publicly and privately called him a moron. My party has been hijacked by hate, anger, suspicion and stupidity. Where do I go from here? I'm not a Democrat, never will be, but how do I support this party and sleep at night?",

Also Trump is married to a woman, he loves women, he's not a sexist. The fact that these people are around Trump means he's not racist, it doesn't matter what he said or did in the past. He's not racist, even though he didn't allow black people to rent in his building in the 70's.",

This, unfortunately proves that MOST Whites are inherently racist and bigots and even the well-meaning Whites are basically no better than the Klan. To say what Kanye did today was too late and had no effect is very foolish and stupid.\n\nYeah, Kanye has an eclectic way of expressing himself, but many Blacks understand this and can interpret what he means and were touched by his love for the president.  Here's a suggestion...unless you can truly understand what it means to be Black and have walked in our shoes, STFU trying to tell us, or anyone else what \"impact\" Kanye or anyone else has on our community. This is the problem with Whites of both the DemonKKKrats and the Republicans. Just STFU and watch what happens. You don't know or understand sh*t about us, so STFU!",

But the black community turn their back on omarosa , Kanye , and candance owens . This isn't going to help you get black voters .... once you have kkk, white nationalist , nazie , alt right as REGISTER republican and your saying ppl who are nazies are as bad as ppl fighting nazies, it's hard for minorities to go to the Republican Party especially when the party is trying to cut medicad , disability , social secruity , food stamps , nutrition , housing and education while giving tax cuts to the rich .....no rational person is going to vote for that",
