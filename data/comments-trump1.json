Sexism is lack of belief in meritocracy and judging based on the sex of a person instead of her merits and capabilities.  It includes any sort of discrimination against women based on their gender, stereotyping all women and considering femininity inferior to masculinity. It is not sexism to call an individual woman ugly , fat or stupid but It would be sexist to say ' all women are stupid' or 'women can't do this or that'.",

    "commentText": "Women often get offended when Donald Trump says something offensive to someone who happens to be a female. You want to know WHY? It's because women are generally wired that way, by nature. Women are more group oriented, social creatures. They are more emotional on a personal level. They are more of a \"pack animal\" than are men. Proof? If you say an offensive thing to a man will most men come to his rescue? Of course not. Will most men be offended? Of course not. Will most men feel they must have revenge on someone giving offense to another man? Of course not. Men are not wired that way. But what about women? Women do the opposite of men. Women are definitely offended when something unpleasant is said by a man, to another woman. They all come to each others aid and defense. They all want revenge when a woman is offended. That's the way women are wired. And they take all this, so much for granted, they don't even see the gender differences, and how huge they truly are. And that's why all this \"equality\" bullshit, is just that. Women don't want equality. They want to be treated better than men are treated. They all want to be Princesses. They all want to be Queens. They all want to be put on a Pedestal. \n\nEquality? That would be a step down for them.\n\nBut think about what this means for politics. The cultural rule is, if a woman is running for politics, like Hillary, you are supposed to \"be nice\" to her, because she has a vagina. Don't be mean to her. Don't bring up all the nasty horrible things she has done. Don't \"go negative\" with the truth of what she is like, and don't bring up all the horrible character flaws in that woman. Treat her, like all women, like a Queen, like a Princess.\n\nFuck that. As a man I want women to be equal. I don't go around kissing every man's ass. I'm not \"nice\" to all the men. This applies especially to men who are my direct competitors for power and prestige. Why should I kiss their asses? I don't. Yet we are supposed to kiss Hillary's ass? She can attain the highest, most powerful office in the world, order men around all day, send men off to die in war, but we still have to kiss her ass, because she has a wrinkly old vagina? \n\nFuck that. As a man I find that offensive. I find the rule that you have to kiss all women's asses, extremely offensive. I find that rule is basically saying that I as a man, am a second class citizen. How do I justify that? Well, you can tell WHO has power, by WHO you cannot mock. You can tell WHO has power, by WHOSE ASS YOU HAVE TO KISS.\n\nAnd on CNN and all the mainstream media, the absolute rule is, you as a man must kiss every woman's ass. Don't take my word for it, think about it the next time you watch the news.\n\nI'm tired of kissing women's asses. I already have a wife who I treat very nice, and that's fine in a marriage. I treat my wife well, my daughter well......but now I have to kiss the ass of every woman in the world? And now every woman in the world has a special power, over every man, so that every man has to kiss the ass of every woman in the world? That's going way too far. That's the new cultural rule, and it will never work if we expect the genders to be equal. Treating women better than men just relegates men to being a lower class of human beings.\n\nNow I know where Political Correctness comes from: women's innate sensitivity, their social sense, their sense of group selection of favoring all women heavily over all men. All women put all other woman ahead of all men. That's been a painful lesson for me to learn in life, but it's the truth. Women consider me a  second class citizen. All these things, in this modern age brought us the nightmare of political correctness, where free speech is curtailed. You can't have free speech if you are constantly worried about giving offense to half the population. Of course the people pushing this kiss women's ass agenda the hardest are the Feminists, who definitely don't believe in free speech. More than anyone, they want to bully men into compliance and obedience. They want to dominate men and make them second class citizens. \n\nFeminism has pushed women to the front of men. As a group, far more women than men graduate from high school and university. For women under 35, they earn more as a group, than do men. And on top of all that, we men have to kiss the ass of the dominant group in society.....women? Fuck that.\n\nWake up and smell the coffee....Men are now Second Class Americans.",

I'm not trying to be sexist, it's just how it is. Women are naturally more flexible, understand emotions better, have a better memory, can raise a family easier, and intellectually outperform men at a young age. This doesn't make any single gender superior, it's just food for thought to all the people who believe male and female are equal. Females outclass males in some categories, as do males to females.",

They never talk about his points on only wanting legals in the country. You have to choose. Do you want a billionaire who can help this country's debt due to being a successful business man and maybe deport many illegals in this country, or you can vote for Hilary who broke a few laws and then destroyed the evidence. Hilary has been proven to lie a lot. It is your choice. Trump, a man who can help the debt and illegal problem or you can vote for Hillary, a liar and a criminal. You want a lying leader?",

    "commentText": "The reason why trump will be different from most president, and actually make change is because he doesn't need lobbyist or outside help to run. He owns a billion dollar company he has all the money to run, and this time you can see that he is actually trying, and he doesn't have to lie to the people because he doesn't need to do anything for any big business since he IS big business luckily he's also a patriot. Will trump change America for the better that's the real question, because the way it's headed now you better hope he will change it for the better. My opinion is out of all the candidates the only 2 I'd vote for is Bernie Sanders, and Donald Trump, because those two are the only one that I believe that have good policies and will be good for the economy. Which lets be fair the most of you only care for a bigger pay check and cheaper gas.  #Berniesanders2015  #Trump2015 #Hilaryforprison2015",

MSNBC is a left leaning opinion channel, and they are open & honest about it, but they are also scrupulous fact checkers.

Commercial real estate is a rough world, and sexist—and I’ve brought women into that business. ‘The Apprentice’ is entertainment, and a bit of outlandishness helps ratings—as everyone at Fox News knows.\n\n“But ‘war on women’? I’m surprised you’d invoke the Democrats’ talking point. They apply that description to anyone who questions their extreme views on the life issues. If you don’t blindly follow their absolutist view that any abortion, for any reason, in any trimester is perfectly fine, you are somehow anti-woman. Hillary Clinton seems satisfied that the number of abortions in this country has decreased slightly. It’s still 1 million a year. Planned Parenthood is trafficking in the body parts of those babies. More than half of the unborn children aborted in this country are girls. If allowed to live, they’d grow up to be women. That’s the real ‘war on women,’ and Democrats are leading it, Megyn.”",

Him not being a career politician, is probably the only candidate that has the courage and means to bring about true changes in the health care industry by bypassing all the lobbies and bureaucrats. \n \nThose of us working in the healthcare industry know that healthcare in this country in on the verge of collapse. Our citizens are getting third word level of care only with a first world façade. Healthcare in this country has become a theatre. We need a true leader with courage and open mind who can take bold steps to change it for better.\n \nI would like Mr. Trump bring this issue to the forefront, just like many other issues he did. I believe he is probably the only one among all the other current candidates who has the courage, blunt honesty and expertise to bring about real changes in the health care industry this country so desperately needs. I am not very hopeful with all the other candidates in this issue, because, they have all held some sort of offices, had a chance to bring this issue to the forefront, but did not. All politicians are focused on upholding or defeating Obama care which mostly deals with the insurance issue, but no one is talking about what can they do with it. Obama care failed to address access to care, level of care, quality of care and the number of its providers. \n \nI applaud Mr.Trump's vision to make this country great again, but it won't be so great if its citizens are not in great states of health.\n                                                                                                                                  A Concerned Physician.",

However, one thing I do actually agree with him on is that a we've come so far in terms of equality, yet we've stepped backwards with political correctness. Everybody nit-picks at every little thing that anybody says, and no one is allowed to say anything without people jumping up and saying 'ohh that's offensive to women, that's offensive to gay people, that's racist, that's offensive to people with mental health, that's sexist, you can't say this word anymore because it generalises people, blah blah blah'.\n\nWhat he said was rather malicious towards women, even if it was meant light-heartedly. And I think there's a line you have to draw when people like him and Katie Hopkins are just being plain nasty about people for no reason. However, I don't think there's any harm in agree giving an honest opinion or making an innocent bantery joke that might be steered towards any kind of incline that might offend anyone, as long as there's no malice there. \n\nI think if you're offended, deal with it.",

    "commentText": "To answer the question of this video; the answer is no because Donald Trump is an equal opportunity offender.  What is happening here is that Facebook is now financially supporting FOX and everyone knows that Mark Zuckerberg kicked off tech lobbying over two years ago.  His agenda, in particular is to push for a significant increase in legal immigration.  How you stand on that or the forming of FWD.us isn't really the point.  It's whether or not you trust what he claims is his agenda.\n\nAlso, cable news anchors no longer exist.  They're corporate representatives that push for lobbyist interests.  Did anyone notice that big \"F\" corporate logo prominently displayed behind the republican candidates?\n\nThe republican debate wasn't even a debate and while we're at it, why hasn't there been a democratic debate yet?  Because you can't have a debate without Hillary Clinton and she's covered in so much mud right now that she has every reason to avoid cameras, let alone a proper debate, if one could actually occur, for as long as it takes for her to come up with a bullshit excuse for every controversy surrounding her. \n\nMegyn's question was a cheap and old and reliable tactic that the Democrats have been using a decades.  The truth is that if Trump doesn't like you, he shows it and if you've been checking the most recent polls, this attempt and smearing his character has had no affect.  He's still leading the Republican race.  Maybe that's because he's the only honest politician running; and let's face it, for better or for worse, he wears his heart on his sleeve and refuses to play political games.  He's a Washington outsider, which is an obvious statement on my part.\n\nAs for Megyn Kelly, her job is to sell, not to report or moderate.  That's what a fake is and for that, you just can't take her or any cable news station's questions seriously.",

Didn't people hear his responses to questions? All he did is attack the questioner & resort to name calling. He didn't say anything of any substance.\nExample, the question: \"what proof do you have that the Mexican government  is sending criminals to the U.S.\" answer: \"The United States politicians are stupid, they are stupid. The Mexican politicians are smarter they are more cunning, they don't want to pay for their criminals... \" people call that an answer? It was a lame answer, very poor. \nHe knows how to promote himself & stir things up to get ratings. \nI'm hoping that once ppl see more of him they will see that he is very egotistical & he doesn't answer the questions presented to him, he acts childish resorting to name calling to increase ratings. He isn't very diplomatic. We all know that the president needs to work with leaders around the world, it's very important to foster working relationships under very difficult situations. \nVoters in the USA need to really take a good look at Mr Trump, do some research & LISTEN to what he is saying and make an informed decision. We need to do that for any contender for the presidency that we may be considering.\nIf you are considering Donald Trump you may want to see this documentary called \nTrump: What’s The Deal?\nClick link below or copy/paste into your browser:\nhttp://www.inquisitr.com/2299121/donald-trump-does-not-want-you-to-see-this-movie-about-him-but-you-can-watch-it-right-here/#utm_campaign=SocialFlow&utm_source=Facebook&utm_medium=Feed",

Does \"solving America's problems\" release him from the ordinary duty to have good manners? Oh, he thinks he's above that. Manners are for the little people, not Trump. He is a narcissist, and we've already suffered through 8 years of one as POTUS. Trump will be far worse than Obama, if elected. Trump is a recent GOPer, formerly an ardent democrat. His nomination will give the election to the democrats. If by some miracle he is elected, he will keep his campaign promises as well as he kept his wedding vows to his first two wives. He is not a good businessman, having 4 businesses go bankrupt. He made his money like a mob boss, in casinos. If he is the nominee, the campaign will resemble a 3 Stooges pie fight, with insults flying from him, who is super-thin-skinned and arrogant. He is a poser, playing to what the American people want to hear, tapping into their anger. He is dangerous and not to be trusted.",

However;  maybe he did not and / or was not able to directly say he was not a part of wars against good women & there's a chance he does not really comprehend yet how to correctly communicate with all &/or most women of good kinds yet like many men often say that women are sometimes a mystery unto the men who don't seem to have a clue what some women if not all women attempt to some times communicate unto other men & women like some if not all women try to comprehend what some if not all men some times communicates seems to be a mystery unto some if not all women! Correct? Maybe? Hm ? So maybe what Donald trump is really saying then is he does not comprehend yet how to communicate and relate and public relations correctly with folks and because business and money he relates unto more better than he does with folks?!? So does Donald trump sometimes get as angry enraged as Disney's Donald duck that sometimes results in folks failing to comprehend Donald trump more misidentifying Donald trump as being mean & cruel unto males and females both alike equally sometimes asks meow? So Donald trump is saying save USA s financially economic business life support systems first and everyone and everything else comes second?!? But real life says save diversity and commonalty combos like clean air to breathe and clean drinking water and folks and creatures and nature and etc together or none at all including democracy and civil rights and reasonable democratic freedoms ; but what politicians and Donald trump tries to do is save economy and freedoms from debts or civilrights or etc., & real life just does not function nor exist that way! Correct? Maybe? Hm ? Should Donald trump be trying to apply for a job at us treasures beuru of fiscal services &/or us treasury instead maybe? I don't know! Do you? Asks meow? Signed meow.",

Politicians have been running this country so far any look where it has gotten us . I feel its time for a business man to show all these politicians how its done .

I'm voting for who I think can do a good job as President. History paints quite an unflattering portrait of John F. Kennedy's as a \"family man\" (whatever that means), and if we're looking for a President who didn't respect women as much as he should have, JFK is a good example. But was he an effective leader? Absolutely. If I want to vote on someone who based on their morality and character, I'll go back to my old Baptist church and vote for the new pastor. But if I want to vote for someone who I think can run the country (or their share of the control anyway) in an effective manner and get things done, even if they're morally bankrupt at heart, I'll vote in a Presidential election.",

Excuse me bud you know that's never the right question, and you could be a little handy and respectful when we are experiencing this. I am glad you think that our president should care about 100% of the population. But you have to see the fact, do guys get comments about their physical appearance as much as females? No!

Bush, during his controversial hijack of the 2000 election & Sept. 11th controversy.  The Zionist media is complicit with telling you how to think & who to hate.\n\nLike Malcolm X said, \"[The media] tells us to love whom they will....and HATE whom they will\".  Donald Trump's remark are no more HEINOUS than the ACTUAL CRIMES Barack Obama committed AFTER he received a Nobel Peace Prize!!  No different than the crimes George W. Bush committed.  Both of those individuals have a LIST of violations (and if you are intelligent, I shouldn't have to list them on a message board). Yet, this SAME MEDIA that CHEERED Bush when he was popular......BURIES any controversy about Obama.....they have a problem with Donald's blunt way of dealing with people??  No. There's more to this.  Stop being robots.  Obviously, Trump is the unpredictable relative THE ELITE wants to keep away from their circle.  They can't pull his strings and that burns them.",

He was called out on national television for making repeated disparaging remarks about women and he responded by making further disparaging remarks about the person that raised the issue. Mr. Trump is use to only dealing with people that are generally at economic effect of him and so he has been able to set his own rules of behavior. Well now he is in the public square, auditioning to be elected to the highest office in the land, and the rules are very different. Everything that you have said and done in the past is fair game. Clearly he doesn't like it and responds like a bratty child. It would appear that his emotional development was arrested somewhere back in his twenties. The Republican party understands that more than half of the electorate is female and that Mr. Trump is providing a treasure trove of attack ad materials for the Democrats which will make it impossible for him to get the majority of the female vote. They will never let Trump be their candidate despite his short term popularity in the polls. He will either bow out in the next few months, claiming that he was treated unfairly, or he will mount a third party candidacy which will have limited success and insure that Clinton will be the next President.",

They can start by getting rid of Kelly (move her to one of the worst networks....MSNBC) Wallace, Hannity, and O'Reilly. Oh, and if by some stroke of luck that Karl Rove is still lurking around this network somewhere with his stupid white board....get rid of him, too, as he seems to talk more out of his rear end than his mouth anymore.",

Nah, I just think he is intentionally being an asshole; making the most disrespectful, most insulting, or \"ballsiest\" comments that he can think of. Trump is doing this because he knows very well it gets him attention, and that it rallies up hardcore conservatives across the country. He is presenting himself as a no-bullshit, anti-politically correct, rebellious pundit who is sticking it to the left-wing establishment and is \"telling it like it is.\" A huge amount of conservatives eat that shit up and make them want to support him. In reality, though, Donald Trump is simply being a huge bully and an an asshole to everyone - going out of his way to insult and humiliate whomever doesn't like him. He is not a right-wing hero any more than Hilary Clinton is a left-wing hero. Plus, I doubt he will fully stand by everything that he says throughout his campaign, especially what he said about Megyn Kelly and Mexican migrants.",

But I will agree that he is being treated unfairly by the GOP and people are desperately taking shots at him to try and limit the damage he does. If he doesn't win the nomination (probably not), he sure as hell will make the Republican party miserable.",

Why else would the only female moderator ask a question about some Twitter battle that took place years ago between two entertainers and just happen to be between Trump and a women.Trump has no scandals lurking out there because the way he is being attacked we would already know about them. Seriously, what did her questions have to do with what this country needs? If she or any other '' News '' person out there wants to be taken serious then they should be asking all of the candidates specifically about how their plan to create jobs, rebuild our military, secure the border, improve our healthcare system, the Iran deal, or Taxes. They did not ask Trump the same type of questions as the other candidates but instead ask him personal questions that have nothing to do with the election. Trump honestly answers questions and he is not in the pockets of lobbyists. He speaks from the heart and he has actually motivated the Republican party. This is what we need if we want to beat Hillary or we will end up with more of the same. It is time for the adults to clean up the mess Obama has us in. We need a strong President that can negotiate and speak the truth and not worry if their tone is making someone feel like, possibly, that they are being targeted when in fact it is only their overwhelming sense of insecurity and low self esteem that evokes a total lack of self confidence to the point where they unable to tell the difference. The Fox ''News'' anchors will be taken seriously when they start asking fair relevant questions so we can elect a strong leader and also when they stop trying to make a great candidate look bad so they can get their own name in the news headlines.",

This is the first time I've heard the term \"war on women\", but it's plain as day who created it. Only the feminazis could come up with than one. It's a good example of the saying, \"A best defense is a good offense\". There has been a gender war alright and at some secret location is a huge landfill with millions of men's balls who have allowed themselves to be emasculated.\n\nI'm not going to fall for political theatrics, so I remain very skeptical about Trump. I seriously doubt that he is any different from any other politician, I have to admit it would be interesting what kind of President he would be. He would be a hell of a lot better than Obama and Bush, but then a service monkey would be better than them.. Can any billionaire be trusted, not on your life. There could be an unintentional side effect to Trump's attack on political correctness. He could very well cause a release of so much American conservative restrained anger that a chain reaction causes conservatives to fight back. Once conservatives realize just how powerful they really are, it will be the swan song for the militant left-wing. It is entirely possible that we are seeing the very beginning of the Second American Revolution.\n\nThomas",

If you can call these events debates, frankly, because the format is fucking terrible. But it came off as a desperate and really quite pathetic swipe over a pretty irrelevant issue, but it was asked with the tone and demeanor of hard hitting journalism. Like she was grilling Nixon or something. And if I recall correctly they basically followed this up by asking the other candidates if they were sexist or not, as if that somehow de-Trumps the loaded Trump lines of questioning that would dominate the evening. \"I mean, we were being fair here, we asked the other candidates too!\" Plus it's like, if this guy is such a gaffe machine, and it's so hard for you to take him seriously (and I don't disagree), then give him the rope and let him hang himself. That's more to the point of what I mean when I say this came off very desperate, very pathetic. It's like, \"Me too! I can stump the Trump too!

How obvious was it that they ALL felt that the only people that belonged there were a political class of trained statesmen?\n\nTell me again that our political process isn't an old boys club run by that very crowd INCLUDING liberal liar media to drumb out people they don't think belong BEFORE they treat the rest of the candidates with equal consideration.

We are FREE...and these sleazy politicians want our political process CLOSED to everyone they don't feel measures up! \n\nRemember the last time that happened?

That basically means there are a lot of scared Republican leaders who don't like that possibility. If money = free speech, trump did not buy politicians. He simply utilized his freedom of speech, and for me, all those other candidates are bought and paid for by other billionaires. The difference is Trump, unlike those other rich, puts his money where his mouth is and he runs. Why not just let all those other oligarchs run themselves. From the 'left' and the 'right'. Then you don't need a middle man like Ted Cruz. You can just vote for the Koch brothers directly or Shelden Adelson. The fact is, they don't want to run. Trump is stepping out of the model where the rich hire politicians to be 'their voice' and strengthened by Citizens United they can 'fully express that voice'.\n\nI say more power to Trump.",

    "commentText": "If you believe there is a war on women in the United States or in the West you are an idiot. You would have to be a fool to be so blind to reality and a mindless zombie to be so malleable to feminist rhetoric in the mainstream media. What we really have is feminist projection. Feminism in the mainstream media, government, legal system and college campuses is at war with men. When you have televised public debates decreeing that men are obsolete like they are machinery and not human beings, then saying there is a war on men is not hyperbolic. These debates have actually happened at Intelligence Squared and the Munk Debates over the last three years. Hanna Rosin and Maureen Dowd have been openly leading this argument on TV, in newsprint, in books and in public debates over the last three or more years. Of course if we did this to women suddenly it is unacceptable, but since it is men it is suddenly something to encourage and even promote. \n\nMen make up the majority of the homeless, suicides, workplace deaths and poor, neglected and injured war veterans. These men are completely ignored in this so-called “patriarchy”, where feminists would have us believe the top 0.1% of men represents all men. Men make up the minority of university students and are behind women at every level of education from kindergarten to master’s level. Yet despite this most of the gender specific education programs, funding and affirmative action policies are for women and girls in education. Men have a substantially lower life expectancy, suffer a greater disease burden for a number of illnesses and yet do not receive anywhere near a proportionate level of health funding. Men have no reproductive rights and are discriminated against in corrupt family courts and lopsided divorce settlements. Some men are even imprisoned through divorce and family court and effectively made into alimony and financial slaves by their ex-wives. This is despite these men either being unemployed or being ordered to pay money that exceeds their income to their ex-wives while they sit at home and don’t work. Then there are the men supporting children that are not even theirs because of paternity fraud. I could keep going on further. \n\nThis is not a man’s world, there is no war on women. We live in a society where the state is used by feminism and the women that explicitly or implicitly support it, to rob men of their wealth, their rights and fair treatment before the law and government support. Whenever anyone actually attempts to address the issues facing men that I have mentioned, they are blocked by feminist lobby groups and officials in the government and in the legal system. Or they are shamed, silenced or ignored by the feminist mainstream media. Or they are bullied, threatened and vilified by feminist gender ideologues who assassinate their careers and reputations. There is no fictitious war on women. There is indeed a war on men though and rest assured if this continues to be ignored then the epidemic of fatherlessness and the boy crisis in education will finish the United States and the rest of West. There will be nowhere for feminists to hide from the public scrutiny when all of the chickens come home to roost. The sheeple will get exactly what they deserve for ignoring men and boys. I will have no sympathy for their future plight if they continue to do nothing and let feminism continue with business as usual while they destroy and pillage the United States and the rest of Western civilisation.",

Its not like its a joke, china did it hundreds of years ago and it worked. and don't even bring up the berlin wall because that split a country in half. he is so right on his stance towards political correctness in this country. im probly gonna get smashed for being racist because I called Obama a pussy. He is also right about people not having incentives to work anymore. I mean I am better of living on welfare and gaurentted $45000 a year rather than busting my ass and getting paid barley that. People just think he a joke because of tv show that portrays him as being ruthless but being ruthless in the corporate world and in the political world is needed. the big deal that everybody complains about this country from all aspects of parties is that no candidate ever stands by their word. Donald trump has no other benefits other that making this country great again.

I think you and Chris are cowards trying to represent the Republican Nom, but you guy's make stuff up and really represent all the stuff Americas tired of. Thank You for giving Hope to Donald, and Thank you for showing us even if he doesn't win That it will be because\" Megyn Clinton\" shows us how dumb and tragic the bull is in America!!!!!

Women in America can vote, have independent lives, get jobs, divorce their husbands, and go out in public on their own.

You want to hear some disparaging remarks about women Mr. Trump? Your mom's a dirty filthy fat fuck cunt waffle of a woman that birthed a honky nazi fucking shit bucket. How's that for not having any political correctness any more? Fuck you Donald Trump. Your grandparents were German Donald Trump? Guess we can call you a fucking Nazi from here until the day you die. Your mother was Scottish Mr. Trump? Guess we can say that she liked it in the ass from sheep.

All that says to me, is that anyone can go up on stage, insult Mexicans and almost every race but whites, state their \"honest\" opinion, and then earn the crowd's applause. \n\nWhat bullshit is this?

Im sire your life experiences have been shockingly similar. You know what, all this under the table bribery and corporate influence on our politics is so old hat. Let's just elect trump, make the CEO of Comcast his VP, all the board members of the world banks and ISPs his cabinet and the head of the NRA the secretary of defense. America has been in this situations before, but we were saved from catastrophe by a man by the name of Franklin D. Roosevelt. His socialist - democratic policies were what made America the nation it was when the majority of fox news watchers were growing up. Yet they forget that so easily. So thanks all you conservatives who keep voting for the same corporate shills and lobbyist puppets every election cycle. Same goes for the Democrats. It's thanks to you fine patriots that America is split in half and plummeting into the ocean like the Titanic, an event most fox news viewers were probably alive to see. It's time we let someone into office who isn't completely detached from reality like every single republican candidate and the majority of their voting base. Satan bless America",

So you're doing everything you can to keep your party in political power.\n\nStop. You're a joke of a news network as it is. Every intelligent, civil human in the country knows that Fox is to news as professional wrestling is to sports. You are, and I can't stress this enough, entertainment for people that share your archaic conservative views. People come to your network for inflation of their own ego, rather than to keep up with current events and expand their understanding of the world. \n\nMegyn Kelly, Bill O'Reilley, Sean Hannity. These people are not journalists. They are merely social commentators. They knee jerk to popular Republican discussion points, feeding their viewers extreme, nonsensical opinions, repeated to the point of false validity.\n\nFox News isn't the only corrupt news network, but it's certainly the most repulsive on national television. I'll be happy to see it fall apart as the new generation wakes up and, with complete free speech from the Web, collectively catches onto your bullshit.\n\n\n             ~TheGoldfish",

Your only truly offended if you are one ( a dog or eat like a pig). You majorly offended me and plenty others last night, So you should be the FIRST to know it's impossible to go through life without offending others! You are the pot calling the kettle black. You were the worst example to women last night than any other so called professional I know of. So Sad!",

    "commentText": "Most on-line polls from Time Magazine to the Atlantic are showing even these comments have not impacted his lead. The question asked at the beginning of the debate \"Is there anyone on stage who is unwilling to pledge your support to the eventual nominee of the Republican Party, and pledge to not run an independent campaign against that person?\" was not asked at the first debate in 2011. They even reversed the question so the show of hands would represent a negative condition \"anyone unwilling to pledge your support\". Probably phrased as such because it's less impactful to have Donald Trump the only one not raising his hand... FOX News is going to continue to be very hard on Trump. They likely want to do everything they can to get him to go Independent ASAP so that they can devote more air-time to future the Republican nominee and mitigate the division of the party caused by Trump's current lead. What's funny about this is how transparent it makes FOX News when it comes to manipulation. If Mr. Trump holds out on going Independent the Republican party will have little choice but to nominate him or face that catastrophic division that would guarantee the Democrat candidate a win. It was a entertaining moment when Trump pointed out most of the candidates on the panel had taken donations from him and returned favors. He's challenging the corruption of American politics that for too long we have accepted as the norm. That message will resonate strongly with both Democrats and Republicans. I believe he stands a chance of winning even if runs Independent. Of course the big question is what if he wins? His message is \"Make America great again\" but what if the seemingly unbalanced trade agreements are just part of the globalization efforts that keep World War III from occurring? What if he's overvaluing the US on the global stage in 2015? we are a very long way from the golden era following World War II. What if things are really so bad under the hood that these national agreements are really all that's holding things together? If that's the case a non-politician like Trump could destroy everything. But even then would that be so bad? If there is a facade it needs to be removed and no politician would ever do that.",

He better come up with some new material and fast. He still has a year to go. If he keeps repeating what he thinks America's problems are without having solutions to these problems he will fail to keep the momentum he has right now.\n\nOn the other hand, Rand Paul impressed me with is unwillingness to stand by and listen to this overhyped windbag. Rand has very detailed and specific plans to help bring America back to prominence.\n\nRand is the Man!",

Trump hits back at people of both genders but she picked out adjectives he only used with women and creates 'a gender war'. But she is just giving him a small taste of what he'll run into with the Democrats. It's impossible for the Democrats (or Republicans) to win arguing the issues. Why? Because Trump can do whatever is right for America. All other candidates are owned by special interests, lobbyists, and donors, and do their bidding. So to win, their only recourse is to smear Trump in any and every way imaginable. The Democrats are going to dish out to Trump 10 times what Kelly did. Picture it now. An old photo of Trump when he was 14 is found. He is shown dropping a chewing gum wrapper on the sidewalk. Huge front page head lines, story after story on TV, \"Is a litter bug like this fit to be president!?\"",

Thank You for giving Hope to Donald, and Thank you for showing us even if he doesn't win That it will be because\" Megyn Clinton\" shows us how dumb and tragic the bull is in America!!!!!\n\n\nThank you Sincerely,\n\nA lost viewer of \"FOX BULL ZONE.\"\n\nP.S.

But it could very well have been the temperament of the host of a reality TV show that was all about being brash, rude and outlandish for ratings. And judging from the success of the show I'd say he succeeded.\n\nBut here's a news Flash Megyn. Celebrity Apprentice is over and so is Trump's tenure as it's host. And Donald Trump is no longer a Reality TV host. He is 'now' running for President. Give him the benefit of the doubt that he will adjust his temperament to fit his new role if he wins. Fact is, Megyn, you don't have much room to criticize other people's temperament anyway!",

I'm a life long conservative who would rather vote for Hillary Clinton or honestly, even Barak Obama...before I voted for this megalomaniac. \n\nPoor Megyn Kelly. She asked a legitimate, journalist question and was completely disrespected by a rude and unreflective person. \n\nIf I ever was placed before Trump in a public setting, I would  make clear that I know he isn't a self made man but rather a silver spoon, who inherited all of his wealth. I would point out his obvious hypocrisy when it comes to hiring illegal aliens who added to his own wealth. What we should do is audit his businesses and remove the wealth he acquired via illegal workers before we deport anyone.  \n\nI'm not a moderate GOP conservative. I believe Obama, Rubio, Cruz and Jindal are not constitutionally eligible to be President.  I can point to 23 pre-2008 attempts by Congress to change the Presidential Eligibility requirements to allow someone like Obama to be President....all of which failed.    So, yes, Trump's remarks on eligibility actually agree with my own thinking so label me a nut if you must. But take it from a nut, we can't elect this nut Trump.\n\nOur country has been divided for the pat 8 years by design. We need to come together in the middle and solve some problems. This dude isn't going to pull it off.  Also, we cant have a Bush or Clinton in office. That's just ridiculous. No dynasties.",
