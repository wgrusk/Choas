So, we can see, what \"the law\" is, actually has not much to do with what is right and what is wrong. ps. bush and bill clinton both had blood on their hands re: nafta. Illegal immigrants took our jobs? guess again. Someone gave your jobs away, legally. Someone called the US government. PS. undocumented workers contribute 12 BIllion with a \"B\" dollars a year to US social security. Go thank Pedro for shoveling cow shit on the grave yard shift at the milk factory so you can afford to buy your milk, lazy hateful white ignorant mother fuckers, because without Pedro, no social security for you!

America is a melting pot of all races and nationalities. However, you should come in the correct and responsible way so you can be tracked by the U.S. just like all the other legal Americans. You have no rights and no say what happens or goes on with you or anything in this country. For those of you who get mad and say they should stay is irresponsible and disgusting. You should be sent out as well for insighting international breaking and entering. When you have to jump over a wall or swim across a river you know your breaking the law and doing something your not suppose to. So don't say a thing when you get deported or thrown in jail. Your a criminal and a disgrace.
