Mercy is kindness. To answer biblical questions and solutions. \nSaul starts very well. 1 Samuel 10:12. Reminds me of the church of Ephesus in Revelation 2.)\n1Sa 28:4 And the Philistines gathered themselves together,  and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together,  and they pitched in Gilboa.\n(Philistine the old hatred towards Christianity. Global vagabond. Tares. The serpent seeds. Copying everything that Christianity has. Two-faced pretending to be religious. Philistine is Mycenaean. Ezekiel 25:15.)\n1Sa 28:5 And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid,  and his heart greatly trembled. \n(Now, this is the downfall of Saul. Saul turned into Baal worship bending over to lords of nations for bribes (donations) to wreck the land of living. 1 John 4:18.)\n1Sa 28:6 And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.\n(No real man of God will answer him. Proverbs 28:9. Rejected. Get out of my face. Matthew 7:23.)\n1Sa 28:7 Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her.
