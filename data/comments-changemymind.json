Yes, Latinos are, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, considered white, but look at the \"Hispanic or Latino/Not Hispanic or Latino;\" it still shows a vast higher level of criminal disparity among non-Hispanic whites. After this, many would argue percentages. There's a number that continues to be made public: 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the shadows. If that number is true, there is an even higher disparity, percentage wise, in the number of white, non-Hispanic or Latinos than there is in white, Hispanic or Latinos.",

We can build a fence around our house for protection but why whould i build a fence around such a large piece of land? If usa portraits itself as the greatest nation on earth then people from 3rd world countries will always will try to immigrate to the best possible situation for themselves, and i think they should cause thats what will create balance to our society, wich is the entire earth population. As a society we are as strong as our weakest link, thus the strong should lift the weak and not put it down. Most of the people in the world are poor, just imagine how they could benefit our society wit the right platform and tools, and im not saying that usa should support the entire world but i wish that more strong countries will try lift the weak and put there money to that instead of creating destructive tools and building giant walls.",

Very first thing that popped into my mind was... \"So what is supposed to happen to all the millions of animals that routinely cross the border all the time as part of their usual migration patterns in those area while feeding, migrating, etc?\"\n\nYeah, sure, ok... they'll adapt over time (or die). As I'm sure they did after the Great Wall of China occurred.\n\nIn concept, I like the idea of the wall... but in reality, it seems like a huge ill thought-out idea.  What kind of ill-thought out consequences would their be for the wildlife directly confronted with this new obstacle?  Has anybody studied or documented what effect the Great Wall of China had on the animals stuck on one side or the other of it?  How long it took for affected species to adapt?\n\nAlso, being a native Californian (unfortunately) I realize that our economy demands that we have cheap exploitable labor at our disposal. It's just the way it is.  \n\nTo make things fair. Something I've often suggested is the following. Make it so that a child born in the US is not automatically considered a citizen.... unless at least one of it's parents is a natural born, or legally naturalized citizen of the US. That's it. That's all you'd have to do.\n\nI'm tired as hell of having these folks rush to make it past the finish line of the border just so their kids can be born here and have MY tax dollars spent on THEIR education (public education) and THEIR healthcare (feds allowing hospitals to write-off a bunch of the fees that won't be paid by low income immigrants, who do you think pays for that? We Do!), etc.\n\nAnd then... ya gotta imagine like in a movie scene where the lead guy of this Wall project is all leaning back on it.. arms crossed.. feeling proud and admiring his work... when all of a sudden, maybe 100 yards away from him he starts to hear a sound.... then something starts burrowing up out of the soil just on this side of the wall.

In brief, I might propose that the Wall is a symbol - and symbols are important, and have been throughout history. I know that this doesn't point to a statistic or other more tangible citation for the argument, but I bet that a guy as well-researched as yourself understands the palpability of such a symbol.\n\nHey, it's been super refreshing to hear your Socratic approach in the public forum -- our young people especially have been starved of real argument... it's like coming up for air after writhing under the waters of irreproachable moral relativism. *GASP!\n\nP.

Even if it was possible to build a wall that most people couldn't defeat with a $5 modification on a $15 dollar grappling hook, it would cost billions if not trillions of dollars not to mention maintenance of said wall.  The cost of continual satellite images with boarder patrol is more effective and cheaper.  \n\nAnother option is to produce high resolution 360 degree cameras (with infrared) on poles that an AI monitors for movement and notifies a volunteer or min wage work force to pick up people.  The poles would have ping a server every 5 mins to make sure nothing has happened to the camera and the AI should be able to pick up camera blockage.  \n\nTunnels would still be a problem but a seismic shockwave detector might help with that and provide scientists with valuable earthquake information.  \n\nThe \"Wall\" they are building now is just for show and it is an expensive one at that.  http://www.usdebtclock.org/",

A new President will take office on December 1 in Mexico, hopefully during these next six years there will be a substantial change, both at the economic and social levels. The government of the United States has every right to build a wall if it means protecting its citizens for them. Mexico has the same problem, many illegal immigrants enter the country, some stay to live but others are only passing through to enter the United States; but some also commit crimes within our territory. Building the wall does not violate human rights in any way, on the contrary, problems such as police brutality on the border would be avoided. The only thing I do not agree with is that Mexico pays for the wall, that must be paid by the United States; Mexico should do its part by generating better and good jobs for its people, so that they do not try to cross into the United States illegally.",

Please remember this as well food for thought this great nation was built on the blood, sweat, tears and countless great sacrifices of Immigrants it was built by their backbone. Not one person in this great country is a Native American other than the Native Americans.

It is common to arrest, process and deport a person only to arrest them again a few days later. The majority of the captures I was a apart of were the same individuals and groups over and over. They tear out the filling in car seats and hide inside the seat (with someone else then sitting on them as the seat), in engine compartment and storage containers. When you're willing to risk as much as these people do to get here (many die of dehydration, heat exhaustion or by animal attack en route) a wall is not a major obstacle.

    "commentText": "Steven asked for an alternative to the wall.\nWell, these are my thoughts, with a focus on Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras:\n—Most immigrants are leaving their countries because of very difficult situations. If they truly had a choice, they'd stay. Don't you think they miss where they come from? Sometimes they spend decades without going back. And why do I say they don't really have a choice? Imagine that you live in a neighborhood controlled by a gang, like Mara Salvatrucha or Barrio 18. Not how they're in Los Angeles, since that's \"light\" compared to how it is in Central America (you can find documentaries with very strong images). If you live in this type of neighborhood, you will either A) be extorted, assaulted or murdered, or B) have to join the gang. With these \"options\", ANYONE would rather die (or be raped, attacked, etc.) crossing Mexico and several frontiers just to get away from it.\n—You might think it's our problem, but the US has a HUGE responsibility in this. You'd have to read about the \"American Imperialism\" in Latin America during the last century, besides the Guatemalan and Salvadoran Civil Wars, to understand how it's even right to say the US created the gangs and keeps perpetuating our poverty and corruption.\n—With this strong responsibility, INSTEAD OF BUILDING A WALL TO JUST EVADE THE PROBLEM, the US should spend more time, people and money to help us solve our issues. If you're at fault of something, it's not fair to leave the victim, make it look as the enemy and act as if history doesn't exist only because you're starting to experience the consequences of your own actions.\n—By helping our countries, our people would have NO necessity to leave. Therefore, a wall is not the solution, since there are deeper roots that will create more and more immigrants even if you build a whole fort along the nation.\n\nThere. I might not have changed your mind, but hopefully you'll try to get more background information for a problem that seems present but has been growing since the 80s. A wall solves nothing; the US shouldn't run away from its responsibilities.",

On the drugs side, you must control the consumer before you control the distributer/producer.. theyre beinging it iver by demand.. why dont they send some to columbia? They produce their own... on the crime side(Homicide rates)  very good point i cant argue with you there.. as far as taxes... who do you get these stats from if they are under the radar? Say you have 11 million imiggrants could be way more could be way less.. how would you know if they are under the radar? Thats only an estimate. Ive worked with gentleman that us fake information fake names etc. Whos fault is that if theyre already doing that? Companies that still give work to those people some knowing for a fact that isnt their correct information. Again supply vs demand. Not enough workers not enough producers especially fields like construction/ restaurants / etc. Welfare they cant get because they dont even have a social. You say no wall equals bigger problem because it keeps growing... how do you narrow out the good from bad? An immigration reform. The bad will not want to do everything legally the good will pay what they have to to get that green card. Theres people that save up for that with hope that there will be a reform. That is the solution. Immigration reford for those already here working the procees is expensive. Make it $15,000 im almost certain these people will pay that because that is all they want! The hard workers.. then they will pay taxes because they wont be scared to be looked for.. if theygive heir name and adress theyre afraid to put a target on themselves. Thats why they dont pay taxes. Some jobs wont hire and out of necessity, they join bad programs, they steal, they kill. Because they have to eat. Just like any other American. All i have seen (and i dont go off of these so called “statistics” because they arent accurate. They dont ask every single person they ask a few and us it as a majority) is that the more you try to regulate, block out, the bigger the problem will be. Its like gun control... the only people that will suffer are the law abiding citizens. With the wall, mass deportations, the only people being kept out are the ones that really want to be here. Criminals will get to where they want regardless of walls, laws,  rules, whatever. The wall isnt the only way to get in. There are tunnels way deeper then the 6 ft that they want, ways to climb a huge wall. If a scorchinng hot desert doesnt stop them, if a shark infested ocean doesnt stop them, if all these sicknesses on ships didnt stop the europeans, nothing will. If you cant fight it, use it to your advantage. Dont always look at the bad side of things. If its broken, fix it",

Nonetheless, it must be really hard to find people that can give you stadistics to support their arguments on the spot. \n\nPersonally, in regards to this topic, building the wall would not stop people from coming in illegally. For starters, they are coming here because their own countries are facing dire circumstances and the government are not acting effectively to restore peace. To stop them from coming, the US would have to convince them that they either don´t have a reason to come here or that they have a reason to stay in their country. Besides, illegal immigration is already a very profitable illegal business, which gives the smuggling criminals an incentive to find ways around the wall measure (dig a tunnel under, come prepared to climb it or blow a hole in it, etc.). \n\nStrengthening border security is a good idea, but I do not think it´s realistic to expect Border agents (who are just as human as anybody else) to monitor the entire expanse of desert wilderness 24/7 every day. \n\nI was surprised to hear the argument of \"why don´t we just let everybody come in, but force them to pay taxes so they generate more revenue for the country\". It´s a fair argument. \"If you are coming here, you cannot expect us to take care of you.\"",

    "commentText": "So Ive been doing research on my own about where Crowder is getting  \"illegal immigrants make up 3.5% of the population but commit 37% of the murders in this country\". There are many things wrong with this. So in a previous video where he does a pro and con of trump he brings up this statistic too and reveals the source that he got it from was an article from The Hill. The article uses data from a federal study that takes a random sample size of 1000 criminal aliens in to make an estimate of all criminal aliens in the nation (a study populations of 250,000). They do this because there is no comprehensive nationwide crime statistical study available that include illegal immigrants. In this study they estimate that 25,064 illegal aliens were arrested of homicide. It clearly says in the footnotes that an arrest does not mean a conviction. Crowder then takes this number of \"25,064 \" and compares to the number of homicides that were actually committed from 2005-2008 and comes to his conclusion of \"37%\" \n\nI don't think you can go around so surely telling people that 3.5% of a population commits 37 percent of murder in the nation when the study is based on a sample size and not a comprehensive study. Not to mention that the sample is only meant to study the population of criminal aliens who were arrested for a crime and not the entire illegal alien community itself. AND they misinterpret the data and assume arrests are convictions?? This is absurd",

    "commentText": "I have a suggestion for Crowder's \"Change My Mind\" segments.  If this can be adapted into the planning of these segments, an attempt needs to be made to inform the public of your next topic and when and where the topic will be discussed. It is apparent that Crowder has done some research and often sites statistics in these discussions. I encourage this, and I appreciate the need to encounter unstaged, unscripted, live discussions on hot button topics. However, as the segments stand, it creates an uneven platform for debate or intellectual insight since Crowder comes prepared with information to backup his view on a topic while his subjects are responding on the spot with no time to defend their position. When put on the spot and not given equal time to defend the subject's stance on the topic, most people are programmed to respond in an emotional way. It causes a meltdown in the conversation, and continues to give Crowder an upper hand. It makes for decent entertainment, but if the segment is designed to challenge Crowder's viewpoint on a topic and promote higher thought, it falls short. So, give your participant crowd a chance at a more even playing field by allowing them to do their research and prepare for the next topic. You'll still get the emotionally charged crowd and the unsupported arguments in these segments. Keep the segments live and public to maintain the reality appeal. But promote better intellectual debate by planning the time, location, and topic of your next segment, so that your participants can better challenge your own prepared and researched viewpoint on these hot button topics.",

It only addresses a symptom, not the root problem.\n\nBuilding a wall is bone headed and it feels a lot like doubling down on our current immigration policies which are completely broken. I believe that the shadow economy created by illegal immigration is no accident and is caused by  policies DESIGNED to create an artificially cheap labor market.\n\nWe'll set aside for now, the fact that most illegal immigrants are people who entered legally and have overstayed their visa status. \n\nMany people will agree that illegal immigrants should come here legally. So the first thing we can do is to try and fix that.\nSo the first question is: How can we make it easier for immigrants to choose to enter the country legally instead of illegally?\nThink about this. Why are people choosing to risk their life and spend thousands of dollars crossing illegally instead of using a legal alternative?\nIs entering the U.S with the purpose of working legally that much  more difficult than entering illegally? The answer is probably yes.\n\nFor a person who chooses to cross the border illegally, this is no small decision. It commonly costs thousands of dollars to pay a coyote to be smuggled in, literally risking their lives to come here and become an underpaid part of an underclass.  The fact that people make this choice over legal immigration points to the fact that coming (and staying) legally is much more difficult if not impossible. And in fact it is. Depending on the country the process of obtaining a Visa is onerous, expensive and not guaranteed. I won't get into the details, but it's very hard, expensive and time consuming. It's designed to only allow high skill foreign workers, not unskilled laborers. \nIt seems like there is literally no other recourse for an unskilled worker from Mexico to come here and just work. If that's what they want to do, then let's let them.\nTimes have changed. The economic reality is that we need this cheap labor in the market. If all these people are coming and the vast majority of them are working, then that means we need them. So let's fix this. How?\n\nWe need to make coming into the country legally a much easier, cheaper and safer alternative than crossing illegally.\nThere are pros and cons to this approach, but I think there are many more benefits than not.\n\nThe debate should be about this, because there are a lot of different points to be discussed. It shouldn't be about how do we keep these people out, but rather, given the economic realities how do we let a lot more people in legally in an orderly fashion. \n\nTLDR; \nWe need a jobs visa program for unskilled laborers coming in. The program should be designed to make legal immigration a better alternative to illegal immigration. This would be far more effective than a wall which symbolizes a doubling down of the existing shit policies and does not acknowledge current economic realities.",

    "commentText": "Why not just legalize and regulate the main reasons why most illegal immigrants from the south enter the US? Marijuana and other drugs!!! Items controlled by drug cartels. Take enough money out of the cartels hands and maybe the local police and governments in the south can fight against the corruption that fuels a lot of the exodus. Take enough money out of the cartels hands and they won't be able to keep the politicians in their back pockets because the revenue the governments receive is primarily from its citizens and not its illegal drug smuggling operations lead by the cartels. Maybe then these illegals or undocumented individuals could actually go through the correct procedures to enter the US legally without feeling like they needed to flee due to unsafe, life-threatening circumstances. Maybe, given time, the local governments, police forces and citizens in the south can turn their communities into respectable places to live without fear of being executed for even simply just casting a vote or running in opposition to a known/alleged criminal. Who knows, maybe then you might see a mass migration of US born fleeing to the south across a border that now Mexico wants to build a wall on. And that's how you get Mexico to pay for the wall. A wall that makes sense to some in theory but isn't the solution or end all be all. \n   By the way, I know legalizing drugs in the US isn't the only fix but it's a start. If alcohol, tobacco and pharmaceuticals are legal, attribute to many deaths a year and are regulated to some degree then why can't we do the same for, at the very least, marijuana. At least there's no known cases of overdose deaths or cancers from marijuana, which has way more positive uses than negative, than alcohol, tobacco and pharmaceuticals. And illegal immigration to the US isn't strictly confined to Mexico. Guatemala, Honduras,  El Salvador, China and many other countries contribute to the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants currently residing in the US. The fact of the matter is a wall only gives a sense of security and only band-aids a wider issue that the US faces from all sides of the globe. I'm not saying that we, as a country, should just give up because the task at hand is great but why not at least try and implement measures that are not just one sided fixes.",

I think it's like 70% of illegal immigrants come to the US by plane so unless they can build a wall big enough to stop a plane not really going to do anything. Most of those illegal immigrants come here to visit family that are legal and they just don't go back they violate their visa. And it actually takes a lot more than just a cop seeing you out. there's channels you have to go through to get someone deported it's not just hay he's illegal immigrant immediately deportation. \n\nWe need to hold the people hiring illegal immigrants and paying them low wages possible to work responsible that's where a lot of your problem is. If they can't get work they won't want to come here. \n\nThat guy is 💯 goofy as fuck. Lol",

The Cato Institute published data showing convicted murderers per 100,000 people. 3.1 is the rate for US born, 2.6 is the rate for undocumented, and 1 is the rate for documented. \nWell if you sum these up it equals 6.7 per 100,000. 2.6 is indeed approximately 37%. \nThe problem is i think he read it wrong and just bear with me please. If you closely analyze the data you will reach a way smaller percentage when you translate the rates to the estimated population of the country.\n2.6 of 100,000 undocumented are convicted, with 12,000,000 in this country only about 312 actually murder in 1 year. \nSo 3.1% of 100,000 citizens are convicted, with 300,000,000 in this country, about 9,300 actually murder in one year. \nNow if you compare [312 vs 9,300], 312 is not even close to being 10% of the nationwide murders. \nArticles are hard to understand and easy to misinterpret, your 37% is a false reflection so i hope you dont use it anymore.

  {
    "commentText": "This comment may be perceived as one against the wall but understand that it's main goal is to make aware the costs associated with a border wall compared to other measures such as just hiring more border agents.  I understand the arguments from both sides and realize that illegal immigration isn't a light subject and I'm for controlling/eliminating illegal immigration.\n     It's already been researched and found that building a wall is going to cost two to three times more than what was first proposed of 10-15 billion dollars. Not to mention the upkeep of that wall over the years which is estimated at about $750 million/year for an entire border wall(currently the wall already in place, 650+ miles,  costs about $290 million/year). If you minus the current wall already in place and just build a wall where there isn't one, the percentage of cost per mile goes up if you still use $10 billion.  And just because you build the wall doesn't mean you get rid of border control agents altogether so you have to take that cost into account as well.  I will only use the cost of the walls construction, on the low end, for the entire 2k mile expanse and the cost of border control agents per year to determine if a wall or hiring more border control is better in the long run.\n     The US-Mexican border is roughly 2000 miles long. At a $10 billion cost, that is $5 million/mile. The average salary of a border control agent ranges between $36k-$70k per year with the median average being about $50k/year. So if we take the median average salary and divide that into the cost of the wall per mile we get 100. That means for only one year you could have 100 border control agents per mile of border or 200k border control agents monitoring the border over that year(100 agents multiplied by 2k miles). That's 10 times the amount of current border control agents that monitor both the Mexican and Canadian borders with 86% of agents currently monitoring the Mexican border per year. That 200k is also more than current enlisted US marines in the military.     \n      The $10 billion cost is in addition to what's already being spent currently on border control. You could, for that cost of the wall, hire 10k more border control agents at $50k/year for 20 years($10 billion divided by 10k agents divided by $50k). I've already stated that the current number of agents monitoring both borders is about 20k with about 86% of them or 17k that monitor just the Mexican border. At current numbers that means that there is roughly 9 agents per mile of Mexican border. If you just add 10k agents that would bring that number to 14 agents per mile per year for the next 20 years. I understand that there's 24 hours in the day and work shifts associated with that 24 hour period. With a typical 8 hour shift that's adding nearly 2 extra agents per shift, per mile for 20 years. That means better safety for the agents in place due to more agents on hand. That means more eyes on the ball every day and night for 20 years. Quick fact on the more eyes on the ball--an individual can see at least 3 miles into the distance and that is only obstructed by the curvature of the earth at ground level with no eye defect. That number is increased greatly when elevated for instance in a guard tower with or without binoculars. \n      In the end, when you look at just the cost of building an entire wall from scratch, on the low end,  compared to hiring more agents for the next 20 years it would be better to just hire more agents. You might argue what happens after that 20 years? Do we just not have agents anymore? Remember that the $10 billion is in addition to what's already being allocated for border control. Plus the additional cost of upkeep not required over that 20 years which would be, with current numbers proposed, $15 billion. There's also technology that's currently being used like drones, satellites, sensors and so on that help in controlling immigration. The tech side of it all will only improve over that 20 year period and may reduce the number of agents required to monitor. But the tech, military defense budget, the current number of military forces in countries not needed and so many other things could be argued or at least brought into the conversation in regards to this subject but again that's not what this is about. I welcome any additions or contradictions to this comment and hope that you can change my mind that a border wall is not the only answer. \n           NOTE: This comment does not take into account inflation, wage increases and the like.

(1967-2001)\nWhat a wonderful, magical, incredible place Mexico is. \nWith that said I believe I have to agree with Democrats and Liberals about not building a wall on the southern border with Mexico. Their argument against a wall is quite legitimate and factual. They claim the wall is too expensive, unnecessary, and racist. Democrats believe people will chose not to cross our border, inspite of no wall. \n*Analysis of that belief:\nBy having an open border people from anywhere and everywhere will come into the United States.\nPeople we don't know, \npeople from communist nations, socialist nations, religious fanatical nations, \nwar torn and broken nations, corrupt nations. \nQuestion:\nHow long do you think it would take with that kind of massive influx of people, to completely change everything about our Government, and our  freedoms in America ? \nNot long. \nAmerica would slip into an abyss of lawlessness, oppressive rule, anarchy and or socialism/communism. Despots will rule, crime would skyrocket to levels above and beyond the wild west years. \nIt will become so dangerous, so horrible and so prohibitive so fast that people will NEVER migrate to the USA or (whatever it's being called at that time.)\nIn essence illegal immigration, legal migration, and travel to America will completely stop. \nThe Democrats are correct about the southern border wall. \nProof of my analysis.......\n*Canada\n*UK\n*Denmark\n*Sweeden\n*Belgium\n*Germany\n*France\nThanks for listening !

The wall wouldn't actually stop anything, most of the illegal immigrants are already here. The wall would also cost more than 15 billion dollars. The wall would also take forever to build and too much money to maintain. Also, if we're still talking about the immigrants COMING here, then they will be able to simply fly over the wall. I only used information here that I checked to make sure was true, but still, if I'm wrong someone feel free to correct me and cite your sources.",

Lol. \nA funnel , a place to have people to walk threw to be accounted for, makes sense but a wall seems too berlin-esk like we might as well be on the scale of Korea North and south border. People are in fear of being separated from family(if deported)  . now if you take that fear away. The fear of being deported. People would be more inclined to register. If your picked up by the cops walking across the wilderness of the border. Your taken to a facility and you are registered and put into the system. If you don't \"live there\" and are a citizen of Mexico. They contact and say this person is registered and your citizenship is told to the other end(Mexico athorities) . if you have a summer home in Texas. And a winter home in Mexico. And are a registered person in both countries . getting through would he no problem. There would be no reason to hide. Or \"climb the wall\" if you will; when you wouldnt be met with violence and or shame or jail time. There is no reason to hide. Keep the tests. Hell make them kinda easier. 2/3 of Americans probably wouldnt be able to pass it to be honest. Lol. But the point is. Take away the fear . and these people will do whatever they want to do.\n Say. A man wakes up, planning to get into america today.  He would go to the border facility . background check. Physical . insanity test whatever you want. And if he passed then he would wait 8-10 buisness days (in Mexico) and receive a package that has his social, drivers license( or regular I.d) , birth certificate, all that stuff . and could then freely cross WHERE EVER!  at the border he would like. If a registered citizen(of Mexico and America) wanted to cross to america, in the technical since illegal way and gets *caught*. Then they can run his name and social and see he is a regular citizen and apparently a very weird person.. And picked a weird spot to cross. If they pick up someone who is not a registered citizen. They get them registered. Deported. And sent the the border to take their tests. And see if they pass or dont pass. And if they don't there should be a 3 strike rule. And after that they are deported and given a  30 60 90 180 day arrest for the offense when done multiple time. . and if your caught bringing drugs. Its 2 strikes and the sentence would be in years. First offense, 1 year. For say 1 pound of cocaine.  Or they can just be charged off the amount and type of drugs by the laws that are set in there designated country. .we still police the invisible border and deport the unregistered people ,but do it more civilly. And give them a chance to escape the poverty they live in or violence on there family. They should have no fear for wanting shelter and safety. Or a possibly better life in general.",

    "commentText": "One of the major controversial issues facing the construction of the wall, is not the fact that people will be deported. Trump has even said himself that if the people who are sent back across the border want to return, they are more than welcome to come back, but they need to do it the legal way. To analyze a proposal like this requires a lot of thought into what the construction of a wall would consist of. For starters, there are homes on the US / Mexico border that sit partially in mexico, and partially in the US, just how some homes are built in multiple states, SC / NC being a prime example. To construct the wall, those homes could not be picked up and moved, they also couldn't (and wouldn't) place a notch in the wall to accommodate houses. So now you have US Citizens who are going to lose their homes in concept of a giant wall. The other issue: Payment. Who is going to pay for the construction of an estimated \"$70 billion\" wall? Homeland estimated $21.6 billion to construct it, not including maintenance, which was projected to cost $150 Million a year. Not to destroy hopes here, but that is a big issue. The US is broke. In debt, and running on fumes. The debt has not gotten better at all. Trump said several times that Mexico would pay for the construction of the wall, but the president of Mexico had made it clear several times that this cannot and will not happen. Mexico is poor too, with over $500 billion USD worth of debt. While much lower than the US, they only have a population of roughly 112 million citizens. So who does that leave? Who can the government charge to raise enough money to build a wall? The answer is pretty simple... ALL OF US. Taxpayer dollars would go towards a bill, that bill would be used to pay the costs, and then tax increases would happen across low and middle class citizens to maintain the repair costs and maintenance.\n\nAll I am saying is, right now the US has a lot more to be worried about. I agree that illegal immigration is an issue, but have we really stopped and thought about why they don't take the legal path? Perhaps its flawed? Perhaps it takes too long? The list of reasons I can imagine vary, but America needs to observe itself before jumping into years of construction that would cost us more than most large city developments. \n\nTo add fruit to this tree though; If the wall is truly happening, use the wall as a power network for clean energy (solar would be reasonable). Start a trade network with Mexico to supply clean power, offer it to each state along the path of the wall and encourage sales. As more revenue is made from the kW per hour charges, put it back into the wall to maintain it. You are talking about a lot of money there.",

Some species will likely suffer and might go extinct. Since all nature is a balanced web entire ecosystems might be destroyed.\n\n4) Logistics - It will never work. Why? We already tried it. We already failed! To build a physical wall you need to use the police power of eminent domain. George Bush Jr. Commissioned 600 miles of  fencing along the Southern Border. FENCE not a wall. A much easier and smaller goal! They eventually have up and amended the law in favor of more electronics. Why? You have to understand that the land where the border is located is owned by Americans AND Mexicans. Also, it isn't a straight line as it looks on the map. It zigs and zags in and out of both countries. So they have to have a hearing for every owner on both sides before they can take the land for public use. This process proved so difficult and expensive the Bush administration have up on it. Also the Rio Grand! A large portion of the border is legally defined by a massive river. Like all natural rivers it changes width and borders often. So as much as we like to think of the border as being a clearly defined line. That line actually changes! The only way to fix this is to build a massive canal to control the flow like they did with the LA river. Only at a scale hundreds of times bigger! This part alone would take decades! A physical wall as Trump has promised is a ridiculous idea!\n\nForget the \"wall.\" The issue here isn't the wall it's illegal entry. The smart solution is multi-tiered. \n\n First - fix the immigration system legally. We need the workers they need the work. Make a special visa program that lets them in with certain conditions. Also, address the massive legal catch 22 with the current immigrants. A path to citizenship seems excessive to me, especially for someone who technically did something illegal. But there should be a path to something! \n\n2) You must work with the governments of the countries where the immigrants are coming from! If their own people don't fix things the issue will never end!\n\n3) Invest in a tech wall! Digital means are cheaper than ever and computers could do a lot of the work. A grid of satellites, drones, cameras, airplanes, etc. Would actually be cheaper, provide better jobs, actually create a deterrent. Not to mention that an electronic wall will have a much lower impact on the environment , be able to \"move\" with the river and likely create a more effective deterrent!\n\nAll this typing is mute...because I know a physical wall will never happen anyway...it's just a talking point to rile up dummies...",

It’s a huge waste of taxpayers money, because it simply does not work! Statistically most of illegal immigration came here through visa and overstayed their visa. 2. I think it would be much better adding more technology and more agents instead of building a physical barrier, which in terms could bring political tension between the two countries. In fact many republicans would agree with me in these point of views. They have stated their views before. Also we have to think back and ask ourselves why are they leaving their country’s? Is it the violence, corruption, civil wars? So then the question is should the USA help these fragile counties which in the long term would reduce migration. Instead of per say help the Middle East which is no where near our country. In that would be a better argument then that of building a wall.",

This world is going to shit and instead of spending the time forgiving,helping and expanding our minds in a positive way ; we spend our last bit of air fighting. I do agree that people are overcrowding but to hear someone say that the major issue is that \"these people \" (mainly mexicans) that are overcrowding america is the real issue is disturbing. Yes sure it is true and sadly these things we so call \"countrys\" that are all different to eachother is what is separating humanity apart. The real issue is overpopulation . Sadly we cant stop that from happening. The only way to stop this from getting worse is probably a war so that would be the only real reason any country would declare war on another. There are just so many things that are happening and they are all linked to eachother. Either everyone finds common ground to agree on or we all go down.",

    "commentText": "Tbh, I shouldn't really care about this issue cause I live in Europe but I like discussing stuff, it improves my decisionmaking so... here goes nothing:\n\nI agree that a country including the USA ofc should control its borders. And I also think that illegal immigrants are more likely to become criminals so you should keep the rate of illegal criminals down. However, I do not think that building a wall is an efficient solution to the problem. It costs too much for too small of a benefit. Let me explain:\n\n-The wall would have to be 2000 miles long, through rough terrain like mountains, rivers and even villages which would result in the most expensive project America has ever had.\n- > The CNBC (oct. 2015) estimated that this would cost between 15 billion and 25 billion dolllars.\n-Now add the cost of staffing and maintaining the wall that every tax payer would have to pay on top of that and we see that such huge investment really needs to fulfill its duty properly to be worth it. \n\nBut controlling immigration is very difficult and is not as intuitive as one might think. \n-It's estimated that 27%-40% of all immigrants came in on planes and overstayed their visas. So the wall will not stop a significant amount of immigrants at all. \n->Politifact (sept. 8 2015)\n-Even if we talk about the rest (73%-60%) many of these come in legally as well to visit familiy, because of business, vacation etc. And yeah, a tourist doesn't pay for healthcare in America, he doesn't pay taxes, he doesn't pay for things a normal American citizen has to. And normally these people go back. It's like this in every other 1st world country. However, if you introduce higher border control and it becomes more difficult to cross the border many people just end up staying in the USA because they think it's just better for them in the end as they can abuse the system or maybe even just have a higher life standard than before. You can think about supervising these people or maybe take measures that don't allow the abuse of the system but this has nothing to do with the wall. A wall doesn't stop people who already came in. \nThis is what happened during the Reagen, Bush and Clinton administration. The number of undocumented immigrants rose up by 248% after border controls went up significantly. \n-In fact one of 30 illegal immigrants in the USA is an unauthorized immigrant who went over the border undocumented which is less than 4%.\n->Pew Research Center 2014\n-And even if you still think that a wall would be worth it at this point we still do not know the efficiency of the wall against people who want to cross it illegally. How many could sneak by? It doesn't matter what kind of wall is built, there are easy solutions to overcome a physical wall. Now regard the fact that it's 2000 miles long and you would need to guard it at every point to minimize leaks. Desperate people will find a way. Even in Berlin before 1989 people got thorugh and that was a much, MUCH shorter wall with much higher security measures and very drastic guards shooting every illegal emigrant right away.\n\nSo all in all we would stop a minuscule amount from coming in but instead even keep potentially over 200% of the normal immigrants in to become illegal. \nAt this point I have to say that this idea is just plain unrealistic and wishful thinking. I mean building a wall was the solution in the middle ages or even antiquity to protect cities. The wall in China that so happens to inspire Trump so much wasn't even that effective at that time and we're talking about organised attacks by mongols and other people back then who didn't try to sneak in but openly  invaded China. \nThe biggest problem the USA has imo is that its system can be easily abused, that control and supervision of immigrants is terrible and that you find a job, living space and so on in America without documented background or maybe without even people giving a crap about your background.  \n\nI support everyone who wants to control the border of his/her country but I think we need a better solution than a huge wall.  \n\nP.S.: I know there is a video where Steven tries to debunk Adam. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_VDQVs7OE8\nBut I think most points Adam made are valid whereas Steven's argument debunks some data or some missconceptions but still not the main points Adam mentions in his video. You still have to see the decision of building a wall for itself and evaluate its worth given the facts that we know. And even after what Steven said, even if true and I believe him, thinking all over I still say that a wall is a terrible idea.",

    "commentText": "Don't get me wrong, I am a fan, but everytime that they don't change your mind they lose or so it feels that way, but at the same time if you don't change their mind then you lose so it's even-steven. I love the different ideas but a lot of what I heard from Crowder today is not accurate or stereotypically outdated. You can't always set parameters on someone when you are asking them to change your mind. There was absolutely no success on this topic on changing my mind episode or anyone's mind. I do have a slight problem with your word usage, you used the word border, singular, not borders and when you did use the word borders the focus was on the Mexican-American border. That is not the only border in America you have the Canadian-American border as well including with Alaska and if you really want your agenda fulfilled, not reality, then you have to build all borders everywhere you have them whether they are land or sea if you want to be genuine with your first proposal. That means the Alaskan-Russian ocean/sea border and create a ring of a border around Hawaii and if it is not a state then let it go just like Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. America has always used gimmicks to gain property and money. The So-called Louisiana Purchase and not stealing land from Mexico, but getting a Valentine's gift from Mexico with California, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico etc., Becuase America would never steal or lie about history trust me. And if you say with all due respect I can read between the lines well guess what so can I. Congrats on your success, this is not hate at all, this is a respectful tribute to the style and format you present in your discussions. Let go of the Virgin Islands since they are not a state and including Puerto Rico, if you are serious about building the wall,... they are not states. And if any country similar to Russia was in the location of Canada you would have lost Alaska a long time ago. If it is not next to the so-called nation than you will lose it. Every European country lost theirs including England, Spain, and Portugal, example losing all the new western developing countries due to selfish Conquistadors who were looking to hit the Lotto. Britain lost India, and America when the king got greedy with taxes and that is not the end of  the list, I believe Japan and China were attempted by England by trying to take over Hong Kong. You might say this is long for you and I definitely agree on the lazy eye reader but as much as I still enjoy your videos then you can't complain about the the time you spend reading this because I don't complain about how much time I spend on your videos. I truly enjoy them. But you do know that North America, especially America, wants to replicate the currency just like in Europe with the Euro and they want to call it the Amero. Once a currency- bank makes bank, other banks will follow. Where there is war there is crime and America one of the youngest countries about a bit over 200 years old has been in more wars per timeline from inception than any other country since their birth, probably more than any other country, and the recent wars are not even near the country they are gimmicks to sell weapons and America is the biggest exporter of weapons and America wants to play the blame game and play innocent and point the finger to other smaller countries except for China and Russia cus they know they will be in big trouble if they do. And when was the last time they won a war honestly, the revolution does not count it was not America it was a bunch of colonies still, they prolong wars and then lose them on purpose to promote weapon sales, the Great Britain 2.0 strategy. Why pick on the small guy if you're so great. If you are great then be great on your own. As soon as illegal or legal immigrants stop integrating to America then America will become poor and bankrupt and a country smelling blood is going to take the first bite. America does not give unless they take more, in the long run. Like taking illegal immigrants and giving them jobs based on greedy employers, that are citizens who never get punished, they should fine them at the same time you deport illegals shouldn't they, the law already exist for the fine to be applied but they never apply it, I believe the fine is $10,000 per illegal-employee. If your so-called wall is a legal defense to defend your so-called country then follow the law and prosecute those breaking the law because those who knowingly hire and even if they wanna play dumb, then good cus ignorance of the law is no excuse, right? Building a wall is a demolition-self-destructing-status just like the suicidal-card shuffle game America played with the twin towers, at everyone's expense except the so-called elite. It's all about profits and image. If you wanna stop illegal immigration right just like you say, then STOP hiring non-citizens, including any outsourcing and then keep calling yourself the best when you see your profits and Wall Street dewindle like a shriveled penis or an old breast from the queen of England, no more excitement for you America and no more bragging rights not that they ever existed. There is no such thing as legal-Americans anyways. Calling a Native American legal is pathetic, how can you go to someones home for the first time from another land crossing an entire ocean and call then legal in their own house he'll laugh at you but since they are the small guy well I guess just give them reservations and casinos and about $25,000 from guilt when they turn 18. And you where never legal anyways, all decendants fron Europe on stolen land. Besides legal is an illusion to control your mind and make you a slave. If you are human than you are an Earthling and that's all that matters. Borders will be history again and so will multiple languages since both were created to separate people anyways. Divide and conquer, is it not the strategy and game?",

But if they are still doing it today and every day for the last twenty years then Yes. Just because they got away with it twenty years ago doe's not mean they win have the right to get away with it everyday. The crime does not end the day they come in, every second after that they are still committing a crime. Being a criminal is a life lifestyle choice, not a race. You can pick your lifestyle you can not pick your race.\"\nThe next line they always come up with is how hard working illegal immigrants are. To which I say \"So what? Some crime is hard work, not all crime is easy. But it's easy than not being a criminal or people would not be criminals. Do you know whats a harder than being a illegal immigrant? Being a legal immigrant. If it was easier there would be no illegal immigrant. Legal immigrants are the number one group where a large percentage hate illegal immigrants, after all, if you had to work hard, how would you like people who got the same reward for no work?.\"\nOf course they never say illegal immigrants it's always some thing like undocumented guest worker, which I find odd. A guest is some one who is invited, and at the end of that invitation leaves. A guess has no right to tell me how to live my life, and can not get me to change it to be like the place they were so much of a hurry to leave, then want me to pay for it.\nBreaking into a country doesn’t make you any more a member of that country, than breaking into a house makes you a member of the family.",

If the problem is that the illegal immigrants statistically kill more people than legal, we have to understand why they migrate, since this is an economic phenomenal one of the ideas that I've heard from some scholars in Mexico and USA is cut the illegal selling of weapons from USA to Mexico, so we can manage the narcotrafic problem we have here. Now speaking of South America immigrants this topic is aloooooot more complicated because of the extreme poverty and ungovernability of those countries (yeah, worst than Mexico), one of the ideas of the next Mexican administration is to reinforce the economic activity in those countries so they won't have the necessity of migrate. View from a basic and pragmatic perspective the wall sounds good, but once you see the topic from a \"public policy\" & \"economic\" perspective, is not that good and you guys (Americans) will pay for it from your taxes, and is alot of mone, money you can use in other issues.",

So now, you have that wall, well, next problem: the US are the biggest consumer of illegal drugs in the world. You guys have a really huge problem with drugs. Thousands die every year because of overdose, so who provides all your consumers with heroin, meth etc? Yeah! The cartels haha and guess what? American  arms industry profits a loooooooot from selling weapons to the cartels. Ah and also the cartels bribe many of your officers and politicians. So how much do you think drugs and arms business is worth? So let me tell you something: the wall is just a demagogic speech. Who of you really think your problems with your southern neighbours are going to end with the wall? Are you really so naiv? Hope not, because your politicians and business men love money, and drugs and weapons are very profitable. Or may I remind you what happen with the HSBC case a couple years ago? Do you even remember or know something about that? HSBC is still operating in the US, a bank that launders cartels money.\n\nSo well, I understand you want to end the problem, but... well, how do I put it... your problems are much more complex than that you know. The wall is at best a palliative measure. Besides, think about this: it's highly convenient for your country to have a strong Mexican neighbour, why? Because if Mexicans feel safe and happy in their country they won't seek to flee to the US to find a better life. So you see? Your problems are much more complex than you think. You should adress right now two of them: the astonishing amount of drug addicts and the greediness of your businessman and politicians. Oh, another recommendation: pay attention with what Trump does, specially when it comes to trading matters. He's doing it the wrong way. Remember: in these new times of geopolitics there is only two options; either the US, China and Russia rule the world... or there'll be trouble, serious trouble. Be critical.",

The cost of building a wall and then enforcing patrols, the power required to run spotlights etc would be  a waste of US tax payers hard earned money. Regardless of this, the length of the border is large enough in itself, therefore it will obviously take time to build, something that could quite simply be suspended by a new party when they come into office, therefore wasting the tax payers money again. I also don't see how a wall prevents people from digging. It wouldn't surprise me if drug trafficking continued through underground networks and into the country. \nObviously it is not much help pointing out the problems without a valid solution.\nI propose building a line of motion sensors a few feet underground and guard posts spaced at reasonable distances apart from one another. A simple fence with barbed wire along the border, with the sensors underneath, would significantly reduce the cost and time to build, maintain and monitor the wall. If someone were to cut the fence, it would be cheap to fix, if someone then climbs through or underneath, the motion sensors would go off, alerting the guard posts to the location.\nI seriously think this is a more logical and economical approach to reducing illegal immigration into the US.",

As soon as an illegal immigrant - who didn't use the \"scanner gate\" or \"X-Ray boarder\" and thus does not possess an ID (or time-limited token!) will be treated like a visitor, and if they don't have a visa they land in jail (not long-term prison, because that would just prolong the problem, not fix it) and get deported if they don't have the funds to leave the country again themselves. Sounds very logical and easier to implement than an army of boarder guards that needs to be payed enough. If you underpay boarder guards you will get corruption and then illegal immigrants will have extra freedom because everybody thinks they're safe from them now. If you implement scanner gates you still have the chance of hackers helping illegal immigrants to get in of course, but those will be way fewer than with corrupt boarder guards. EDIT after thinking a bit about it: a digital ID will also cause legal citizens to go through the same procedure regularly to update their ID (or token) for it to stay authenticated, so there might be then a roughly same amount of costs and effort as an army of boarder guards.",

However, I would suggest that you do check some of the facts you are sharing (especially in this video.  2 things you promote as pieces of your defense that are factually incorrect:\n1\nHere's a study done in Texas: https://www.cato.org/publications/immigration-research-policy-brief/criminal-immigrants-texas-illegal-immigrant\nAcross the board illegal immigrants caused less crimes than native persons.  On some of the statistics, much less.\nHere's another study by Oxford's CCJ: http://criminology.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264079.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264079-e-93\n\nIn general, you need to think about the motivation of a person that is in this country illegally.  The last thing they want to do is draw attention to themselves as they know that will resort in deportation.\n\n2\nhttps://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/630906211790102528?lang=en\nhttps://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1009071403918864385?lang=en\nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1008696508697513985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1008696508697513985&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2Fpolicy-and-politics%2F2018%2F6%2F18%2F17474600%2Ftrump-tweet-crime-germany\nSooo many times Trump has said that illegal immigrants cause crime...",

If approved then they can renew their work visa so it’ll be more like a membership that keeps them here . And if they end up not paying then we can send them back. It’ll be very easy to locate because we’ll have an updated portfolio on almost every aspect of what they are doing here such as addresses, jobs and clubs that they have joined. Also we can implement a bunch of different laws for them that are just a little more strict than citizen laws.

I believe immigrants should adapt to the country's culture and values and CONTRIBUTE. A wall may keep some illegal immigrants out, but it may not be cost effective and yes, a little silly. However, it would work and it would make a lot of jobs for a while too I guess! I just don't think a wall is the best answer when their already existing immigration policies need to either be A) more strict or B) more in line with what americans would actually value for bringing in citizens. Because yes, it is a burden to make room for more people, and they HAVE to pull their weight!

You should try it and get your feelings about your supposed socialist upbringing off your shoulders. Really consider the financial burden building a $20 billion wall would be on our economy, especially with our national debt being so high. Also, consider that most illegal immigrants over stay their visas. So how does building a wall fix that?

Second point is theres actually allready walls built in alot of places with problems of illegals... Guess what they do.... They climb over or under it anyways.... The problem that needs to be solved is our immgration services. More american citzens get deported then actual illegals(research it) third point.

I really hope he does this topic again and gets an intelligent conversation with maybe an illegal immigrant turned citizen because I think a lot of people overlook a large part of the story such as what led people to make a really very dangerous deadly journey across the border. Also the difficult of getting into the country legally. I think ultimately if we want to end the magnitude at which immigration is at we have to improve the situation these people deal with in their home country because if you take away the motive I think that illegal immigration would really see a drop. As for the crime immigrants commit I think that’s where we really need to focus our efforts in. I feel like instead of stopping immigration full force weeding out the bad ones would be more beneficial and effective though I don’t know exactly what that would look like.\n\n\nAlso just realized I’m probably not against some type of border just not that full blown concrete walls because America’s rich but not that rich.",

There is also \"dreamers\" ppl who arnt citizens but work hard at school and want to have a successful life. But what Trump is doing is closing their doors he's limiting their apportunities and thats where all the anger and disagreement comes from. And since he still making laws why not make a fair one such as if you are an immigrant but you have not commited a crime u can become a citizen.

This is obviously a guy who's really skilled at debate trying to push a republican agenda. The story is just too republican to be true. \"I'm from Canada and I came to America for a better life\". Get the fuck out of here with that garbage. Canada has its problems, but no Canadian is going to claim America is better. Also, just about everyone he interviews is a complete and total moron. He doesn't show debates against people who have half a brain (And I'm sure some have sat down with him). To make it even more stupid, when people agree with them, he uses his debate skills to make them look great. This is a not so subtle ploy to get idiots to vote red. I've been a republican leaning moderate my whole life and I'm watching the republican party pander to idiots more and more. This kind of crap is what I'm talking about.",

Now, I do understand the deportation of criminal illegals, that’s simple. Don’t come here illegally and do illegal things or you get the boot. But for those that are actively working and contributing to the countries GDP, I think they should be given an outlet to where obtaining a citizenship could be easier. \n\nIn college I had a my foreign policy professor hand out standard United States citizenship test booklets and though many of the questions in there are easy for any truly patriotic person, I definitely believe there are questions within that booklet that most Americans would struggle with. I say do a survey large enough to determine what the average American knows and get those questions off of the test. I’m aware there are other factors regarding getting a citizenship but I think making the test more realistic is a step in the right direction.",

Your figure is based on a report the original author has since tried to correct but now its been repeated so much it's assumed to be fact.  Most importantly, the percentage was based on the sum of all homicides between 2005 - 2008, but was divided by only the homicides from 2008, naturally this inflates the statistic tremendously.\n\nmore info:  https://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/2015/12/04/problems-with-gao-illegal-alien-crime-stats/",

    "commentText": "A wall would work with decreasing illegal immigration but it wouldn't work for stopping criminals bringing in drugs. They'll just find more ways to go around the wall thus making the purpose of the wall pointless costing billions of tax payer dollars.\n\nImmigration, especially on our southern is a mess as the legal process to become a citizen takes to damn long (months to years) Even for the refugee asylum seekers it can take a few months. You have to think why do people come here illegally? It's because our system is so slow and so bureaucratic that these people can't wait to come here legally for fear of their lives in their own country. Many of these people live in terrible conditions that most Americans can't fathom where the fear of being killed by drug cartels is real. If you were in their shoes what would you do? If you had a family that was constantly stuck in the crossfire of warring gangs and thugs would you risk you're life and the lives of your kids by waiting months to years trying to legally come to America or would you take the risk of coming here illegally? The option most go with is the second because there's a less likely chance of them dying trying to come here illegally.\n\nI'm all for legal immigration but the process must be more streamlined and simpler then what it is. These people want to come to our country, and most are hard working, family oriented, and Christian. They want to be apart of this awesome country that guarantees them rights that many other countries do not, which is the same reason my ancestors and many other people's ancestors came her over 100 years ago.\n\nYou may say that there's violent and crazy individuals who want to immigrate here. To that I say those people are in the vast minority and you cannot punish those who wish to genuinely come here and make their lives better due to the actions of a few. Just like you can't punish law abiding firearm owners by restricting their gun rights due to the actions of a few crazy individuals. You may also say that they will take advantage of welfare and government assistance. The same goes for this as well, for you can't punish the hard working immigrant for the actions of the lazy one.\n\nWould this completely get rid of illegal immigration, probably not but a quicker and easier path to legally come to the US might lower the amount of illegal immigrants.",

    "commentText": "One thing I love about history is that it speaks volume to truth and it separates hypocrisy. Here is my reason why America is a country of hypocrisy, a banner of deception and lies. Until this day it is a a emperialism to its core. The United States manifested a world wide control based on fear, democracy spreading while pillaging weaker powers globally. 1776 it became an independent nation making it 241 years old. You call yourself America forgetting it is a continent. European Americans you systematically deprived people of their land. Dannie is Canadian  a common wealth of the British Empire,  he has the privilege to have been born in Canada now living in the US I suppose, you are lucky you weren't born in a country that isn't festering with crime, hunger, and a systematically corrupt government that sells out to the wants of richer neighbors. Countries that were bled dry by your forefathers. Applying your foot on the weak and applying pressure to the neck now you want to build a wall. You colonized and immigrated with no repercussion. There were no mighty Armies to kick you out when you stole land. You went to war  and stole resource by the sword who the fuck held you people responsible. There was no mighty UN. You don't want them when they arrive legally nor when they arrive illegally.  For 284 years prior to 1776 when the US was just colonies. Your ancestors came by the thousands thundering into land already owned no statistics then of the hundreds killed because Europeans wanted nothing to do with Monarchies after centuries you people got tired of fighting each other got tired of getting taxed up the ass .  You sailed into the new world was their a barricade holding you back, customs maybe homeland security or ice on boats in the middle of the Atlantic . The Mexicans did not build a wall when America went into their land and settled  into California, New Mexico, Texas, Nevada, Arizona so save me the hypocrisy. The US is a land of immigrants. The land notably belongs to tribes of native America not you five dollar Indians that paid for the mantle which is all colonizers of  British or mainland European descent. Talking about I'm American your ancestry goes back 525 years. Have you not noticed that besides Canada and the US the further south including the carribean Islands you go geographaly the more brown and dark people you fucking encounter. The carribean Islands are lands that after thousands of years separated from North and South America. White Americans will never change. The only immigrants in the America's are the 521 years of your existence on the continent. If your going to spill your filthy rhetoric of building a wall to keep out Mexicans understand that genetically and geographaly their ancestors in the America's go further than fucking 521 years. You colonized Africa now you want to keep Africans out of Europe Hypocrisy. You made institutional racism in all land on continents you colonized from Guam to the Philippines, Hawaii to Puerto Rico, you have shamed them for their differences Hypocrisy. You enslaved blacks speaking of all men are created equal built a nation around democracy and free will while demonizing the existence of a people, you supposedly gave them freedom only to benefit from it with institutionalized prison and racism to hypocrisy. You are not so different from your  ancestors you have not changed. If God exist he will deal your cards once you leave this earth. You have committed atrocities against your neighbor. You and your ancestors have brought pain and anguish to millions world wide. Until this day you still pillage for wealth in the middle east not democracy braided in lies. It's easy to forgive past actions, but when you constantly demonize those seeking a better life you are the nail that must be removed. 521 years causing destruction 241 as a nation built on hypocrisy and lies but let's make America the continent great again which entails 525 years ago. I have no hate for you colonizers it's not in my nature to hate humans. I do hate your hypocritical nature, I do despise the lies you tell yourselves. The hate you spill. You have your neo counterparts screaming go back to Africa to unsuspecting Americans of African descent go back to your land, I would have hoped native Americans yelled go back to Europe. Your hypocrisy has no depth no volume it cannot surpass you shame South Africans for what they do now when you did it to the multitude from the America's to Asia. To make it even worse you even terrorize your own. I reiterate I do not hate you colonizers I despise your hypocrisy, your hate, your lies most of all its the  disparaging aura of the world surrounding your own. It would be a big mistake for the world to think America is a pro people moving forward, America is a failed state, America and its greatness is hindered by its hypocrisy. All nations that cannot recognize its people diversity shall crumble in its footprint and never rise. America the free the just, America the great is but a fairytale for blind adults. It is a religion at best that revolves around the most intimate of corrupt ideas that it is any different from imperial or a dynasty like the iron curtain put up by the USSR that is what the US has offered the America's.",

Or what if you dig a tunnel?\n\nIf you want to do something about the drugs problem though, maybe lower the demand for drugs by having more social welfare programs, increased job security, etc. so that people are more likely to not end up on the streets where the only refuge they have for their failed American dream is to escape reality into the world of drugs.\n\nI believe this is why soft drugs can be legally used in my country (The Netherlands) without any problems.",

Ask China how well the Great Wall of China did against invasions ... no difference at all whatsoever and it's the world's largest wall. US Customs and Immigration has seen more than 95% of all human trafficking and drugs are coming in through boats, not the border. Also, most illegal immigrants come in through flights and overstay their visa. Humanity has made a habit of tearing down walls, including Reagan. Walls have never, on either side of the political divide, been popular or effective. Bush started one WITH Obama's approval (as he was one of the Democrats that voted yes on that bill). Obama was still taking Americans to court to confiscate their land to build the wall, which is costing tax payers too much money and farmers are losing their businesses over this. Bill Clinton also instituted Operation Gatekeeper, which restricted the passage of illegal immigrants to San Diego from Tijuana. The program increased the number of border patrol agents in the area and built miles of new fence (yes, another Democrat voted to build a wall along the Mexican border). Time and again, both Republicans and Democrats have tried fences and walls and NOTHING worked. It's time for immigration reform, just not a wall which is going to cost a lot of money, create a lot of hostility and accomplish absolutely nothing but higher taxes to pay for this damned thing.",

A wall is just a expensive prop used to try and deter people determined to find a way in no matter what.  Second, I would ask why Steven (and Conservatives) are not pushing for a wall on the Canadian border.  Why just protect the southern side?  If you're going to build a wall, why not along every border that is up against another country?",

Unfortunately that's as far as my opinion goes due to the fact that this country has the right to allow in who they want. I wish it would be handled more ethically but I wouldn't say the government has to open their walls because it's their right. I can't blame them for wanting to exclusively allow in those who will add to the economy.🤷🏽‍♀️",

If this has never happened even once then I'm sure people can see the inherent problem with this entire series.  He is incredibly well researched and prepared in his arguments, but you can't give an MMA fighter credit for going 200-0 against amateurs they pull in off the street.  I love his arguments and my opinion is changed to agree with his every time - but I also see the subjects he debates with being completely unprepared.  I'd be very interested if someone could direct me to an episode where he changed his mind, or if someone could direct me to any debates he had with a similarly prepared counter-arguer.  If neither of those things have ever happened, maybe the next step for him would be to do just that - to arrange for debates with actual scholars or politicians versed in the counter-point.",

Even in the process on to becoming a citizen makes you leave this country for even 10 years, and like in my case my father would have to leave the country which he doesn't want to do, but he's the one maintaining my house hold. My mother wouldn't be able to do it alone. But building a wall that you want another country to pay for is ridiculous.

We don't need a wall, we need military action. LOL  The problem with building a wall is that its, first, economically irresponsible.  The border should be protected and well regulated.  Don't get me wrong.  However, the amount of money, materials, contracting, planning, and continuity of border patrol operations during the process along with protecting the wall, is simply irrational to consider.  Some terrains would be next to impossible to build a wall upon.  Honestly, if we worked with these countries like Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and others, to help expedite the legal process of immigration, we would probably cut down on a lot of these issues.\n\nBeing a Black man, pledging unwavering allegiance to any country is a tall order for me.  Seriously, the second I find another country that suits me and my family's needs and expectations, I'll leave.  America stopped improving and rested on its laurels.  I agree that immigration needs to be a high priority, but I think it should be handled with humanity, not solely legality.",

If you look at the current immigration laws you will see that there are some ancient devices in place that really make it tough for illegals to become legal. If you are illegal and you choose to try and persue becoming a legal citizen then you are choosing to roll the dice on wether you will be allowed to stay here while you go through the legalization process or wether you are going to get hit with a 3 to 10 year ban before you are allowed to even begin the process of legalization. During those 3 to 10 years you will be in your country of origin and if you for any reason choose to come back before your ban has been lifted, the ban is reset. Come back one day early without permission? Spend another 3 to 10 years enjoying being away from your family and loved ones. I have one more year left on my mother's ban before i'm allowed to request her Visa and another two years for my father's.  They paid taxes, owned a home and raised three Christian children who pay taxes and contribute positively to Society. My sister is going to school to be a nurse and my brother just passed his Police Academy Entrance Exams. If I believed that the wall was going to  make it easier to change the current Immigration laws then I'd say build the wall. But the truth is the only thing that is going to reform those laws are people understanding them in their current state and understanding why there is a need for reform.",

Really easy..\n\n1) If you are trying to get into america because \"The united states opportunists and government is better\" that is the REASON for us to liberate Mexico and make it ALL the USA..\n\n2) if you are coming into america because \"We need asylum from our government\" GREAT! we should put up our flag in your country, put down a military station set for defense, and then liberate your country.\n\n3) If you are coming into america because you want to invade the free world and cripple our government.. Then you're government needs to be reigned and let know that this is the same as war..

Illegal immigrants are just that - illegal. If that results in a dad being separated from his kids, well that's no different than a guy who robs a convenience store and goes to prison, therefore missing out on his kids growing up. Stop calling it \"undocumented immigrants\" like it's a clerical error.\n\n\"But he just wanted to be here to make a better life for his kids. How is that a crime?\" Wanting to do that isn't a crime. Finding an illegal way to do it is a crime. Laws and emotions are completely separate things, and emotions have no business dictating law. Law is meant to be impartial while emotions are 100% partial. If they want to make a better life for their kids, then work hard for it like those of us who are parents here have to. Keep a clean record and come here legally. There will be opportunity.\n\nAmericans are PRO immigration. Innovation and competition come from immigration.

From the videos I've seen, you base your beliefs in logic, yet you can't see that the \"wall\" is no more than a symbol used to incite an inflammatory effect. The notion of a physical wall symbolizes safety and protection. Houses have walls for shelter the same way a castle has outer walls to keep away intruders. Well, to a person inside those walls, the provider of the walls (in this case, Trump, as it was a move on behalf of his presidential campaign) is viewed as a provider of protection and safety. However, it does demonize all people trying to immigrate legally or illegally. A better use for not only the funds that would be necessary to build a physical wall but the energy it incites in people with heavy preconceptions would be a more effective immigration infrastructure. Sadly, something that necessary is also immensely complicated and doesn't sound so sexy in a hate-chant. It just doesn't sell as well  as \"Build that Wall!\"",

    "commentText": "I believe many people migrate to the United States from other countries illegally because of the poverty from there native countries or the harsh living conditions they might be having to face in there countries. For example lots of people pro building the wall like to target Mexican people. But in reality they are not the only illegal immigrants in the US. And many people argue that Mexicans bring a lot of drugs into the US. But if we actually look at the history of drug smugglers. Peru and Columbia were really the ones making mass amounts of drug money. And they were smuggling the drugs by plane, boats and other forms of trafficking. So how much will building a wall really protect the smuggling of drugs if that wasn’t even there preferred choice of drug smuggling? Also before when weed was considered an illegal drug that people would get convicted many years in jail for selling. Which now is taxable and is being legalized through out the US. This makes me question whether the US can claim anything to be legalized as long as they can make money of the product. Such as weed or cigarettes or alcohol. We all know all those things are also bad for your health and are addicting but as long as Uncle Sam gets his cut it can be legalized. But back to the original point is considering why are there so many illegal immigrants? And it all goes back to the same thing. Everyone regardless of where you are from believe in the American Dream. And they come to this country in hopes of having a new begging and prospering for there family. And many immigrants do try to legalize there status here in the US are denied by the thousands and thousands every year. Being an illegal immigrant in this country brings obstacles that they have to deal with everyday that a legalized person will not face. So many the real problem is not the illegal immigrants but the standards that are set in place as to who qualifies to be legalized. Perhaps if they allowed more people the opportunity to be legalized in the US as the second guy mentioned the US could profit of the work they already are taking here and have them pay taxes and have more opportunities for the illegal immigrants as well. Another factor is a lot of illegal immigrants are also in fear of being denied and then deported back to there country and being ripped apart from there family here in the US. Many people in other countries are so poor that even there parents force them into prostitution as children like in China for example. Other people are scared to be killed by Narcos like in Mexico. Other people are scared of dictators like in Cuba. The reality is that the majority of people that come to this country come in hopes of a new life. And America was founded on immigrants. When Christopher Columbus found the Americans he paved the path for European exploration. When Europeans came to this country and killed all the Native Americans and the ones they didn’t kill they rapped. They didn’t come here with permission from the Native Americans. They didn’t get a visa or a green card. They too came as illegal immigrants. The truth is unless you are Native American someone in your ancestry came here as an illegal immigrant at some point and because of them you can know live a better life with more rights than in many other countries.",

If you didn't build a wall, you could invest that money into supporting mexican anti-cartell efforts. Maybe you could invest in outreach programs in mexico, try and offer mexican youth better jobs in mexico. There's a big trade war going on with china, maybe you could build factories in mexico to produce the same crap china did?",

The cost of a wall the likes of which Trump or his ilk boast they will build would be astronomical, and still would likely not be effective. The most likely scenario is billions of taxpayers dollars sunk into a partially completed construction zone along the border. Anyone thinking a foreign country is going to pay for the wall is just simply delusional. \n\nI am not for open borders. I am not for illegal immigration. I am not even a liberal.

I believe there should definitely be some kind of immigration reform, I think that while the wall sounds logical it could cause more problems than it would fix, namely it’s extraordinarily expensive, we have border fences/walls in place already that are a deterrent, and the actual physical border doesn’t match property lines (so a wall would go through American citizen’s property). I’m not sure what the best solution is, but asking an ally to fund a wall after making some racist remarks (“they’re bringing drugs, they’re rapists”) about them I feel is what made this discussion so controversial and why people are harassing you (not that I condone it). I think if we really want to deter illegal immigrants then we have to crack down on employers hiring illegal immigrants for extremely low wages. That might be more expensive for American citizens but so is building this wall and we can either have people here legally or we have to accept illegal people here if we want low wage labor.",

And even before building it, the US would have to make sure it lives up to any laws concerning nature. \nAnd if it is built, then there is maintenance and staff costs too...\n\nA wall might make a difference, but is it affordable?\n\nI understand why they want a wall. Go for it. I’m not American, so I couldn’t possibly understand the issues 100%, but I find it very “interesting” that there are such an amount of illegal immigrants in the US. I highly doubt that would happen in the UK or Denmark or Germany...",

And I hope we can all agree that our future goal should be to make this world a better place for us all and stick together.  Let's take your data. Most immigrants are male young adults.  So the biggest group of people committing crime. I don't need to tell what happens to young adults with no perspective, immigration or job. I think there is so much potential in good education for man who want something out of life and so less value in keeping them away.",

There is a statistic and I don’t remember the exact numbers but according to the statistic a majority of illegal immigrants come her legally with a work visa but then it expires and they stay in America or they come by plane which would fly right over the wall rendering it useless. The wall would work a bit but it would be super expensive and not worth the cost. I don’t know how to completely fix this issue but a cheaper solution I feel would be to make it easier to became a legal citizen of the United States. As of right now it can take years to decades to become a legal citizen which cost a lot in legal fees and expenses. If they made a way that cost little to none and takes no more than a few months to a year to complete we will have a big decrease in illegal immigrants without spending lots of US tax dollars on a wall.",

Also the bureau of statistics cites that crime across the nation has went down, but illegal immigration has went up. To top it all of I believe Brookings Institute cites a study that says illegal immigrants lower crime by 33%. I love your videos Crowder!!!

If the wall is built, it costs a ridiculous amount of money for something that doesn't even solve the problem on it's own - people will still get in. And - because its a 1,000 mile stretch of concrete infrastructure, the upkeep will cost an increasing cost in millions as time goes on, along with the cost of surveillance that Trump also planned to give to this 1,000 mile concrete wall with armed guards. Also, according to the department of homeland security, 70% of illegal immigrants come through on work/temporary visas and simply don't leave, most illegal immigrants aren't the border hopping stereotypes that you would assume.\n\nHell, Trump himself said that someone could get over it with a rope and ladder the very FIRST time he brought it up at one of his rallies.\n\nThe problem people should have with the wall isn't some sort of political correctness stance, it's the fact that from an economic standpoint it doesn't solve the problem proportionately to the cost of building and maintaining it.

    "commentText": "The wall is an incredibly stupid idea from the economic, diplomatic, and practicality standpoints. That being said, I am for securing our borders, but using a different tactic. From an economic standpoint, the wall is a massive expense. Not only is it estimated over $25 billion to produce, but maintenance would be a nightmare. Furthermore, the wall acts as a symbol whether we like it or not. It could cause heavy diplomatic tensions, not only with Mexico, but with other countries who witness our country undertaking such a massive project simply to block out another country. Even with checkpoints and gates, walls are never a good diplomatic solution. Finally, the wall will not be effective. Majority of illegal immigrants actually make it over by plane and simply overstay their visas. The illegals that do cross the border are innovative and organized. A simple standing structure will not stop them. \nI feel as though a better option would be to outsmart their ingenuity and use technology to secure our borders in a more efficient and effective way. This can be done in many ways. The hardest part about securing the border, is actually being able to know when someone has crossed over illegally. This is obviously a serious technical challenge for our engineers. In densely populated areas along the border, this can be especially tricky. A wall may be more effective in these areas, but it is common practice for illegals to dig tunnels under the border anyway. These are extremely hard to detect and often lead to buildings in the US making them even harder to find. The most effective way to deal with illegal immigration would most likely have to come from reforming our documentation standards. While the US keeps good records, IDs and documentation can still be easily faked. furthermore, a more effective documentation system can prevent illegals from taking advantage of our social benefits, such as free healthcare, food stamps, unemployment, etc. If we simply upgraded our systems to be more difficult to fool and increased funding for border patrol, we could be much more effective in deportation of illegals. \nThis problem lies in our cultural values as well. With the left using pro-illegal immigration rhetoric, our community has become more ignorant of the damage that illegals cause on a day to day basis. This means that a majority of our community will refuse to report illegals. A well funded interest group with a well though out marketing campaign could help swing the misinformed population. This is not so much a policy issue as it is a cultural one. If our community could stand up against those who take advantage of our social benefits, this issue could be heavily mitigated.",

The drugs that are produced and sowed in Mexico are consumed by the USA, so it's a two side problem. If you want to stop violence and drug trafficking then stop fucking buying drugs because this business relationship is also affecting Mexico, it makes carteles stronger and stronger, increasing violence mostly in Mexico plus it has been found that the guns that carteles use are made in USA!  Build the wall, educate people so they stop buiying drugs and supporting narcotrafficking, and regulate immigration policies (because I'm sure there's also bad mexicans going into the united states) but don't make it so hard for the hardworking, educated people to go in.",

Who is going to pay for it? What effect will it have on an already suffering Mexico? Don't you think that it will cost less to screen them and have them come over legally than to \"Build a Wall\" and man that wall 24/7. How deep do you plan to build this wall??? 1 mile deep??... because we all know about the tunnels from mexico to the USA. I have 100 more questions of course but I will post them after i get a response to this one. Curious as to the answers I get for those questions i just asked.",

Italy started to reject humanitarian vessels that pick up immigrants from the sea after they leave Lybia. So...I don't know... for me it's amazing to see this agenda in US against borders and americans who think no borders is the best solution to this problem. I live in an east-european former communist country and I reject the idea of being monitored and checked where I am, where I go, what I say on the phone and all that, but.. still... at least some form of border control is needed because there are some bad people out there..",

My point of view and i hope i change your mind by telling you that i can agree with you that you should clearly enforce the border, but the reason i personally think the wall shouldn't be built is because it is a symbol of hostile separation between to countries (neighbors by the way) that care for each other and help each other economically. With that said, the wall could create a line between to countries that care for each other and have the same principles. In conclusion i think you shouldn't build a wall but instead enforce the police and security in and near the border. Let's build bridges not walls. \n\nYours faithfully Santiago",

So just tag or GIVE A FREE GREEN CARD to the people who are sneaking in and here illegally an just make them legal but still make the people who want to come here legally from other country's go through all of the immigration laws. What do you think they will do Hmmmm????? ( I WOULD GO TO MEXICO AND SNEAK IN FOR A FREE TAG!!!!!). You also have to funnel them through to check points to tag them or in essence GIVE THEM A FREE GREEN CARD (TAG!) you idiot. As far as the ones that are already here. You will only be able to GIVE FREE GREEN CARDS to the one's that are caught and/or come forward to be tagged. I sure wouldn't want to be tagged and pay taxes they seam to do pretty well untagged. I like how he says tagged like an animal as well  yet we are the racists ones. Isn't that what a green card is a fucking tag or number in essence any how? The ones already here should be deported first an for most because they are breaking the law in the first place. If you are punished for a stupid traffic violation. Why shouldn't they be punished for breaking a very serious law in the first place!!!!! That was the stupidest shit I have ever heard. So in essence a digital scanning WALLLLLL that scans them as they pass through to become legal citizens and AQUIRE FREE GREEN CARDS boom just like that no checking them out to see who or what kind of person they are. Also if they don't have a tag be for coming across how can they be scanned.We will be in the same boat trying to catch and round up 100 times as many people now as they scramble across. Which brings us back to funneling them through check points and building some sort of WALL!!! We might as well just call it all America rather than north and south America but I don't think we are ready to manage south Americas problems at the moment. No one says we don't want them here. We just want them here legally and documented like the rest of us!!!

They have to deport illegal immigrants that are not willing to contribute to the society and that are against order, not that legal immigrants and citizens are an example of active members of society, most of the time they are just as bad as the criminal that we are trying to deport or put in jail.\nThe wall, not only is financially impossible is very unlikely to be ever finished, maintain and well guarded, we have to be realistic about this. Sure the wall would bring a sense of security, but would it? \nMajority of the illegal immigrants come as legal tourists and then decide to extant their stay, therefore becoming illegal visitors. How is the wall going to stop tourists from becoming illegal immigrants?\nAccording to the https://travel.trade.gov/view/m-2017-I-001/index.asp In 2017, for the first nine months of 2017, we had approximately 55 million visitors, legal visitors, in the country. I ask again, how the wall is going to stop them?\nIt’s easy to criticize, yell and insult these people, but, if you have not experienced or follow what happens on a day-to-day base you should research what really. \nWe do need an immigration reform and figure it out a way to help the people that are in the country, but the wall is not the answer.",

People are leaving countries like Honduras for example, one of the most violent countries in the world, so their children can grow up in America and have more opportunities growing up. Again, I don't think people should be coming here illegally, but the process of immigration should be refined. It takes years to immigrate to America and really only a small amount make it.

The main concern I have with a wall is the interfering with the movements of plant seeds and land animals.\n\n   I would recommend a \"virtual wall\", you put up bright orange concrete pylons with in visible range of each other along the border with an inscription that says in English and spanish \"These mark the U.S.A.-Mexican border. It is ILLEGAL to cross here! If you would like to enter the U.S.A., the nearest border crossing is located at [location]. Behind that you can bury a wire (or a grid of wires) that give off an magnetic field and hall sensors that can detect changes to that field whenever something moves near it. With a little tweaking it should be able to detect the differences between a human, a vehicle, a deer etc. and if it detect a human it could alert drones to go and document and human border patrol if needed.",

I think we should secure our borders sure, but people can still take planes here. Boats too. Is trump gonna build a wall on the coast of the Florida keys or anywhere in south Florida? It’s where I live and I’ve seen many immigrants come to our shores on boats, from Haiti, Cuba, etc. and trumps got a house where they’re landing (mar a lago). Most of these people just want better lives. They’re hard working people. Goto any restaurant and you’ll see all the dish washers are Haitian. Very nice people and they will cook the most amazing food. Trump doesn’t understand this. He comes down here in south Florida every winter and sits in his gold plated mansion. While across the bridge there’s some bad ghetto where these immigrants live. Trumps never worked a day in his life, he’s had a silver spoon since he was born.

If you make the immigration process simple and acceptable for everybody, since we're all humans that have the right to live wherever we are and shouldn't be judged (as humans) based on our race or belief, we shouldn't be judged according to where we were born too. Plus the fact that when you ban something, it becomes more likely to be wanted so when you do not make traveling between borders hard, people won't risk their lives to do it as much as when you prohibit it. If I have the right to travel anywhere like Americans or Europeans, I won't be eager to think that I should illegally immigrate and risk my life and my family's life to do that, since it became a choice, so I will be happy to apply for a residence permit and be legal if I need to live in another country and perhaps regarding the tax issue, if people are below a certain income, then perhaps they don't need to pay taxes (since most of the illegal immigrants are working in the lowest paying jobs anyways) they are just under the radar. So as a conclusion, I see there should be no discrimination against any other nation's people based on where were they born, since that cause them to either stay poor in their own country or be illegal immigrants if their status doesn't allow them to fit within the current eligible candidates. Second, there should be acceptance by all countries that whoever wants to travel anywhere, he should be granted that according to the law, he should follow the law of the hosting country, should be legal resident, should follow easy procedures like the ones Europeans have between their borders, just travel with their ID, no need for a passport even, but the Passport is not the issue here of course. Third, people should treat others as normal human beings, I don't mind people coming to my country politely working with me and making money, they are not stealing me and treating me like shit and they take all the goods like the occupation of the US to most of the countries of the old occupation of countries to one another, no, just workig side by side as normal human beings, then I won't feel imprisoned in my country if I needed to leave or if I see that America or Australia fits my preferences and my life goals, there shouldn't be nationalism anymore and the idea that we as Egyptians are the owners of this piece of land so we control everyone else, and we Americans are the best in the world and anyone else coming to us is going to take our goods and should be treated like shit and we English are the uniques of the earth and no one should take our jobs, all of the nationalism is bullshit. Build a wall like old historic cities to provide easy residence and work permits if you want or make laser beams, that doesn't matter, most importantly is how to unite all as one again and let everyone who wants to immigrate and complete his or her life elsewhere actually able to do that.",

    "commentText": "I'm not for the wall or against it cause I can see the positives as well as negatives towards doing this. It's to stop or slow down immigrant's coming into America but let's be real here, even building a wall wont stop this. My whole view about illegal immigrants is that I don't mind about honest people wanting to have a better life as well as to get away from dangerous situations. I'm not ok with bad guy immigrant's coming here and causing American citizens issues or hurting the American people. The only thing that upsets me about immigration is that they feel entitled to get everything an American citizen gets and demand they get these privileges even though they aren't citizens. No offense but I dont wanna have to pay for someone to come over here especially when they demand that we do. They have no right to demand anything from the American government what so ever. The point to be a citizen is to prosper and help your fellow American be successful and succeed in life. But for someone that came here illegally and tell me I have to cater to their want's is crap and if you pay taxes then you should agree. There are right ways to do this to get citizenship as well as help from the government by doing it the right way. But for someone to sneak in and tell us that we have to pay for them to get free food, housing, school, medical is down right crazy. That's like some stranger coming into your house and demanding you that you have to feed that person and their family. as well as them telling you that you will treat them like how you treat your family. Wouldn't go over so well. See if someone wants to sneak here and then fine, but dont come over asking for a free hand out and start attacking Americans for not doing what you want. Just like 5 month's ago in DC when they tried protesting to the government but the government wouldn't give them anytime cause they're not citizens. So what did they do? Caused damage and attacked American's physically and verbally for not getting their way. Which alot of people were arrested and deported cause of that. My main point here is that you only get government funding and help if you're a citizen. If someone wants to cheat the system and jump the line while others doing it the right way get screwed over then whatever. But don't demand or expect us to pay your way just cause you see what we have and get for being born here. You want the same right's then fine, go back to y'alls countries and get it. Dont hurt us cause you dont get your way js. That's my opinion was all.",

Of course what would make more sense is to excessively fine the farms, slaughter houses, kitchens, etc that draw illegal immigration in the first place. If there is no money to be made then it would make sense that the appeal of sneaking across the border would become much less desirable. \n\nThe problem is that this would only end up destroying the bottom line for these businesses who depend on cheap, exploitable labor in turn would harm the wealthy, faux patriot business owners and shareholders who have bought and paid for the Republican party long ago. So these men of industry came up with a symbolic gesture in the form of a chant using only monosyllabic words ie \"Build That Wall\" and outlined plans for oversimplified solution the average Trump supporter can conceptualize. The various government contracts for the jobs will then go to Trump supporting contractors (see Whitefish Energy as an example) who will see an immediate return on their corrupt and traitorous fealty by massively overcharging the taxpayers while claiming Mexico will just reimburse us later (Spoiler: they won't). Want to start a trade war with Mexico to pay for it? Sure, but just remember that when the tariffs go up and the cost of basic materials triples that your average confused/angry Trump supporter will probably just find someone else to blame. \n\nThis debate was a farce.

Gave me tin foil hat vibes. \"Gather the masterminds!\"\n\nI'm personally against the wall, and I wouldn't say stricter or more lenient immigration laws, but ones that become more lenient for those who would pose less of a threat, and stricter for those who have criminal background or we can't really know.\n\nI like the idea of a sponsorship program, where mexicans (or someone from any country) can be sponsored by a US citizen that has not committed a felony in their lifetime, nor broken the law within the last 10 years, after the mexican immigrant-to-be has visited the country on 3 separate occasions, so as to prevent some catfishing of US citizens type deal. This of course being limited to a certain number of times (prolly just 1) per citizen. Or granting citizenship to those who have come in on a work visa three times without committing any crimes.\n\nDude has a point about taxing, but your concern is valid. I'm personally for (across the board, not just for immigrants) declining tax-funded programs to people who are not contributing to the tax pool, or have a person in the household paying taxes, other than employment programs (so they at least get a chance to contribute).\n\nMaking it easier for the workers and people our citizens care about on an individual basis to get into the country by extension narrows down the pool of questionable mexican citizens, therefore making them easier to sort through individually.",

I got a great idea to fix the issue.\n1. make the majority of people here legal with green cards and on the path to being citizens. Yes they do fill some jobs that many dont want to do. Except when major violent crime is committed they should have that revoked.\n2. Make it so a company can be fined for having undocumented immigrants working there. Same as what Great Britain does.\n3. Build the dam wall and give the border patrol better equipment like drones to watch it.\n4. Use some of the tunnel detection equipment that Israel uses to find tunnels and destroy them. Israel knows how to build walls.\n\nAll this would allow a secured border but still be fair to enter legally. Having an unsecured border allows easy access to drugs and terrorism into our nation. There was a leaked document a few years ago about Al-Quida. They wanted to sent people to Mexico and they cross into the US; as it is easier than getting onto a plane to the US. Also the cartels in Mexico are as violent as ISIS sometimes and honestly should be combated harder with military force when needed. Sorry if this sounds hard to some. But America is for America first. We cant take care of us while trying to take care of everyone else to.",

The two need to be separated as no matter where you stand on immigration or any of the underlying issues (sanctuary cities, visa lotteries, travel bans, acceptance of refugees, etc.), a critical analysis of the wall can only conclude that it is a project that takes up far too much resources and time for the very little in security that we would get in return.  \n\nIf you say \"I'm for the wall!'\" as a way of saying \"I am for tougher enforcement of current immigration laws, newer and more restrictive laws for legal immigration and better security at the border,\" then you have reasonable positions with which other reasonable people can agree or disagree, especially in the details.  This is where the immigration debate can be constructive.  But, if you say \"I'm for the wall!\" as a way of saying \"we need a continuous structure along our border with Mexico,\" then you're just a moron.",

We don't have the budget to have adequate amount of school supplies in our classrooms, and somehow we can just procure the materials, labor, and time to build a 2000 mile wall? What is conservative about that? Much of the land there is private property. Is the government going to seize it in the name of eminent domain? That seems like it would be the biggest abuse of government power since the internment camps, and goes highly against the right's stance of small government. \n\nWalls have been notoriously poor throughout history at keeping people out. From Genghis Khan breaching the Great Wall of China multiple times at different points, to the nazis completely bypassing the Maginot Line, to the thousands of east Germans crossing the Berlin Wall, to the thousands of north koreans getting through the DMZ every year, and that's just off the top of my head. A project of this magnitude and cost better stop all illegal entry coming in from Mexico but you'd be foolish to think it would. Also, don't a large chunk of illegal immigrants do so by plane?",

Second point is people are going to get in anyways the wall is just a stupid and another dumb Trump idea with no good justification what so ever. And last but not least the wall would take AGES years and years to be built and the united states government right now should try and find a solution for the money problem right now.

This means they aren't paying taxes and are nearly untraceable if they commit a crime.\n\nStart with those that are dealing in drugs and stealing; feeding the Mexican pipeline of drugs to this country's youth. \n\nLater, make a thorough sweep for other illegals still here.\n\nIf the child was born here, let them make the decision to stay or go to Mexico. \nIf the child is not old enough to decide whether they want to stay in the U.S. they and their parents will have to move back to Mexico and apply for citizenship. \n\nThis gives the parents time to apply for citizenship here, gain some money for the move back, and make sure their children are stable. \n\nThis will also deter those who really do not care to stay in the US.\n\nWe have to have humanity and we see a whole other country adoring ours because we are the land of the free. \n\nIf these people want in, let them in accordingly. \n\nYou might have the next Einstein coming in our gates!

Not a solution for the U.S because of their ego and due to the fact that these illegal imigrants participate in the economy. Working off radar or not, they cost less than what they bring. It would be shameful to  result into building such a huge wall. Like the lady said, they will still find ways to get in. We in Europe have the Mediteranian Sea as 'our wall'. It does not stop people arriving in hundreds and thousands into the E.U illegaly.  Those willing to go onto such dreadful and risky journeys to cross the boarder are truely doing so for a good reason. They are Human Beings fleeing poor living conditions in hopes of making their lives better. They are not crazy to go through such risks. Unfortunately the sad truth is that we 'where the grass is 'greener'', fear the consequences of sharing such a priviledged lifetyle with foreigners. Most Europeans (and I assume U.S citizens) fear due to employment/taxes at risk with too many migrants. Whats the worst that can happen? Degrade from owning a BMW to a Corola. Having 50$/€ less to spend on stupid things per month, whilst people on the otherside struggle for their lives. Not knowing when they will get killed by their Government(Africa), neighbouring gang(Honduras/Mexico), malnutrition/sickness and fear of spending the rest of their years without hope if they stay where they are.  Hope is one thing we should never take away from people, and it is our duty as 'better-off' nations to help provide hospitality for those seeking assylum/refuge instead of treating them like criminals and animals. Put yourself in their shoes and put down your burger and step down from your clouds for just a minute.Its important to secure a boarder ( even though schengen is doing fine) but it is another to split a continent physically.

Back then, I was a diehard SJW who made a presentation about the refugee wave, which was obviously not rooted in facts and 100% based on emotions. At least I got a round of applause from my equally airheaded friends (yes, I’m calling myself airheaded bc I was.)).) \n\nLiterally, go up to anybody in Stockholm and say “I think our country has a problem with illegal immigrants because of all the proven statistics that point towards illegal immigration being tied with (violent) crimes and rape/sexual assault” and there’s an 80% chance you’ll be decked in the face and called a racist (Or, in my case, you’ll have ‘“B-B...UT YOU’RE AN IMMIGRANT SINCE YOURE CHINESE” said to you...which just goes to show that these Swedish sheep know nothing about immigration, be it legal or illegal) OR a supporter of Sverigedemokraterna (the most Conservative party here, their leader is awfully annoying but I agree with his stance on immigration, whoopsies.). \n\nBut go up to somebody and say “I identify as a ceiling fan” and you’ll be called progressive instead of a fucking retard. \n\nSweden is a beautiful country, but I hate living in it sometimes when I see how overrun it is with crazy feminists, illegal alien worshippers and other deluded alt left idiots.

I sometimes want to scream when I hear privileged, zie/zir identifying knucklefuckers whine about how oppressive America is, like no.).\n\nHelp.\n\n(Sorry for the longass comment, I just feel like nobody talks about Sweden and paints all of us Swedes as retarded liberals, and I’m pretty tired of it.)\n\nEDIT: I’m a 19 year old girl and a Chinese immigrant (whose parents worked hard to grant me a Swedish citizenship when coming here) for y’all knucklefuckers planning on @ing me with your ‘str8 whyte male™️’ bullshit.",

Mexican here, I want you read my comment keeping in mind that I am Mexican, not Mexican-American, meaning that I am not watching this video from within the fake-victim-culture that you have in America.\n\nI agree with this video, immigration brings bad people into good places. If mexicans, middle-easterns, puerto ricans and other citizens of the world had a culture rich in values such as justice, peace, and being civilized overall, they would´t have the need of leaving their home country in the first place.\n\nBut I don´t think that building a wall is really going to help, I do agree that having a more controlled border, implementing regulations and preventing immigration at all is needed, but how is a wall going to help if (as a lot of people have already said it) around half of the immigrants come by air? Still the other half comes by land but as quirky criminals as we are, we are going to find other ways of migrating without going through that wall. Basically I think that regulating borders is really important, I just think that a wall is not going to stop us.\n\nAnd by the way, really good strategy there from Trump, separating kids from their families, blaming it on democrats, then he makes sure it never happens again with an executive order that makes it easier and faster to get the whole family deported to avoid them being separated. Smart move, create a fake problem and fix it passing whichever law you want.",

    "commentText": "Hi Steven!  Hopefully my argument will have you consider, not necessarily a change, but the efficacy of the wall.  The wall itself is a physical construct that will waste resources that can be used elsewhere.  I would say instead of looking at the problem as to how do we stop the flow of illegal immigration from Mexico to the US, or rather illegal immigration via Mexico into the United States; the questions we should ask are: #1 Why are people willing to leave this place (Mexico, or where ever they are originally from) to go to that place (the US)?  #2 Why isn't their illegal immigration problem going the other direction or rather a diaspora/exodus from the US to Mexico (or anywhere else on the planet)?  If you look at Mexico, it should be a prosperous and safe country.  They have a representative democracy similar to the US, so at the very least it is not a tyrannical, totalitarian or communist regime.  It has a diverse landscape and dynamic natural resources like the United States, in other words they aren't a 1 trick pony like say Kuwait.  The reality is that even with all these natural and political resources, Mexico is a dangerous and corrupt country.  Instead of the wall, if we were able to work with Mexicans on improving those 2 problem areas, Mexico could become safer and less corrupt country, which should result in a more desirable place to eek out an existence.  If that happens, the wall would be rendered as useless as the German Wall.  To simplify things, the US is rich; Mexico is Poor.  The US is not too corrupt, Mexico is a cesspool of corruption.  The US is safer than Mexico.  Everything needs to reach an equilibrium, including rich vs poor; safe vs unsafe; rampant corruption vs not as corrupt  While a wall MAY reduce that force of equilibrium, it's not going to solve it.  Drugs and human trafficking are far too alluring a score to complete in the US and the cartels that operate them have far too many resources to be stopped by a stupid wall.  As long as their is money to be made, they are going to find away in.  It may take longer, they have to go over, they may have to go under, they may have to go around, but, in the end, they are going to find a way in!  Our best course of action, give them (notice my use of non binary gender pronouns - aren't you proud of me?)  a reason not to leave.",

You can have whatever stance you want on illegal immigration but to say they commit 37% of all homicides is America is just stupendously wrong. All the hispanic gangbangers, you know all the cholos who shoot and kill people are all hispanic Americans. They commit a lot of homicide. If Over 50% of homicides are done by blacks, than to your understanding 37% of all homicides are done by undocumented migrants? So what that just means 13% of homicides are done by all whites, all immigrants, all latinos, all Native Americans, and all Asians? like what? Somehow a fruit picker commits 37% of all homicide while all the cholo hispanic gang organizations in America (which are overwhelmingly Americans who are Latino) commit virtually no homicides? Think about it, all those hispanic delinquents in California, texas, New Mexico who shoot and kill are all Mexican Americans. sorry but again that statistic just sounds incredibly retarded when you look at the population of these people and this and that and just logic in general.",

    "commentText": "Just so all you people know New Mexico is a state in the U.S. and no its not part of Mexico. It has been a state since 1912. The guy in the white shirt politics are complete shit, but he is right about having Spanish blood. He is what you call a mestizo which is a term traditionally used in Spain, that originally referred a person of combined European and Native American descent, regardless of where the person was born. Northern New Mexicans are a hyrbid mix of Spanish, Puebloan, and Navajos. The Hispanics in Northern New Mexico are not Mexicans, history and DNA even proves it. Research about the history of New Mexico and look up the Crypto Jews of New Mexico that came from Spain during the Spanish Inquisition and settled all over present day New Mexico. During those times there were literally thousands of them. The Spaniards who colonized Northern New Mexico intermarried with Pueblo and Navajo Indians which is why he has that skin color. Santa Fe, New Mexico was for generations the northernmost seat of rule for \"Nueva España\" -- which translate to the New Kingdom of Spain. He is right about him having Spanish blood, is he full blooded Spanish? No, he is part. How do I know all this because I was born and raised in New Mexico and me and my family are mestizo ourselves. We are the Hispanos of Nuevo Mexico. Also I even took a coarse in college on the history of New Mexico at UNM so I have a great deal of knowing what I'm talking about on this subject. Here so you non-New Mexicans can get some education on my state and my people.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puebloans\n\"Pueblo communities are located in the present-day states of New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas, mostly along the Rio Grande and Colorado rivers and their tributaries\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexican_Spanish\n\"is a variant of Spanish spoken in the United States, primarily in the northern part of the state of New Mexico and the southern part of the state of Colorado by the Hispanos of New Mexico\".\n\n\"Speakers of New Mexican Spanish are mainly descendants of Spanish colonists who arrived in New Mexico in the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries\".\n\n\"In the meantime, some Spanish colonists coexisted with and intermarried with Puebloan peoples and Navajos.\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanos_of_New_Mexico\n\"For most of its modern history, New Mexico existed on the periphery of the Spanish empire from 1598 until 1821\".\n\n\"Due to the Comanche, contact with the rest of Spanish America was limited, and New Mexican Spanish developed closer trading links with the Comanche than the rest of New Spain. In the meantime, some Spanish colonists coexisted with and intermarried with Puebloan peoples and Navajos, enemies of the Comanche. New Mexicans of all ethnicities were commonly enslaved by the Comanche and Apache of Apacheria, while Native New Mexicans were commonly enslaved and adopted Spanish language and culture\".\n\n\"In Spanish, the predominant term for this ethnic group has always been hispano, analogous to californio and tejano. In New Mexico, the Spanish-speaking population (of colonial descent) was always proportionally greater than those of California and Texas. The term is commonly used to differentiate those who settled the area early, around 1598 to 1848. It can also refer to anyone of \"Spanish or Indo-Hispanic descent native to the American Southwest.\"\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Pueblo-Nations-Centuries-Indian-History/dp/0940666073\nOne of the books we read when I was in college. Which shows the interaction between the Puebloans and the Spanish conquest in New Mexico.",

That is why we have different border control methods, like officers, helicopters, cars, detectors, etc. If you waste billions on a wall, it will be harder to cross the border, however it will still be crossed. He makes the mistake of equating border control and the wall. There are definitely more effective technologies for securing the border. Which would be harder for you, getting over / under a wall, or escaping a helicopter or jeep? Secondly, the issue is not to secure our borders, it's to figure out why people want to come here, and to resolve the issue. Criminals come to earn money off drugs, so we need to do better about reducing drug demand in the US. As long as there is strong demand, criminals will meet the supply. As for the illegal immigrants who come for a better life and opportunity, they deserve a faster, easier process to a green card. It takes years waiting for a visa, which is rediculous if you're on the run from a gang or going hungry without a job. Do you think illegal immigrants enjoy crossing the border? They do it out of desperation. They deserve to have an easy process for legality, so they can come and work. Unemployment is at record lows and companies are struggling to find honest workers. Workers are the backbone of the economy. The fundamental difference between Republicans and Democrats on this issue, is that Republicans want to keep Mexicans out and Democrats want to bring them in. Framing them as criminals or Innocents, and all the other arguments are just used to support one or the other side. I want to let them in because I believe they do more good than harm to us, and as a human I don't want to be complicit in another Human's suffering.",

If implemented carefully, this could make it nigh impossible for black markets to circumvent the system because any goods coming in would need to be tracked by the government.\n\nSo, yeah, it could work.  If we're willing to give over all most of our civil rights to a frighteningly powerful police state.\n\nWhat was that guy's name again?  I want to vote for anyone other than him.",

Here is how I will try to change your mind:\nI personally care very deeply about the social aspect of the issue of immigration.  However, I understand that this is not the case for many people so I will start by explaining why building a wall does not make sense economically.  The wall will cost about 20 billion dollars (I got this information from cbs but it is very well known).  Many of the illegal immigrants coming into this country actually come here legally on a plane and then overstay their visa.  In this case, the wall would be useless.  Instead, I think the money should be used to create a better and faster vetting process at the border.  We already have people stationed at the boarder.  Security could always be increases again with the $20 billion.  I do agree that we should know who is coming into the country.  However, there are many people coming here to simply provide for their families.  It should be easier for them to come into the country and seek sometimes seek refuge from gang violence and other abuse.  These people will help our economy and the vetting system will allow us to quickly send criminals away.  \nDiving into the social aspect, PEOPLE ARE ALL PEOPLE, HUMANS ARE ALL HUMANS.  MY LIFE DOES NOT HOLD MORE VALUE THAN AN IMMIGRANT SIMPLY BECAUSE I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE BORN IN THE US.  Therefore, we need to have sympathy for people who are just coming here so they can survive.  Furthermore, the wall is a symbol of hatred and isolationism.  The US is a leader of the world.  We cannot be isolationists and nationalists.  We must bring people together and be accepting of those that need help and are different.  What will this wall say about our country to the rest of the world?  Lastly, everyone besides native americans and african americans (as they were forced to come here unwillingly) are immigrants.  We all just need to love each other!",

    "commentText": "Ok, let's break it down:\n\nThe person's claim:\n\"When it comes to crime there's like.. maybe a small percentage that brings drugs\"\n\nCrowder then claims that Trump didn't say that. Finally he admits that Trump's quote was \"worded poorly.\" Here's the quote:\n\n\"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\"\n\nNext Crowder gives the guy statistics on immigrants, but admits that his statistics aren't of Mexican immigrants specifically. For this reason, they are largely irrelevant. We're talking about Mexican immigrants here so don't bring up statistics that involve non-Mexican immigrants.\n\nHere's are the reasons the wall is a ridiculously stupid idea:\n1. Undocumented immigration has been in decline for 10 years.\n2. More unauthorized Mexican immigrants are returning to Mexico than coming into the U.S.\n3. Mexicans make up only half of the undocumented immigrants. So the wall is an extremely expensive attempt at solving only half of a (declining) problem.\n4. A vast majority of undocumented immigrants are here due to overstaying visas. The wall would only potentially stop the flow of a minority group of undocumented Mexican people come from. This means the wall would be an extremely expensive attempt at addressing a minority portion of only half of problem that is shrinking anyway.\n5. If the undocumented immigrants are to be addressed, there are more effective, less costly, less politically divisive solutions (such as addressing overstayed visas). But this is should only be in discussion after a very thorough cost/benefit analysis.",

That being said, I have enjoyed, now two of your change my mind youtube videos and have subscribed to your channel.\n\nSomething that rubbed my wrong were your statistics in this video, here they are countered: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/have-undocumented-killed-63000-us-9-11/ (there are many counters to your claims that can be found online)\n\nThat being said, which sources are correct? That would just go back and forth. The problem I have is that you state your stats as fact, and they are disputable.\n\nIt also seems that you prefer to air the more emotionally charged liberals in the crowd. I could be wrong as I am not there, but at a minimum you come to the table with more content preparation than the people you pull off the street. That makes it very easy to prove the hidden point to your content, that your mind is correct and can not be changed (my assumption, which you could dispute in a conversation.)\n\nOn this topic: There is no real argument here, the US has always been building walls where needed across our southern border, and left open space where the wall does not make sense. The real argument is how dehumanizing the president and those that have followed him on this topic are.\n\nAnother point is it's cost. There are many other things in this country that the money to build the wall could go towards. Better roads, better education, in some cases better strategies to reduce illegal immigration. \"The Wall\" is just an ego boost for our president.\n\nWe should not be at war with this issue. There are many vulnerable people involved. Many, if not most, may be crossing our border illegally for a better life. They have no other realistic option to get here and chase the American dream. These peoples only crime is the location of their birth. They want to work, they want their children to get an education, they want their children to become successful professionals. Why would we want to push back on that? We need to put our energy in embracing it and finding a ways to legalize it, not demonize it.\n\nFYI I am a Bernie Sanders fan! I argue politics with my family every chance I get, we do have Trump supporters and every level of involvement in those discussions. I am also a teacher and my students always feel safe claiming whatever political view they have in my classroom, in fact I am telling one of my conservative students about this channel today, he will love it. I just want to keep them thinking.\n\nI doubt either of us will change the others mind :-) and you will probably not even read this with so many comments. If you do I would love to try to change your mind some day. Until them I will watch some more of your videos.\n\n-Erik",

Only if we are angels will either scenario work.  A border of surveillance is more pragmatic as our technology continues to develop.  The ability to scan people suggests an implant and one not easily removed.  A scary thought and unconstitutional I think.  I agree with the young man that what we need is both security and freedom- quite a paradox but not contradictory.  Historically first generation immigrants can be more of a burden to their adopted society but their children and grandchildren become that society- to the point that they no longer speak their mother tongue.\nIv'e often thought that's a shame as language is such a potent cultural conveyor.  So it's ironic that I left Miami in part for that very reason long after I watched the \"white flight\" of 95% of my neighbors.  I took Spanish lessons and three years of it in school but refused to learn it though I didn't realize.  If I am a drink I would say I'm milk and the Cubans are orange juice. Add a drop occasionally to the milk and I still have milk.  But too much and the milk curdles.  Finally there is no milk-only tangy orange juice.  A law was being proposed that a basic English test must be passed to obtain a drivers license.  I did not agree with it at the time as I knew English was not necessary to be a responsible driver.  But that wasn't what it's about.  Some feel it's our just reward that the \"White Man\" is loosing his grip.  We don't need a wall with 1st world Canada but 3rd world Mexico?  Whatever future transitions occur I dearly hope we can be reasonable and heed  cool heads who intelligently articulate instead of hot heads full of reaction and insults.  Society is like a chemical reaction- too much heat and it becomes unstable.  I know it's not perfect but let's not throw out the baby with the bath water.",

The Great Wall of China didn't stop the Mongols from invading, just slowed them down a bit. The wall in Israel didn't stop suicide bombers from coming in underground, it just slowed them down a bit. So it's going to be very expensive to build something that isn't going to do much of anything. But it's bad for the environment and animal migration. Majority of illegals coming in here are honest and want to work. It's the bad guys who make them look bad, yet they'll have sources to get around the wall better than peaceful people. They'll likely profit as coyotes by charging the peaceful people. And the American police will likely get bribed by them sort of like during the alcohol prohibition. There will most likely be an underground pass built. And who is going to be running it? The cartels. The bad guys. See how this isn't a solution for honest people to attempt to do things legally, but an instigation for illegal profits.\n\nAs someone who is against abortion, I find it ironic you're in favor of this Wall. You're a smart man, but some of your stance on issues are ridiculous and hypocritical.",

He's incredibly misinformed and seems to pick only the stupidest people he can find because he knows his point is so weak. I'm not going to comment on the laws surrounding immigration, but the actual physical wall is the worst way to stop illegal immigration. If you're looking at preventing drugs or illegal immigrants entering the country, don't build a wall. Upwards of 80-85% of drugs enter the United States through air or sea, and most illegal immigrants come here legally, but just over-stay their visa, neither of which the wall would prevent. The wall will be billions and billions of dollars wasted, while not solving anything. The only thing a thirty-foot-high wall will do is create a market for 31-foot ladders!",

We don't even enforce immigration laws that exist now. First of all a tough stance on immigration needs to exist, the will needs to exist to get them out.  Here are my ideas #1 have a shoot to kill policy at the border, we'd only have to kill a few to get the message across very seriously, it'd be such a good a deterrent . Second we need to make it impossible for them to exist here, make laws which make it mandatory to prove citizenship to go to the hospital, to have a drivers license, to get any assistance whatsoever, make citizenship a law to get a job, fine employers massively for employing illegals. If you take the incentive for them to want to be here they won't come. Make living here anathema to non citizens, make state sponsored anti mexican propaganda, make policies which grant monetary rewards for people who report illegals, we can get a lot more creative and effective than a wall, i'm not wholly opposed to a wall either, but a wall alone without a serious change of sentiment and policy is almost worthless. They'll tunnel, they'll climb,  if we have a wall it needs to be really strong, high, deep into the ground, and electrified, it should be like Israel's with armed men or remotely operated or AI weapons systems and or a full time staff of soldiers with orders to shoot to kill, our immigration issue would end real quick. I'd also like to see armed round ups of the illegal aliens who are already here, put them on cattle cars and ship them the hell out.",

Imagine if those stones could’ve been used to build permanent waterways, structures and roads in Beijing. The Chinese could have had a great tourist attraction and a great contribution to the civilization.\n\nThe Berlin wall is the wall of shame in history, all but small portions totally removed, except for the pieces left standing to remind us of its stupidity as well. In the long run, the Berlin wall did nothing more than economically suppress the Soviet occupied part of Berlin, while the westernized side of Berlin prospered. Even now, 70 years later, one can see that the cordoned off portion of that great city was economically and culturally penalized through no fault of their own.\n\nNonetheless, Trump wants his own monument to waste and stupidity so he can go down in history like an ancient myopic Chinese dynasty or a failed communist empire. And all because of a lame campaign promise made to his shrinking minority base within a troubled Republican party.\n\nTrump has already made his mark on history. We already have a president with the lowest of approval ratings, who is rated dead last amongst presidents by modern historians. But that doesn’t seem to be good enough for Trump, because he wants to leave a permanent scar on the earth.\n\nBut I don’t think we need a structure carving off the Rio Grande River from the bottom of the Texas and handing it back to the Mexicans. We fought pretty hard for the land between the Nueces and the Rio Grande in the Mexican American war of 1845, which, via the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which was the culmination of one of the biggest land expansions in the history of the world. Seems pretty stupid to cut off our own access to the river that drains from Colorado and New Mexico, so that Mexico can have the sole access to those waters. Not to mention all the eminent domain confiscation of land that adjoins that boundary, devastating some of the most fertile farmland in the country.\n\nIf the stupid wall ever gets built, we will be motivated to pump out all the water before it reaches El Paso, creating a 1,000 mile long dry ditch, and creating new Sahara-like desert on both sides of the wall, visible from space. Indeed, Trump would then have made his mark, handing what’s left of a great river, along with land from our side, back to the Mexicans with a $25 billion structure that might as well have signs on their side that read: You’re Welcome!",

    "commentText": "This will change your mind. Now I havnt got the time to pull up the specific statistics however, the reason you should not build the wall is because it would make no difference. I'm pretty sure in the different ways illegal immagrints can pass the border, in the ground is the least popular way. Correct me if im wrong but immagrints that are illegal normally get across the border 'on holiday' then overstay their welcome. I'm not against stopping illegal immagrints, I'm against spending billions of dollars on something that is not going to make a difference. Like any other illegal act, people are going to find a way around it. It's fact. If you disagree with that you need to see a doctor. I think what America has in place is good enough except some very particular things that I'm not aware of but will be discovered in the future. There is so much more to say however it's late for me and would like sleep. Feel free to oppose and I will reply when I can. Many thanks and would love to do something like this in the UK it's great.",

Further more there's a general rule with defensive walls like this which is that you have to pay their full price again every 40 odd years to maintain them.\n\nIt won't stop illegal immigration; about 40-60% if illegal immigration come via plane, and it's quite silly to think that these extremely desperate people won't find away over it as soon as it's their only option. This is a nation where people build their homes, they can build a ladder and rope.\n\nIt won't stop drug trafficking; drugs are already transpired in their majority over the border fence using a catapult. Throughout history the harder you make it to transport drugs, the price higher the price goes and demand remains constant. The increase in funding results in stronger, less safe drugs, more powerfull drug cartels and I'm sure, if need be little rockets to get drugs over a wall too high to catapult.\n\n\nNot to say I have a catch all answer, but unmanned drones, frequent car patrols and more financially accessibly citizenship accusition would be a decent start.

Are non-citizens committing a disproportionate amount of crime given what a small percentage of the county they make up?

So there could be a program between countries where they can offer qualified worker for a season. The US company will be in charge of salary and safety of the worker. And the worker will abaid to the laws and taxation of the US. At the same time the country of origin of the worker will be in charge of the insurance and mobilization of the workers. In that way everyone wins. The employer gets the job done. The US Gov receive Tax and money flows in to the US economy, plus the employer nor the US gov has to carry with social security expenses. The origin country receive tax, and money flows in to the local economy and the inmigrats has the incentive to safely go to work and return to their family and culture... then again An actual wall would be as effective as a trench or razor wire or a canal full of sharks with \"lazer\" beam attached to their freaking heads without mentioning , waaay more expensive.",

Dialogue and addressing the problems in both sides of the border will secure both countries and make illegal immigration less likely to take place. Sitting down and recognizing the fact that both sides have a responsibility in this issue  and creating strategies together will do so much more than building a fence or a wall or a crocodile pit at the border.

Agents can monitor from a far and report to patrols in the area what to expect (weapons, drugs, children etc) and respond accordingly and have more information to go off of.

It's a victimless crime breaking a trivial rule we take too seriously, and when we find an \"illegal,\" our only course of action should, at most, be a fine, like a traffic ticket, until they get their documentation in order, and we should be providing them an easy, direct avenue to do so.\n\nInstead, we have a system so convoluted that even people born and raised here for decades have difficulty figuring it out or passing the citizenship exams when tested. Resources are inadequate, red tape too thick, and it's all too easy to LOSE legal status on top of it. In fact the most common \"illegal\" is someone who came here on a work visa and was stranded.\n\nIllegal immigrants still pay taxes like the rest of us if they pay for any services or get any kind of job, but they don't get the same refunds back or benefits, so they actually pay even more than we do and are already being \"punished\" enough for their \" \" \" crime \" \" \".\n\nThe image of people sneaking in to do mischief is a cartoonish stereotype that seldom applies to reality, and if they want to live here, they should only be helped along, not treated like animals.",

There will be more!  The reason is simple the world leader who ever and whatever that means, will need control! there is only one way to control, check points through walls!

I can drive to Ontario, Canada from my house in less than 10 minutes if I were unimpeded by border patrol. I could swim across easily, it's so close. But guess what? In all my 27 years I've never heard of a single issue with illegal immigration from Canada, and (other than the fact that Canada is a good place to live compared to places where these other illegals are coming from) that's because we have something separating us. It's not a wall, no, but it's almost as easy to swim over as it would be to climb a wall. It's the fact that there is SOMETHING there. We have border patrol on the lake and the river, we have customs at the bridge, these measures keep us separated. I go to Canada frequently (strip clubs are way better there) and I know Canadians who come here regularly just to go out to eat, it's very common, and because we have proper credentials and documentation, we are allowed to visit each other's country. It's literally that simple. Also if I wanted to become a legal Canadian citizen or vice versa, there are steps that could be taken to make that happen, it just has to be done legally and thoroughly.

    "commentText": "The second guy reminds me why you won't find a capitalist, more specifically corporatists complaining about illegal immigration. Because it means more money for the employer and less wages and benefits they have to give as more cheap labor comes flooding in. Considering that looser regulation and cheaper labor in other countries is the main reason for our own corporate exodus problem. Taxing illy's, (or not) on top of the flood of them in the workforce, albeit low skilled jobs, can give some benefit to the economy as it would fix or help our corporate exodus issue. Does it outweigh the amount illegals social security cost taxpayers though, or the potential compremisation of safety? Although they can only claim a small portion of social security programs compared to a US citizen. Also this lowering of wages hurts the employee which is the majority of Americans, it's a tricky situation. Also the wall is expensive, needs a lots of upkeep and is really a static defense that is more of a delay rather than a real problem solver as some people who worship the wall claim it to be. It still requires the same or less border patrol in the vicinity, but there's a huge slab of taxpayer funded concrete in the vicinity instead. Point is, the wall isn't a holy end all and is a nuclear bombing mentality apporach to solving the illegal immigration problem, expensive, lots of downsides, long lasting effects that aren't easily reversed and no guarantee of intended results. We do need better border security and better immigration logistics, I just don't think the wall is really the best solution. I would hope people don't blindly shout and worship, \"build the wall\" or everything Trump or Republicans say and propose, then they would be just as bad as their much despised leftist.",

    "commentText": "Steven, with this particular issue, I do not think a wall would be of any benefit. First of all, there is the drug issue. The drugs brought into the US is very minuscule being smuggled over the border. Most of the drugs that are being abused are opiates, and those are brought in by pharmaceuticals. To extend this further, the CIA brings in a lot more drugs into the United States than any drug smuggler. The CIA has been the king pins of drugs since their origins in 1950, when they started testing drugs for their Project Bluebird/Artichoke/MKULTRA.\n\nOn another note, the majority of illegal immigrants are immigrants that have overstayed their visa and these are people that are flying into the US. building a wall is not keeping these particular illegal immigrants out of the United States. This wall will not stop very much of the migration coming into the country at all, because of the fact that most of the immigrants are flying in, not crossing the border.\n\nFurthermore, this project is going to be taxing the hell out of US citizens since there is a lot of money involved in creating such an infrastructure. Not only are we going to be taxed for the wall, but when you look at the logistics involved with building this wall, there will be a lot of eminent domain taking place, where people will have their property taken away from them because their property just so happens to lie where they want to build this wall. This eminent domain issue was really big when the Keystone Pipeline was being built, as it completely infringed on treaties that were signed with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and the United States, and went over sacred tribal land which was just very very disrespectful. Furthermore, I don't think anyone would be very happy losing a huge chunk of their land for the sake of this infrastructure (unless they were not aware of any of the facts behind building the wall)\n\nThere are absolutely no long term benefits from my position. If anything, this suites business more than anything. I feel that this wall would serve more as a giant prison than anything, and as a statement from the Bureaucracies of \"haha! look we fooled them again, and got them to give us more money!\"",

Well here is the truth about that, when they come by air they are coming legally (using a VISA) but once their VISA runs out they don't go back. However, what they could do is while they are here on their valid VISA and if they are planning on staying here they should work towards getting their citizenship, and we should encourage them to do so (if getting the citizenship is too much money and to extreme to be able to do so in a short time (a year or 2) then we should start a discussion with Congress about making it cheaper and less harsh, this will help fix illegals by air, then tighten up security at the border (either by building a wall or hiring more Border Control Agents/Officers). That is how we help fix this issue.\n\nI'm not saying it will be 100% effective, because nothing is ever 100% effective. I'm just saying that it will help by more than you can imagine.",

Remember, the US was built by immigrants looking for a better life, so why should we deny the opportunity to thousands of hard working individuals to follow that same path to a better life?

    "commentText": "There are a few reasons to not build a border wall.\n1. It hasn't been proven that it will reduce illegal immigration. The majority of illegal immigrants did not cross the border illegally. The majority is also not from south america. The majority come here on visas and overstay them. And the majority or from China.\n2. Who owns the land that the border wall will be built on? Government? It is public land. Which means the taxpayers technically own it. With the way property rights work, multiple people can't own the same property, otherwise one will be violating the property rights of the others. If 51% of the people decide to sell it to China, the other 49% have no property right because their consent is being circumvented. We either have property rights or we don't. All property should be private.\n3. People want to put up the wall to stop illegal immigrants from coming here. Not because they are afraid of them. Because they consider them a drain on our economy due to receiving free aid from the government(food stamps, etc). But the problem isn't the immigrants, it's that there are free handouts to begin with. The government takes people's money and gives it to other people. That is also called socialism.\n4. Who will pay for the wall? I know Trump said he will make mexico pay for it, but that is just delusional. Taxpayers always pay for everything our government does. So again, a bunch of us are going to be forced to pay for something we are against. No human being has a right to force someone else to buy something they don't want. But that's exactly what government and voting achieves. Not to mention the tariffs he is imposing on foreign countries. Those countries won't end up paying for that. The cost is always passed on to the consumer. It's just sad that most people have no clue how economics work.\n\nI'm not democrat or republican. Actually i'm voluntaryist(ex libertarian). So when I criticize trump, realize that I also criticized obama, bush, clinton, bush sr, reagan... Give credit and blame where they are due instead of basing my opinions on emotion. I don't want government. I don't want anyone forcing me to do or pay for anything i don't want. I don't care if you want that. More power to ya. Just don't involve me.

Not try to block them out. You'd be surprised to see how little a wall would prevent immigrants from entering this country... They WILL find a way. It's survival instinct. As humans, we all have it.\nI'm aware that diseases, pest, and crooks are something to take into account.

Could we not send resources such as, antibiotics, vaccines, food, water, etc. to prevent diseases from crossing this imaginary line we call a \"border?\"\nWe could organize a program to help people become healthy, legal citizens. Especially now since Trump and his administration have worsened our healthcare, making the rich more rich and the poor more poor, and wants us to pay for the wall when instead we could use all the money to support the lives of our race! \nWe can grow together, not as citizens but as HUMAN BEINGS!",

Focusing on the criminal aspect is a given, but it's also easy to counter it by playing on emotional aspects. It is true the vast majority of people who are here illegally are genuinely good people who just want to provide for their families. The inconvenient truth however is that there really only are two options - Open borders or border enforcement. It's uncomfortable, sure, but there is no in between.\n\nSo 1. Whether you admit 10 immigrants per year or 10 million, there will still be millions who can't come, because you can't have restrictions on something without enforcement. Some of the most progressive countries on Earth - Norway and Denmark for example, have some of the strictest immigration policies anywhere. How do leftists come to terms with this uncomfortable fact? Half shove it under the rug and ignore it, half join the open border gang.\n\nWhich brings me to 2. No country has ever tried an open border policy. Bernie Sanders famously called it a \"koch brothers proposal.\" It would be a massive social experiment and gamble which would be more likely to crumble our infrastructure, job market and decimate poor families than anything else. Leftists generally struggle with numbers. There are over a billion impoverished people in the world who would love nothing more than to move to the United States tomorrow. How do you double, triple, even quadruple the population of a modern day country, unrestricted, without collapse? It has never been done. I have never in my life seen anyone come up with a comprehensive and realistic plan for this. Ever.\n\nEssentially - The more you force leftists to talk openly about border enforcement, they less able they are to claim any moral high road. The more you force leftists to talk openly about open borders, the more public support they lose.\n\nI'm a first generation immigrant. I'm very pro-immigration. Legal immigration.",

I am warning you ahead of time that I dictated this to my phone via Google  voice and it is probably filled with  wrong words bad grammar misspelled  things that might not make any sense I am too tired to type this out so it's up to you to fill in the blanks LOL This Spanish kid doesn't have a clue what he is suggesting he wants everybody to be biometrically shipped with an RFID identifier that will reveal all personal data all private conversations your location at all times and will even announce you before you even show up to cross through the X-ray checkpoint. That is one of the most dangerous and radical ideas I've ever heard this kid wants complete government control you want no security no privacy just completely open unfettered borders where people can go as they please without any restrictions at all there are so many issues with that I can't even know where to begin. This kid wants to live in a totalitarian police state and he thinks that everybody will agree to this absolutely not he doesn't seem to understand the difference between a physical wall and a invisible one whether you are stopped by a barrier physically blocking your path or you are stop by a technological one it's still a wall and people will always try and circumvent it people are not going to willingly submit themselves to be shipped like this to be monitored at all times we have a constitution in America and in that Constitution we have a Bill of Rights he is suggesting we burn the Constitution with his idea. This kid sounds like another brainwashed neo-marxist socialist. This kid thinks he's going to be governor of New Mexico one day? This kid sounds like he's lost one too many brain cells from all the dope he smokes I doubt any of his ramblings came from researched ideas it sounds more like his ideas come from conversation she has with his friends while they are all high. This kid thinks that we should simply legalize them arbitrarily and then just start taxing them to force them to spend their money in the United States that sounds like a very systemically oppressive law that will single out a group of people over others you cannot treat migrants and naturalized citizens differently if they're both naturalized citizens a citizen is a citizen the moment you start forcing oppressive laws like that on to people who are now citizens you are actively creating a oppressive system of government that will hold certain ethnicities down, this is the exact same thing that sjw and Liberals are always screaming. This kid is insane if he thinks that anyone would ever vote for a law like that no illegal immigrants would want to become legalized if they were now penalized for it while other people do not. He didn't even address the disproportionate amount of violent crime committed by the three percent of illegal immigrants coming to this country now you want to give them citizenship with no borders congratulations kid you just open the floodgates 2 waves upon waves of unskilled uneducated laborers who will simply jump on the system mooching off of government assistance so where's this tax money going to come from most of these illegal immigrants are on some sort of government assistance already which we are already paying for. Many people get all of their money under the table and all of their money get sent back to Mexico the money that these people make a very large majority of it does not benefit the American economy it gets sent to the Mexican economy president Trump tried to fund the wall originally under the threat of charging fines for all Western Union and MoneyGram wire transfers from America to Mexico. I just cannot believe the crap that this kid was rambling on about he has no idea what he is even saying you can't form a cohesive sentence or argument this is the typical intelligence of these indoctrinated cultural Marxists. Borders have always been a necessary and essential part of the sovereignty and safety of all countries. China had a wall to keep the Mongolians out Vatican City has a wall that separated from the rest of Italy Jerusalem has a wall Mexico's Southern border has a wall. Help your own yard has a wall surrounding it people need to protect what is there's walls dissuade people who wish to take by force. Walls keep your property and yourselves safe why was keep America safe. You want to have open borders and open immigration fine look what happened to the EU since the Syrian War began? There is widespread crime and violence all across Europe that never existed before people are being bred out of their own countries people are being displaced from their own neighborhoods you cannot have unchecked widespread immigration it is chaos and if you think that you can somehow control it via government monitoring then you're even more clueless than I thought.",

Some just do not have the money to protect it.  I love how these people think that open boarders is going to solve all the worlds issues.  Yet they say, 'let them all in.'  Yet have no idea what to do with them once they are here.  But one thing we do know, is the American tax payer pays out billions in welfare yet they pay just millions in tax.  We have an unemployment rate that is always at least 5%.  Do some math.  What is 5% of 360 million?  Of all these people that want open boarders and let em all in, yet they are not the ones growing food, creating jobs, creating housing, create energy resources, cleaning our water, providing security through police, putting drug lords , rapists, criminals and other illegals in jail and so on.  They have no solution except, let them all in.  But what they do expect is someone else to come up with the food, the housing, jobs, energy, and so on.  It is not their job, but someone else job.  Tell you what, when you become a farmer, create thousands of jobs, become a police officer, become a doctor, and so on to offer any type of solution to deal with these illegals, I promise to try and take you seriously on this issue.  Ideally it would be nice to live as a structured society.  But not every country is like that.  And those countries are like that because of the people you want to bring in here.  Fact is, there are criminals, drug lords, rapists, robbers, lazy people, dependable people, and so on.  Are you suggesting that just because there are only thousands of these people, that does not justify wanting to know which ones are here or going to be here?  Bet you would change your mind if an illegal that other wise would have been controlled through security and secure boarders killed a family member you would be the first one demanding justice.  You want to take guns away from the very few that do so called mass shootings, which make a very small percentage of gun owners, and even small percentage of legal gun owners, and you want to regulate them.  Yet a higher percentage of criminals cross our boarder, but because there way more hard workers then criminals you want to give them a pass and not find out who is the criminal?

The wall in itself will not solve the boarder issues by itself.  But it will make it harder.  There needs to be 24/7 armed boarder agents and military.  Mayors who provide sanctuary cities need to be arrested and thrown in prison.  There needs to be better education on reporting illegal aliens.  Stiffer crimes for people that employee illegals.

I’m on the fence about a physical wall right now, but I’m completely for boarder control and reducing the amount of illegal immigrants.  Just like it’s not fair to us citizens and to those who wish to be through the legal routes.  I would like to look into other countries and how they deal with citizenship.  If I as a US citizen wanted to immigrate to a country in Europe or Japan, would I have an easier time than those who want to enter the US, or would it be just as restrictive?  I think I may find that the US is not alone in this.",

As long as there are poor conditions to escape and the United States takes years to even look at the immigration applications people will come illegally. But here's another thing, with how shitty the U.S. is at legally allowing people to come, there needs to be less stigma with illegal immigrants. They are not criminals, rather the majority are hard working and willing to do hard work for little pay just for a better life for their kids. Not just that, undocumented immigrants make up a massive part of our economy. Rather than condemning them for trying to escape violence and poverty, we should be thanking them for being willing to do such hard work without complaining. The wall would cost so much not only to build but also would cost a lot to our economy in the long run in immigrant labor. The best way to deter illegal immigration is by making it easy to legally migrate. Especially because that boosts economic growth by immigrant labor considerably AND monitoring the bad guys at the border becomes much cheaper and easier since the numbers of illegal migrants drops significantly AND we save the cost of building the border on taxpayers. That doesn't solve the problem completely and it may take years  before it's effective but it's so much better than just saying \"fuck it let's build a wall\"",

    "commentText": "These sit-downs were pathetic... I mean, most people walk up to this pavillion randomly, not having prepared anything on the topic, and face off against a well-spoken pundit who HAS prepared for these talks... yeah, it's not really fair for them, and Crowder controls the editing. But still, those opinions were weak as fuck. I'll bet these people came up with better positions 5 minutes after walking away.\n\nHere's the reason the wall is stupid: it's economically inefficient, it's insulting to Mexico (our ally, for now), and it's fairly ineffective given what Trump purports that it will do.\n\n1) The wall is COSTLY. We're talking many BILLIONS. We could put all our illegal immigrants on perpetual welfare for that kind of money. It's also extremely costly to lock them up in detention centers. It costs more than many hotels. Deportation, plain and simple, is the most cost-effective way to limit and deter illegal immigration, which is why Obama was dubbed 'deporter in chief.' And Mexico will NEVER pay for the wall, anyone who believed Trump when he said that is an idiot. What would force Mexico to pay, eh? Nothing, that's what.\n\n2) It's not physically possible along the entire border. There are areas with a giant river and areas with mountains. It's not actually necessary to build walls in locations where there are natural boundaries and would be a waste of money to essentially 'double up' those defenses, which would then also need to be maintained.\n\n3) Wall prototypes are weak. Just watch Penn & Teller's episode of BULLSHIT! about Immigration, they tear the idea of a wall to shreds.... literally. And this was long before Trump. They get a few illegal Mexican workers to build a section of wall (not fence) that was proposed by the Bush Admin, and then at the end of the day tell these Mexicans they need to get over, under, and through the wall. Some tin snips, a shovel, and a blanket to cover the barbed wire were all that was needed. Took all of them less than 5 minutes to get through, regardless of the route they took. In fact, going over the wall seemed to be tougher than going under or through it. Now, you want to make that wall even more robust and impenetrable? Okay, then see Issue #1, above. Every panel, every stick, every roll of wire and every rock placed costs TAXPAYERS.\n\n4) People who live along the border, even those who voted for Trump, HATE the idea of building a wall there. Because of geographical considerations the wall would have to be moved BACK in many areas, ceding ground to Mexico and even cutting properties of American residents there in half. Some, if the proposed wall were built in some areas, would find themselves on the other side of that wall, and these are white American citizens, middle class home owners, that we're talking about. Those closest don't even want it, so that should tell you something.\n\n5) More immigrants have been leaving the US than entering it; we have been experiencing a net loss over the last decade. There is no sound premise that makes building the wall a good idea because it's addressing a problem that basically doesn't exist. It's an answer to a question no one asked.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/01/27/even-before-trump-more-mexicans-were-leaving-the-us-than-arriving/?utm_term=.68e5104113e2\n\n6) Crowder is pulling some strange numbers out there, saying that immigrants commit more crime than citizens. I want to see his source for those numbers. The studies I can find conclude the opposite, that immigrants are overall less likely to commit crimes -- and why wouldn't they? They have more to lose if caught than the average citizen.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/19/two-charts-demolish-the-notion-that-immigrants-here-illegally-commit-more-crime/?utm_term=.2da53c5b7998\n\n\nSo, in short, the wall is a stupid waste of money. That's why it should not be built. Because I'd rather have my taxes go to non-stupid things if at all possible, and I'm surprised that there are so many Trumptards out there who don't see it that way. I guess for them fear beats representative taxation.\n\nIf anyone has issues with 'left-wing' Washington Post, fine. Show me your sources that contradict them and I'll take a look. Just don't use that as an excuse to quickly conclude 'fake news' and walk away like an intellectually apathetic cuck.",

This is anecdotal stuff. \nIf I'm not mistaken the current statistic is that 66% of illegal immigrants are those who overstay their welcome on visitors visas. I can't see how any amount of screening or border wall could keep that from happening. \nAlso, some of these people are incredibly desperate. You think a wall is going to stop them or their smugglers from coming up with a way to get over it? \nI'm sincerely trying to figure out what good an actual wall would do.",

    "commentText": "3.5 % of the population but 37 percent of murders in the USA?? wht lmfao. that cant be a real statistic. That has to be skewed. And not that pointing an issue out with another race solves anything but really think of all those white collar men who pour millions into offshore accounts to avoid taxes. That's probably more than any illegal avoids in taxes. Aside from the fact that a portion of illegals that work have fake or borrowed social security numbers and pay taxes. There are still some who don't have papers or legal right to work in the USA of any kind that work under the table but also spend a majority of the money on living expenses here. So it ends up being taxed in a sense. I would love to see the numbers compared but im sure that would be hard to find an accurate statistic for both white collar tax evasion vs illegal immigrant tax loss. But yeah. that is a separate issue and I'm for enforcing the borders to a certain degree but in our current state in society it is a waste of money. I think the idea and the perception of having a strong border is more important than actually having a secure border. It is incredibly easy to cross over and relatively cheap to do so. The math will never add up. The immigrants will always spend a lot less money trying to cross over than it actually cost to prevent them to do so. The solution might not lie on the states but their native country. If you try to prevent them from crossing we will forever be in debt to a losing cause. Not worth it. Spend that money else where like education and police forces for ghetto destroyed neighborhoods. Rebuild broken cities.",

The rates per 100,000 for native citizens and illegals were 3.88 and 2.9, respectively. So from what I can tell, the data shows illegals commit crimes and homicides at a lower rate than natives.

Building a wall this scale would do nothing but cost outrageous amounts of money, and really hurt the areas it is built, both environmentally and civically. It just doesn't seem to make much sense at all. Besides historically large boarder walls have proven to be almost completley ineffective in keeping out migrants. One this scale would not complete the job any better, and I dont really see how that isnt completley obvious. \n\nBesides, net migration from Mexico is in the negative, more Mexicans are leaving the states than coming in. I feel like the issue of immagration has been really bloated by the American media in recent years. Of course we shouldn't condone illegal immagration, but we should also understand that the cartels have taken control of mexico in certain areas. Deporting poor people and putting children in internment camps isnt going to do much to change that. Rather than take the iron fist approach, which has never worked. It is my opinion that incentives should be put in place to migrate legally, the US is not an easy country to move into. Making it harder just makes more people migrate illegally. Unfortunately, immagration friendly policy will never be popular in red states.",

It knows who you are, where you've been, who your friends are, and much more personal information and it you.  Do they  only use this system to track your whereabouts?  Not even close.  All this data assigns a score to you.  That score is then given to banks, credit agencies, and employers who then use that number to determine if you can get a loan, operate your own enterprises, or even what kind of jobs you can do.  We've seen what the government does with information and power.  Why would we ever consider giving it more of both?\n\nBack on topic, America is actually one of the few powerful nations without a fortress for a border wall.  Will people still get over/under/through the wall somehow?  Of course.  Will they still be able to WALK ACROSS the border once a 30 foot concrete structure is in place?  No, and that will stop all but the most determined individuals from trying to get here illegally.",

First, anyone who bought into Trump getting Mexico to pay for the wall, well, here's your sign (cliche, I know, but anyone who did will know what that means). How much is Trump looking to get for the wall now, a few billion right? A few billion dollars for a wall that really isnt going to work anyway? I mean, there are these things called shovels and ladders right? ever hear about the tunnel between Juarez and El Paso? a wall isnt really going to stop much. Jobs? Well, unless more funding goes into the border patrol, there wont be any more officers patrolling, and any construction job will be short lived. a wall alone will build quick and if Trump has his way, the states or local govs will be on the hook for building the wall. Some of these states can hardly afford to keep their roads in good repair, do they have a billion or so to just throw away at a wall and keep it manned and maintained? \nA solution, take a small chunk from our over bloated defense budget and allot it to the border patrol. Get more agents on the ground, better equipped with more modern tech like drones that can easily cover large amount of ground every day, with tech that can more easily spot people than human eyes.",

    "commentText": "one of the few things I've disagreed with him about. The entire ethos and origin of America is a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic society where the only true true Native Americans were moved from homes and tribes relocated so the capital society could continue to grow. The society was heralded as ubiquitously free in terms of society, politics, culture but that has never been the case. Even after the declaration of Independence, black people were still slaves. The wall is a contradiction to the entire birth and origin of the nation. However! What Stephen talks about in terms of the illegal border crossing and cross border drug trade coming from Mexico and Colombia as well the obvious criminal influence and lack of honest working tax paying new citizens from these countries is 100% true. The reality is the amount of entry points cross the border is too vast. Hiring more police to control the border would cause taxes to sky rocket. and poor Leroy suggesting an x-ray I.D tag mechanism, not only at the border, but at various checkpoints in America sounds like a dystopian novel from George Orwell. How do you stop illegal immigration? Stephen probably believes that you have to make it so unbelievably difficult to cross the border, i.e build a wall, that it just would not be worth the hassle. America does have a fear of foreigners though, xenophobia even though all white Americans are descendants from foreign Invaders but then again America never made much sense......",

The statement \"build a wall\" is a flame, no one can argue about that, and it blocks polite people that want to discuss and are open to change their mind: no polite people comes to you if you don't approach a certain issue with the ways they want. The people that this kind of communication style love are SJWs, ignorant feminists and, overall, cunts. Also, this kind of polarizing absolutes like \"there are only 2 genres\", \"we need to build a wall\", \"male privilege is a myth\" are not good for a conversation: you have to say a \"because\" afterwards and explain yourself in the very provoking statement written in the sign, otherwise people can't even try to tackle the metaphorical mountain that is your opinion: you have to give disagreeing people a base to start, otherwise is just you with your opinion implying that everyine who disagrees is wrong. I studied communication techniques, so I know what I'm talking about. You're basically asking cunts to come over and cuss you out: if you want an informed discussion with nice people change the way you approach the streets. That said, the topics discussed here are interesting and the format is just, IMO, badly executed but not bad per se. So, good job, subscribed",

I have also heard people claim the wall will be ineffective, as we hear many chime, \"they will just find other ways to get in\". Others,  some of whom I know personally,  claim the USA is and should be open to all those who wish to enter, believing everyone is entitled to pursuing the American Dream, whether they come legally or not. Humans,  one person in particular said...  We are all humans, not Americans,  not citizens of nations, but humans.  Transhumanism he called it.   The irony of his opinion lies in the fact that he has the Bill of Rights hanging in his living room, but doesn't tolerate opinions that differ from his. Like I said in my earlier comment,  many people are sorely misinformed,  but unfortunately,  many people are also totally brainwashed, willing to believe what master tells them to believe, so long as master says its hip,  its trendy.  Hilariously,  those i know who hold these views,  well,  they seem to think they are badass,  woke,  punk rockers going against the grain.... As they flock together in the name of anti-fascisism and freedom, ironically attempting to shut down anything or anyone they don't agree with.  LMAO yeah,  punk rock! Fucking ants....  Sheep, robots,  Manchurian citizens, cult members,  zombies.... They are so far removed from reality that they have lost all and any appreciation for the natural born rights we,  as humans have, but,  more importantly,  we as Americans, have protected under our glorious constitution.  This brings me back to the wall.... Without walls,  without borders,  we cease to exist as a sovereign nation. Without our sovereignty,  our constitution doesn't matter,  without our constitution,  our rights are no longer protected from those who seek to destroy everything America has become,  what it means to the world,  and what it means for the future of humanity.  The greatest nation to have ever existed in known history needs walls to keep the greatness in,  and the heathens out.\n \nI believe people are seeing through the propaganda, especially thanks to the internet, which has been considerably free flowing since its public debut, but the word is out. The globalsit elite's minions have been exposed bare for all those who wish to look, to see. Without walls,  we would end up seeing only what true evil wants us to see. Instead we have the FREEDOM to see all we are able and make well informed decisions as the good men who founded our country intended us to do.  \n\nThank God for our founding fathers and thank God we, as a nation, were able to lead Donald Trump to the White House. \n\nThis was the longest damned comment I've ever written! So if you read it, awesome! I hope I didn't bore you.\n\nThanks to all the crew working on Louder with Crowder! I love the show,  the guests,  the parody films and the honest and open consideration for others opinions.  I can always depend on you guys to make me laugh!  God bless and keep it up!\n\n#buildthewall #MAGA #GODBLESSAMERICA #louderwithcrowder #notgayjared #changemymind #freespeech #nationsneedborders #protectourcitzens\n#Americafirst",

If we helped these countries grow and root out corruption we'd be reducing the amount of illegal immigrants entering and building stronger relationships with these nations. I know it's not our responsibility and that we have problems of our own, but I can really empathize with those who reside in the country illegally while trying their best to make a living without hurting anyone. Maybe I'm completely wrong and everything I said wouldn't work, but we should take a more positive approach to the situation. Regardless, take my comment with a grain of salt.

In fact, most communities that see an uprise in foreign-born people actually see an increase in stability as opposed to areas that see an increase in the number of African American populace. Interesting study and I'm sure it's not the only one, but I'd like to know where Steven got the source for the statistics he's talking about at 6:50. Here's where I collected my information: http://criminology.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264079.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264079-e-93\n\nAs for my opinion about whether or not there should be a \"wall\" to stop illegal immigrants from entering the country, I'm honestly not really sure. I don't know how well a giant brick wall would demotivate people from trying to get into the country.\n\nEDIT: Thank you guys for taking the time to reply.

    "commentText": "82% of ALL wealth generated last year was directly sent into the pockets of the world's richest 1%. https://www.oxfamamerica.org/explore/research-publications/reward-work-not-wealth/\n\nIt isn't the illegals that are causing your economic anxiety brother. Giving drink to the thirsty should never be an offense of any sort. The world has moved past such barbaric actions through lessons learned from the trail of tears, the nazi's, aparthaid, the american civil rights movement, etc. I'm sorry but you are incredibly naive if you think any illegal immigrant has harmed you in any way ever.\n\nHonestly, a good percentage of those aliens work and can never collect on the social security, unemployment, or pretty much any program so as a result, these people fund our programs and never collect, giving \"natural born\" americans a surplus. The factories moved to mexico, the mexicans didn't move into the factory. No one took anyone's job, at least in any statistically significant number (I should state I am unaware as to the state of the \"migrant farmer\" labor pool among 39 year old white males but I doubt it is bursting at the seams so to speak.) the jobs were simply moved away or automated. I bet anyone who thinks they lost their factory job to a mexican actually lost it to a robot and the mexican is just there to sweep the dust.\n\nThe drugs don't come in on border crossers either, you can get far more just through the post, with less witnesses. Often traffickers will ship heavy work trucks or front loaders, basically any equipment, stuff the gas tank full of drugs, and take some metal off to make the weight check out normally, and just ship the truck. Why strap 50lbs of dope to some poor immigrant who could go anywhere and use any name and instantly make a couple years salary when you can ship your buddy a caterpillar dump truck with 500kilos in it? Also you can get smaller amounts through customs fairly easily, just in an envelope. The drugs should be legal anyway, and trust me, there's a few thousand characters coming your way after this post showing why.\n\nWhat else do y'all say about undocumented persons? Crime? They commit far less crime than Timmy or Susie down the road, statistically. One fifth actually to be specific. We could probably get this number lower if the aliens here could call the police on the criminals amongst them without fear of deportation. That's a part I don't think you really get, if they're in their neighborhood and see a mugging, and they call 911, they might end up on the same bus back as the criminal, and all his buddies back home are just waiting to kill them. Is that just? Does that please you if it means your imaginary line was abided by? You might argue they commit less crime because we kick them out or other ridiculous nonsense, but they actually thought of that and looked at the specific causes, and because CNN and NYT are \"fake news\" here's the direct study http://www.nber.org/papers/w13229.pdf. You'll want to read the \"Abstract,\" just in case you weren't familiar with academic articles, something tells me you lot don't read too many of them. It's actually because the groups that self select to make the difficult and arduous journey, are actually the same kind of folks who believe in working hard to better your life through blood, sweat, and tears, so their kids can have it easier than they did. Sounds pretty god damn American to me.\n\nAll recreational drugs should be legal. We need to end the ban of all recreational drugs. There are numerous reasons for the legalization of all drugs. I'm in the northeast USA, I see the opioid epidemic first hand and overdoses would be much rarer in a legal regime, as they are primarily a result of fentanyl being used as a cut, or much more rarely dealers setting up a hot bag designed to cause an OD to show the comparative strength of their product compared to competitors. Prohibition of any substance is bound to fail, as it completely ignores human nature. Furthermore, the vast majority of negative effects of heroin, meth, or other \"hard' drugs are actually a result of the illegal black market and wouldn't be present in a legal regime, not to argue they're harmless, certainly not, but you simply cannot write off the overwhelming amount of downsides solely resulting from the legal situation.\n\nthe war on drugs serves no purpose other than giving police carte blanche justification to violate americans fourth amendment rights (searching vehicles because they \"smell weed\", stop-and-frisk, etc.), ignores the rights of many in the developing world, fails to stem the supply of any drug, stigmatizes people simply for preferring substances other than booze (which is actually more harmful than any other recreational drug; source: http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(10)61462-6/abstract), funds illegal gangs, cartels, and terrorist organizations, and creates an enviroment where both users and law enforcement are at an immesurably greater risk of injury or death. No knock raids put police and citizens at great risk for little reason, usually in the name of the war on drugs. When distribution is in the hands of criminals they are likely to maximise their profit margins by enhancing their product with fentanyl, as it's cheap and 50 times stronger than heroin (To illustrate it's affordability I was once given a free 100mg sample of pure fentanyl hcl, all it cost was postal charges); this is the primary cause of the overdose epidemic gripping America. https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7316428-fentanyl-found-in-80-per-cent-of-street-drugs-tested-in-b-c-study/\n\nIn a legal regime the government could produce drugs, sell them at cost through state drug stores, ensuring adults only have access and that they are sold things in proper dosage increments and standardized purity, with sterile, safe paraphernalia (To prevent transmission of diseases and damage from old or dirty gear). The tax revenue could fund responsible use drug education and allow treatment centers to be better equipped and more effective, this would also help reduce the stigma of both drug use and abuse, with abuse being treated similarly to alcohol abuse is. Harm reduction measures such as reagent testing, injection and use sites, etc would further alleviate problems arising from use as well. It is against the value of liberty to prohibit recreational substances from consenting adults, and gives police justification for their militarization that's been going on the past few decades.\n\nSmall town law enforcement does not need apcs and other specialized military and intelligence hardware, it only reinforces societal distrust, nor does every single cop need a weapon on them at all times, they should at the very least have extra training or certification in advanced deescalation tactics or only have them in their car to respond to lethal threats and lethal threats only to lead to them exploring more avenues for deescalation, prior to even considering deadly force. Also, prices of drugs would be drastically lower in a legal market allowing users to partake without breaking the bank financially further reducing property crime associated with addictions.\n\nIn conclusion the war on drugs is the single greatest injustice to happen today, and it even fails to deliver results. Heroin, meth, or crack will never be completely eradicated, no drug will be, prohibition just harms users and causes a plethora of problems. Also, to clarify, some substances, ie carfentanil are too potent to not be considered chemical weapons and should still be regulated as such. Until the police unilaterally end enforcement of drug laws I consider them an enemy of the people and an oppressive force designed to keep the working class down at the behest of the monied elite",

The fact of the matter is the majority of the people coming across that border illegally are coming to look for better economic opportunities that aren’t available in their country, and do not have the resources available to apply for legal entry into the US. Even if a wall were to be built there will still be people coming across it. It is a terrible waste of money that can be used for better purposes.

It's so essential to challenge people's views and our own to maintain a level of evolution. Your talk on hate speech was great. As a black person I've been spat at, jumped, called a nigger, and denied service... But I would never put myself in a position where I would want to pretend that this doesn't exist. When you ban someone's way of thinking you not only violate their rights, but you also take away any chance you have of changing their opinion. The world can't be a place where anything that offends you should be tucked away. So from a modern day Socialism believing, advocate of not raising the minimum wage in Canada to $15/hr, supporter of different gender roles, non-supporter of making people accept your gender role because you said so (or calling it an act of violence), and supporter of gun control...

There's always. Group of people that gives a bad reputation to the rest of the group. Also most of the illegal people work for a living and pay taxes but can't use any of the benefits.

Hence wouldnt solving the drug lord etc issues mexico help us more than building a wall? cus it seems that thats the real issues here",

From some places,  i heard that it would be more like 40 feet tall and much more thick? I also say \"us\" because it's seems more than far fetched to think that Mexico would pay for it. We don't need a wall,  we need to better our way of handling these immigrants. I wouldn't know where to begin with that,  but maybe putting more people into the border patrol or improving the measures they take could be a start.",

    "commentText": "Alright Crowder you should read this. The wall should not be built, whatsoever. The fact of the matter is, just as gun restriction laws are somewhat ineffective, wether you can get a gun legally or can’t. Chances are with the time and motive you will get a gun, same thing with immigration. There are many other methods to crossing borders illegally, one of the major ones being: cross the border legally with a temporary visa or something similar, and simply overstay your time. A major percent of these illegal immigrants simply use this tactic, according to NBC News which cited a report made in 2014, 42% of illegal immigrants used this tactic. Granted it is likely since then the statistic had changed, although I presume it is close to the 2014 study. This alone accounts for close to half the unauthorized immigrants in the US. Rubio, and Jeb Bush have both said it, and now so has Ramos, a news anchor said that 40% of illegal immigrants enter the states using air transportation. Now both of these numbers can’t be added up because some of the overstayers I assume use air as a transportation method. Although likely not all, so let’s just say 70% of immigrants enter using the “overstay” method, or just by planes. This leaves us with 30% left, seems reasonable. Today there is approximately 12 million unauthorized immigrants in the US, 30% of that is 4 million. Which isn’t bad, that’s a lot of people. So assuming that the wall would stop that 30% would be plenty of reason to build it. But fact if he matter is thst it won’t, not even all illegal immigrants cross the US’ southern border, or even come from close countries in Central America. Close to around 50-60% of illegal immigrants are from Central American countries, so let’s half that 30% number. Now we have 15%, at this point it’s a questionable 21 billion dollars spending, especially because immigrants account for a large amount of our economy within food export. So for me, we could build the wall, it’s possible, although people would find new ways. Just a out of the ass guess, it would ultimately stop 5-10% of immigrants. Which isn’t enough, let’s spend that money on fixing some frickin roads (any car enthusiasts reading this?) No but in reality, it would almost be useless, a waste of money. I don’t know, I don’t presume to understand everything about immigration, although it seems the wall would be much more of a display of power rather than an effective method of blocking illegal immigrants. I’m happy to respond to some comments or counter arguments, especially from mister Crowder, hope everyone has a good day!",

If you think it is for welfare, or \"anchor babies\" making amendments to the laws would seem easier than a giant wall that has to go through many people's properties against their wishes. Many immigrants just want to work jobs that many Americans won't. Getting in the country legally is not easy, especially if you have no family connections here.  If laws are unreasonable, people will break them. Imagine if your state set the speed limit on the highway to 20 mph. Would you consider yourself a criminal speeding in it? Many of the problems that Central America including Mexico faces is the dangers from drug wars. There are many immigrants seeking safety in the US. Why not focus on eliminating the drug wars? \n\nThere are much easier and more effective solutions than building a giant wall and hiring a bunch of security. The wall is dumb, change my mind.",

People wouldn't want to risk coming across illegally if they're going to do the exact same thing. Plus, police are much much tighter here than down there. People that are coming illegally don't want to be criminals, they are people who used to be criminals but have turned a new leaf and want to start over here, but can't pass the background check.\n\nPlus, if anything the wall would just keep people in. The bulk of illegal immigrants want to come in, work for a bit, then go back to their families in Mexico. The wall will just encourage people to stay in, making things worse rather than better. \n\nAlso, over 30% of illegal immigrants came here LEGALLY on PLANES and merely overstayed their visa. What will a wall do about that?\n\nBut let's say it worked perfectly. Let's say the wall worked completely perfectly and absolutely NO MORE IMMIGRANTS came in. Would it even be worth it then? Have you ever stopped to think about how much it would cost to build a wall nobody could break or climb through the thousands of miles of rough terrain that is the US southern border? BILLIONS. The type of money we don't have.\n\nOh, I also should probably include the fact that this isn't the fucking Sims. That shit won't build in 24 hours. You know how long skyscrapers take to build? Imagine a thousands of miles unbreakable unclimbable wall. If it started today, Trump could get a second term (which he damn well won't) and he'd still be out if office by the time it was done. \n\n\nBut why should you believe me? You don't have to. But you'll believe Congress when even the Republicans that let him carry through with all of his dumbass decisions shut his shit down. In minutes.",

If it was so easy to fix, it would have been fixed a long time ago.  People want money put towards reforms, but money has ALREADY been put towards reforms over the years.  Things have only gotten worse.  We need a border, we need to know who is coming here.  Migrants need to enter the legal way so they can start their path to citizenship.  It makes me so angry to know Illegals receive more benefits than actual citizens.  They don't want to be Americans but they want all the rights that go with being a citizen. They also want to be able to travel back and forth. They get paid under the table and send the money back home to Mexico. I don't have to explain why criminals don't want citizenship. \n\nWhen I was in service, one of the guys I worked with joined the Navy just to get his citizenship.  It took him four years, and he finally got it.  We shut down to throw him a party and he didn't have to, but about a week later he reenlisted for another four years.  That man is an American and a true patriot. He worked damned hard for his citizenship. There are people like him all across America and they have to see their hard work basically spit on by people who just want all the advantages but don't want to work for them.

Then, I think to myself, … This guys \"idea\" sounds kind of like RFID tagging,  and also a lot like a significant step towards the biblical 'mark of the beast'.   I always thought there was no way, anyone, would voluntarily \"be chipped\" and have their bio identity stored and used to track them etc.   But it is already taking place in India, where they are using a system called \"Aadhaar\".  This utilizes a 12-digit unique identity number that can be obtained and utilized by residents of India, based on their individual and unique biometric and demographic data, Aadhaar can track them and be utilized for buying and selling etc.  ~ I'm still for building a wall.",

I wonder if he's give any thought to the extreme ramifications of his xray wall.  Essentially every person in this country would be giving up their freedom by allowing the government to pin point us at all times.  Sure you could claim that the tagging  was only for illegals but according to Leroy they would be given citizenship and taxed.  That means that the entire population of the US would also need to be tagged.  There are plenty of people out there who I'm sure wont think that's a big deal because they don't think that they are doing anything that would warrant the government monitoring them but they would be wrong.  We are already being closely monitored by the NSA without consent, so why would anyone be naive enough to think that this xray border wall would be different.  What if a person holds different political, religious or social opinions to the party in power, would those people then be targeted?  Probably.

Also, people speak about lack of or poor border security. My experience has been that we have excellent border security. There are large border patrol facilities that are supported with agents, trucks, ATV's, helicopter's and more. If you are around the border you will be stopped and question by the border patrol pretty quickly. I've been stopped five times in one day. But check it out for yourself, go walk around the border and see how quickly you will be approached and questioned by the border patrol.",

I think there are two issues with this physical border. Firstly, its an economic problem, because most certainly the Mexicans won't pay for that lol, and i don't think the American citizens want their hard earned money to go into something criminals just hop over. The second one, which is i think the main point why people are against a wall, is that it seems unethical. We had walls in our history before (GERMANY) and the pictures of this time don't connote a happy society.(I know that this wall wouldn't seperate a country itself, but still a lot of families would have it much more difficult to see each other.) Moving into an open world where everyone has the freedom to travel around freely, accept new people and live in plurality, the building of a wall would be the exact opposite picture of tolerance acceptance and embracement of new people and culture, even if it doesn't intend to do so. I get the point, as long as you are legal, the wall wouldn't change anything,everyone would still be welcomed, legally. It doesn't even change anything right now because that same wall is already there imaginative since you cant/shouldn't  just get into America illegally. In it's core, i think that everyone is for and against that ''wall'', because you are most definitely not racist Steven, everyone wants to separate the bad sheeps from the good ones. So we can live in peace and harmony. Oh my fuck i wrote all of this. If I only was half as encouraged in school.",

A physical wall, I don't believe, will stop people from coming into the country illegally.\n\nI think illegal immigrants are given a bad wrap as inherently bad people because they happen to break a single law. The US expects them to be murderers, thieves, killers, the like. I don't agree that that is likely at all.\n\nI think the solution to fixing the immigration problem is to simplify the process of legal immigration financially and bureaucratically. Immigration isn't in itself a problem. America doesn't need to be sheltered by foreigners who are able and willing to work harder for less pay, because that level of competition stimulates an economy.",

Be more responsible and try changing your own mind just for the fun of it. see what happens.

I’m an avid outdoorsman, I hunt, I fish and I’m an environmental conservationist. I believe in secure borders, but the wall is going to damage so much natural landscape, and for animals the border along the Rio grande is their only way to get water. I think upping border security would be more effective. These people that cross over illegally are gunna find more unconventional methods of crossing. I believe that upping border security will incentivize people to not smuggle where there’s heavy security and if the whole border has security we can expect smuggling operations to get busted more frequently while also create safer places for cities and towns along the border. Some of these people’s lives depend on finding a new home or smuggling drugs and wall isn’t going to scare these people off. They’ll keep trying till they have a ladder to clime, or break a hole though it. These are just what if’s but it’s what I believe",

For one, Illegal Immigrants do not commit more crime than anyone else, according to the most recent statistics, there is no signs showing that Illegal Immigrants create a dispraportionate amount of crime, and in fact when arrested it's usually for a much less worse crime. Secondly, the idea of an actual border wall is pretty ridiculous. Estimates have put it at 70 billion dollars to build as well as 150 million dollars to maintain, a cost that is ridiculous considering that the success of a border wall in keeping out criminals is questionable at best. But last of all, Illegal Immigrants benefit this nation. Illegal Immigrants pay billions of dollars in taxes every year, but never actually see any of those benefits for themselves like medicare or medicaid, which means that they are just paying American citizens so they can live thier own lifestyles. Overall, while legal immigration is preferable, all evidence shows that a wall is absolutely not the solution",

Because EVERY TIME someone buys food, gas, clothing,  or whatever;  guess what, they pay taxes. Some may want to try to argue they don't pay \"labor taxes\".

Also not that many immigrants cross by the border, in fact many studies show that most immigrants come to the United States by airplanes and just overstaying there visa.

Also a lot of people with privet farms, which their families have owned for many years, would be forced to sell their land to the government for much less than a civilian sale of which they would not wish to do in the first place, but would have no choice since the government has the right to take you land for \"market value\"any time they wish ... not to say the wall isn't a possible solution to a problem i just think that the cost is to great when the majority isn't entering that way.

It's not tall enough even the one we currently have now (in some places) isn't tall even if it was it'd be as easy as getting a bigger ladder and a regular matters to guard from barbs so for it to be effective it would literally have to be massive and the cost would be unbelievable. 2. The majority of illegal immigrants don't even come across the wall/open border they come through checkpoints but just use really admittedly intelligent and creative ways to sneak in also it's as easy as coming in through a plane and overstaying(never leaving) your papers such as a visa(that's if they can get them because the process is backed up years. Seriously though many don't even cross the border that way because it's dangerous it's mostly the very desperate with 0 cash that are getting away from something. 3. The terrain makes it very difficult the build a wall there which actually makes it impossible to build a wall in some places. Even if they did use enginuity and come up with a way it would sure as he'll be many times more expensive but it would be destroyed of natural causes in those areas. In other words nature will beat the wall. There's solid reasons without putting anything about all that immigrants could actually contribute to out economy which ik a majority of the idiots here will just shout fake news at and spit regurgitated blatant lies they heard from sources that only give them the partial news that they want hear and say anything otherwise is lies no matter how obvious or legitimate the information may be.",

The very idea that a physical wall will stop this when you can just go over it or under it or even blow a hole through it with explosives is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. If anyone says we can monitor thousands of miles accurately and efficiently allow me to also introduce you to the concept that our government has never been compitent at anything it does. Don't believe me? Go to the dmv for five minutes or watch a video of congress. Not to mention the expense of this nonsense fiasco. Plus this doesn't address the people that will come on legal visas and just stay which is much more of the problem than people hopping a wall or fence. How does everyone also forget the thousands of miles of coast we have that is also not properly monitored? For example the state of Washington has so few state troopers patrolling its costal road that there have been numerous documentaries on it. The idea that this will work in any fashion is ludicrous and foolish just like the xray wall created by this certified genius. It's just a stupid xenophobic nonsense campaign promise created to whip up the uneducated and get them to vote. We can all agree that reforms and valid ideas for immigration need to take place, however there so far have not been any valid plans put forth by any political leaders to achieve those goals yet and likely never will. Nobody is ever truly interested in solving problems, only getting in to office and grabbing money and power or to serve their 1% masters or corporate overlords that keep them in their political positions. Instead of making videos exposing idiots and uneducated fools why don't you spend some of that time to construct an actual idea that will solve the problem and propose it using your platform. Oh wait that's because it doesn't make money or push your agenda........ The problem with this country isn't just liberals or right wing people, it's all the people playing both sides and enciting these idiots to begin with. It's literally all just a giant circle jerk of uneducated neuro surgeons running around trying to be dumber than each other and validating their own beliefs and biases opposed to considering the correct answers and compromising to find a middle ground that actually solves the problems we all face together and making it work.",

I don’t think you can possibly stop the problems with a stupid wall, they will build tunnels under it, throw the drug over it, you name it, its a complete waste and it send an awful racist message to the world. You dont have to live all paranoid about immigrants because a small percentage of them behave poorly. Overall they add more than what they take from you so, it would be nice to see some gratefulness from Americans back to those hard working immigrants that have helped a lot to make America what it is today. And always remember stats are often times awful oversimplifications. They commit crime in a disproportionated way, you know what they also do in disproportionated way? Hard work and if you ask me, i think thats the real reason you have trouble with them, because they compete with you in the labour market so you need the gangsters of government protecting you from the laws of offer and demand.",

    "commentText": "Well shit, reading through the comments, it looks like I'm the only one that feels really fucking ripped off by the fact that I changed my mind video was only 10 minutes long. When I saw that this was uploaded I was so excited for the next installment to change my mind. I was really bummed to find out this wasn't the next installment at all, just a 10 minute teaser video that never got into the debt to other change my mind installments inevitably end up delving into. Felt like a really wasted opportunity, I mean what you had on in the 10 minutes was worth watching but, when you tend to do an hour-long show for the segments for everyone so far, and then you get to this one, the topic matter being kind of a big deal these days, especially to America First Advocates like myself, I kind of expect it to match up with the other segments. It doesn't matter how good the 10 minutes is, there's just not enough content there to say it's another actual installment to the series. I mean... seriously? 10 minutes is all you could get? You couldn't find anybody, like maybe put it off for another week and invite somebody to actually have a conversation like all the other Change My Mind videos feature? I mean I know that you prefer the organic approach of just letting whoever sit down, but if you couldn't get anybody to do that aside from the people walking by and yelling obscenities, you probably could have made an exception and invited somebody to actually try and change your mind on the subject. That would have been a lot more worth watching. That said if anybody on the staff of the louder with Crowder show reads this, I love your show generally speaking, like this upload to, I feel like I should mention that since I don't comment very often to say how much I like the videos as you go, it tends to pipe up when I have criticisms, so it might seem a little lopsided from a so-called fan when all you ever see from them is a comment like this, but yeah, I am actually a fan so, try not to take it the wrong way. You know 10 minutes for a series where every other video has been about an hour, sometimes more, is kind of weak sauce.",

And I have yet to find any sources anywhere that agree with these statistics that 3.5% of the population accounts for 37% of homicides. Normally, honest people will provide valid sources in their description that back their claims. And yet there isn't a single source link anywhere on the page.\n\n In 2016 Latinos (illegal or mot) made up 14% of all arrests for murder and nonnegligent manslaughter.\n\nhttps://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/topic-pages/tables/table-21\n\nIn 2015 they made up 16% of the arrests.\n\nhttps://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/tables/table-43\n\nIn 2014 15.8%\n\nhttps://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/table-43\n\nConsidering that the overwhelming majority of illegal immigrants are Latino, and that Latinos account for roughly 16% of annual murders, I find it pretty hard to believe that illegal immigrants are somehow accountable for 37% of all murders. Especially considering that every statistic I have seen thus far completely disagrees with such nonsense.\n\nAnd for all of you saying I'm wrong, I would ask that you actually provide sources like I did rather than making red herrings, or factless statements.",

Anyway,\nHere is the info he is referring to.\n\n“Between 2008 and 2014, illegal immigrants accounted for 38 percent of all murder convictions in California, Texas, Arizona, Florida and New York despite accounting for just 5.6 percent of the total population in those states, according to a report compiled by the Government Accountability Office (GAO).”",

The children had a bed--no doubt a first for many- as well as good and consistent food to eat---how many of them went to bed hungry more often than not prior to their arrival in the camps? In addition, they got free new clothes and proper health care---how many of them had, no doubt, never seen a doctor or even a nurse in their lives? To suggest that the treatment  of these children is in any way reminiscent of Nazi Germany is a blood libel against the president, and the American people whose hard earned tax dollars payed for the proper care of these children whom they did not invite into the country.",

A wall isn't gonna stop overstaying work or student visas. And also isn't going to stop immigrants in the U.S. legally teaching others how to get in.  But relaxing legal immigration laws might mean that people gravitate toward doing it legally and stop them from hiring coyotes or smuggling drugs to get here because it is a better option. Why can't anyone else see that. I lean left from a conservative standpoint and honestly if we spend more money stopping immigration than from allowing it, it doesn't make cents....",

Not through borders. Until people see how countries are where illegal immigrants are coming from. Until privileged people ( Not saying you’re privileged Crowder) see what it’s like to be in fear for your life where either you go into selling drugs or being a slave for cartels or else you die, they will be forever opposing people coming here illegally. Perhaps if the US helped in a minor way to clean up those counties, the poor people who can’t afford work visas or can’t prove that they own property, will keep on coming to safety. El Salvador, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Mexico, and even South American countries all immigrate to the land of opportunity to survive. And I believe we can find a legal way to get them help. Through work visas or even implementing a program where companies go to those countries providing then with jobs. Yet the US gain a percent of the income gained from them. Idk a legal alternative to ending the suffering and forcing of them fleeing to safety here in the US.",

I know if you cross illegally into any Latin American country and if you managed somehow to obtain fraudulent paperwork-documentation, get a job and afterwards get caught, you would be prosecuted, incarcerated and then deported along with the rest of your family should they be there also illegally.\nFor the Latino community to think that somehow they should be exempted from immigration laws of the US supply because they are from the same continent is purely nonsense. Build the wall, deport all illegals and use the US Military to patrol the border whislt the wall is being build.\nI am not a hater but their problems shouldn't be our problems especially the gang culture and the rest of the illegals that prey on the legal immigrants like that lady in the segment.\nGood job as always, looking for new topics to watch and discuss.",

To continue getting access to anything like that, you would need to be hardworking, taxpaying member of society. Of course, before anything like that could happen, you would need to crack down on things like unlicensed drivers. \n\nI have the luxury of living in a small country (the U.K.), and so it's so much easier for the government to keep these things regulated. I don't know anyone without a drivers licence or insurance that drives a car, or anyone that has made purchases of a similar size to cars without going through all the legal procedures. It's very difficult to commit crimes like that and not get caught in a country where there's very few places to hide!\n\nI don't agree that a wall is the solution, because as many others have stated, they will always find a way. It's main purpose is a stroke to ego (and to beat China's great wall, I'm sure). It certainly makes a statement that the US is desperate to keep out immigrants, and doesn't care about the fiscal cost.",

The drug war is a large part of the problem and is often left out of the popular discussion. getting back on point, i agree with you on many topics... just not this one. the great wall of china did little against Genghis Khan and had an extremely high cost in both blood and construction. not saying that our wall would have similar construction costs. however,  if we were to wisely look to the past we as a country should realize that if you can't beat them then join them. Similar to China and Mongolia forming one united China as we know today. \n\n     my argument is this:\nlets stop the Mexican american border war by creating a new partnership that will let north america unify under a similar governing rule as the EU/UN. my thoughts are that Canada, USA, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Nicaragua, and Costa Rico should create a new world super power of sorts.  aimed at world preservation over conquest because the world is really not all that big and a wall across panama (think canal) would be way more effective in the improvement of all of north america. my overall thought is that if we all play for the same team and we all support the team in different ways then we all win?\n\n    God Bless America and our future; unite against the robots that will, in our lifetime, leave around 1 billion  people looking for different ways to make a living.. OR if no humans have to work.... what do humans do with life. \n\neveryone please feel free to poke holes in my argument. otherwise, whats the point?\n\nps- mr. crowder; it may be slightly outside of your wheelhouse, however, please consider doing a show on robots and our future with AI and how we think we fit in. consider this: when we create real AI it will instantly become the smartest thing on the planet . . . . what happens next?",

If you think you're going to be offended and you read this anyway, you deserve whatever happens to you.\n\n1) In response to \"There Are Only 2 Genders - Change My Mind\"\n\nI can agree with Steven that there ARE only 2 Genders (Female and Male).  However, that does NOT mean that it is a binary discussion.  I disagree with the assertion that it is \"an entire spectrum\" as some have argued, but I am both intellectually and morally compelled to accept more than just \"one or the other\".  Even Steven can admit that there is a small percentage of people with BIOLOGICALLY PROVABLE conditions that classify them as \"Intersex\".  They may present as primarily \"Male\" or \"Female\", but they are, in fact, a separate category that, at a biological and purely scientific level, is \"Both\".  Right there, I've proven that there are only 2 Genders, but THREE separate options.\n\nAnd I know I'm going to trigger a great many people when I point this out (not that I care), but I feel that any post-op \"Trans\" person falls into a fourth category.  We have \"One\", \"The Other\", \"Both\" and the fourth category, \"None\".  While I support most people in the LGB Community (yes, I shortened it on purpose), I think the entire concept of \"Trans\" is delusional and self-destructive.  This is not some \"trans-phobic\" rant.  This is me saying that I believe the core concepts that \"Trans\" people defend so strongly and hold so dearly to are poorly thought out, logically unsound and show a dangerous lack of critical thinking.  I've heard the arguments, I've read the data, I've heard the rhetoric and accusations directed at anyone who doesn't agree...and I'm not impressed.  I'm not saying I'm definitely right.  I'm just saying you're going to have to come up with something a lot better than what you have so far to convince me you're not wrong.",

Look if chossing to build a wall or have Uncle Sam track me down like cattle is the only solutions we have ,I'll take the wall please. With that aside what the lady said is true look a of these illegals don't respect the law or anyone else who is not of their fold even other Mexicans. This is the same problems blacks had with the north and south, with the southern blacks resenting the northern blacks because they were doing well for themselves. When people say why we should build that Wall all I have to say is this, the Mexican government is corrupt that is common knowledge, the problem is every time discontent and unsettlement rises people tend to runaway from the problems and just like in real life nothing changes from running away so when you have a huge ass wall to prevent you from running away you have one of two options you fight an start a revolution to change the system or keep living in shit but it let it be know that a man can only take so much shit before he starts pushing back. So yeah I think we need that Wall for both Americans and Mexicans sake this immigration problem which was start by Bill Clintons ineptitude needs to end.",

The Mexican government is know for being one of the world's most corrupt governments, so if you make them pay the exorbitant amount of money required to erect that wall, Mexico will either be in debt with the American government or the country will suffer from a crisis that will result in a larger number of people trying to get into the US. The problem must be solved from its roots: the amount of insecurity in Mexico and the inefficient educational system. If the US were to invest the money that would be invested into the wall into making sure the Mexican people don't get involved in the drug business and get a better education (I know that it is not the American's responsibility but the Mexican government sucks at its job) the number of illegal immigrants would dramatically fall.",

Most people who come from Mexico illegally, aren't doing it to sell and distribute drugs, or commit other crimes. Most want to come to have a better life. And I don't see a problem with that. I have grown up in a area with quite a few illegal immigrants, and you learn to sympathize. I think we sometimes forget that they are people as well. It's easy to sit back and say \"You shouldn't be here, go back to where you came from until you are legal,\" when you don't understand what some go through. It can take years for people to get accepted to live here legally, and many don't have that much time. Now, am I saying everyone come over illegally? No. I wish everyone could come over legally, but sadly that's not always an option.",

I would love to have an opportunity to talk and hear out some of the opinions/beliefs that you talk about on your channel. I would like to make it clear that I don’t agree with about every single controversial topic you talk about on your channel.

I don’t want to change your mind, but I would love to have an opportunity to talk to you freely without prejudice or discrimination about why I disagree with you on most of these topics. I think that this platform shouldn’t be captioned with “change my mind” but with, “open my mind”.

    "commentText": "I'd like to point out that the real reason that the left opposes border security, and wants illegal immigration, is because illegal aliens are counted in the census, which results in states with large illegal populations getting more electoral votes and seats in the house of representatives.  This is why those democrat-run states are declaring sanctuaries.  Over 70% of the illegal population lives in blue states, so even when illegals aren't actively voting in our elections, they are still influencing our entire election process just by being here.\n\nThe next census takes place in 2020, and blue states are going to get more seats and more votes distributed to them.  Make sure to vote in the midterms, get as many democrats out of office as possible, and help President Trump  fix our illegal immigration problem.  As the propagandists in the news say, \"this is very dangerous to our democracy\".",

    "commentText": "Okay, a rant.\nMy Late-Father, who was a HARD man to live with, would be (or is) RAGING in his grave because he LOVED the U.S., he and my Mom came to the U.S. legally from Honduras in the early 1960's to live a better life of their own, and have much better opportunities for themselves and raising a family, so that me and my Brother could have the freedom to be whatever we wanted. Me and my father lived with racism, only when we moved to Louisiana in 1971 and lived there for 7 LONG years, but I would NEVER judge others, or the whole \"South\" with that redneck mentality that we dealt with just about everyday. Me in School by Black, White and Cajun people, and Teachers, and my father got into fights at the Shipyards as a welder. We came back to California and had a much better life. The experience we lived in the South, did not make us hate southerners, or hate people of color, or make us angry to blame others for the hate we dealt with. My father and mother worked damned hard to live in better homes and safer communities that were \"multi-cultural\", working class cities. My papa instilled in us that if we wanted something, we had to go get it with hard work and let nothing deter us from our dreams, no blame, no excuses, it was up to us. I'm not living the high life, I hate my current 9 to 5 job, had success in the past designing video games, and trying to get back into film production, even had a bout with homelessness for a year and a half in the late 90's . . . but its up to me to get up and kick the obstacles out of the way. Life is hard, but each of us has to do what we have to (without taking advantage of people and have ethics, morals and common decency), to find success and peace of mind.\nWe were not \"criminals\", nor did we \"hang out\" with any. I feel for that 1st woman, she feels and deals with the danger, and doesn't want to see her community deteriorate. I've seen cities I've lived in the past in California, fall into corruption from their officials, and those allowed to live in their communities (see videos for the city council of the City \"Cudahy\" in LA county).\n\nTo the \"statistics\" the 2nd young man wants, this is from; \"Mexico's Citizens' Council for Public Security's annual ranking of the world's most violent cities\": http://www.businessinsider.com/most-violent-cities-in-the-world-2018-3\nOUR \"culture\" has been power hungry, corrupt and violent (but what culture hasn't?) since before Christ, and leaving the shores of Spain, Italy, Portugal and coming across the Americas. My family comes from #25 on that list, it was #1 in 2015. It wasn't like that before the 70's, but the regimes and cartels have gotten worse and corrupted Mexico. Again, if these countries are soo great, why come here to the U.S.? And then see Latino/Hispanic Radical groups spreading propaganda and chanting \"America was never great!\", then WHY did YOUR parents come here??? Or telling so-called \"Whites\" - \"Go back to Europe!\", well you people may need to come with us, where is your LAST NAMES from?\nI wasn't born in Europe, even though I'm of Spanish & Italian heritage, so where do I go back? South Central LA? Pomona, LaPuente, El Paso, Phoenix, Houston, New Orleans, The Bronx, Miami?\nWhat about those Mexicans that mingled with the Spanish and native tribes - what about those \"Californios\"? Or the \"Tejanos\" that fought WITH the U.S. Militias during the Alamo? Sorry for the history lesson/rant but all this rhetoric and narratives that many of these latinos spout or believe in (look up the history of Spanish/Mexicans and Native Tribes in the Spanish territories), would make my father rage and weep. WHY keep separating and segregating yourselves from the rest of us, and obey the laws and principles of OUR, (for everyone!) Constitution? No one, or my parents, grandparents or myself, persecuted, killed or enslaved any race for the past 75+ years. Whoever did in my own family . . . they're dead and gone.\nStand in line, become a citizen so you won't have to worry about being deported. What's not to understand?",

    "commentText": "Well, it's time for me to make some more enemies.\n\nSo much of most peoples' political beliefs, including among people\nwho consider themselves to be pro-freedom, stems from false\nassumptions, and from the belief in that mythical beast called\n\"authority.\"\n\nWe now scoff at the old belief in the \"divine right of kings\": the\nnotion that, by an accident of birth, someone had more rights than\nother people, and had the right to forcibly control those other\npeople. Silly, huh? Well, that ridiculous belief is back, and it's\ncalled \"illegal immigration.\"\n\nHow, exactly, does someone born several THOUSANDS miles away, in\nAlaska, have an inherent RIGHT to stand in El Paso, Texas, but\nsomeone born in Ciudad Juarez, just across the river, doesn't\n(without special permission from the tyrants in Washington)?\n\nA lot changes when you lose the self-contradictory belief in\n\"government.\" A lot of concepts you accepted as self-evident\nevaporate, such as country borders, citizenship, patriotism, and\nnationalism. Take, for example, that imaginary line between Mexico\nand the U.S. What is it? How did it get there? It is the boundary\nbetween the dirt which one set of tyrants claims the right to rule,\nand the dirt which another set of tyrants claims the right to rule.\nYou can wave the flag all you want, and talk about \"your\" country\nand \"patriotism,\" but the fact is, country boundaries are based\nentirely upon the inherently bogus, arbitrary claims of the RIGHT\nTO RULE made by various megalomaniacs.\n\nYou have no more \"right\" to be here than someone born in Zimbabwe,\nor Budapest, or anywhere else. Therefore, you have no right to use\nforce to stop them from coming here, nor can you delegate to\nsomeone ELSE the right to do so. To put it as bluntly as I can, ALL\n\"immigration laws\" are 100% illegitimate, unjustifiable violence--\nall of them, in every country, under any circumstances.\n\nYou can wave \"laws\" around, wave the Constitution around, and make\ngeneralizations all you want, but if you forcibly stop someone who\nonly wants to walk from one piece of dirt to another, YOU are the\none initiating violence; YOU are the bad guy. (If, on the other\nhand, the piece of dirt he wants to walk on is your own personal\nproperty, you have the right to keep him off. But unless you\nbelieve you personally own this entire COUNTRY, that cannot\npossibly justify any \"immigration\" laws.)\n\nOddly, as often happens, in the case of immigration, FREEDOM gets\nthe blame for problems caused by TYRANNY. \"But those dang Mexicans\ncome over here and get public benefits, and welfare, and free\nschooling!\" So which is the problem: them walking over an invisible\nline, or YOUR \"government\"-consisting entirely of Americans-\nforcibly robbing one person to give a handout to someone else?\n\nIf someone accepts stolen property, that's bad. And it's bad\nregardless of where the person was born, or what imaginary lines he\nhas walked over. So why do Americans whine about \"illegals\" getting\ngovernment benefits more than they do about the millions of\nAmerican parasites doing the same thing? (I won't even bother\ngetting into the actual statistics on which demographic groups get\nmore government goodies, and which produce more for the economy,\nbecause it's beside the point.)\n\nAnd how backwards and fascist is it to have the attitude of: \"Well,\nyou MIGHT apply for government handouts, so we're going to use\nforce to keep you out of this country\"? Guilty until proven\ninnocent? Yep. Those who want to come here \"legally\" have to go to\ngreat lengths to prove that they will be productive, and not a\ndrain on society. (Hilariously, they have to prove this to people\nin \"government,\" who themselves are nothing BUT a drain on\nsociety.)\n\nMind you, I'm not saying I agree with \"amnesty\" for \"illegals.\" The\nonly reason I don't, however, is that the people who have no right\nto STOP people from coming here also have no right to give them\nPERMISSION to come here, which is what \"amnesty\" means. People born\non this planet (or on any others, for that matter) have the right\nto come here, just as much as you have the right to be here. It's a\nlittle funny that so many people whose grandparents came here from\nEurope, Africa, Asia, and so on, are now whining that Mexicans have\nno right to be on this piece of dirt. (The Americans indians are\nprobably getting a chuckle out of that.) And don't whine about some\ndoing it \"legally,\" because that makes exactly NO difference when\nit comes to morality. The morality of an act does NOT depend upon\nwhether politicians have given it their blessing via \"legislation.\"\n\nAs I've said before, the world looks very different when not viewed\nthrough \"authority\"-colored glasses. On one hand, many things get a\nlot simpler. On the other hand, you lose the intellectual cop-out\nof mass violence via \"government\" intervention as the default\nsolution to all problems, whether it be poverty, crime, illiteracy,\nsubstance abuse, or even those dadburn \"furriners\" coming here.\nDeal with them WITHOUT initiating violence, or stop pretending to\nbe pro-freedom.\n\nSincerely,\n\nLarken Rose\nwww.larkenrose.com",

Next those people will need to bring some supplies over the wall which will also be very difficult even for a person in excellent physical condition, this also takes a considerable length of time and if there is also surveillance on the wall Boarder Patrol will easily be able to catch them before they can enter.\nThe tunnel argument is laughable.\nDrug trafficking is the most profitable use for a tunnel, and so that will constitute the majority of the use of the tunnel. The drug cartels would not want to risk their investment of the tunnel on an enormous number of people that have no loyalties to the cartel. Other benefits of that model includes the fact that if the drugs are intercepted they will offer no clues as to where the tunnel is, and the people transporting the drugs will often times not even know where the tunnel as a way to insure that the tunnel will not be found. The drivers will only be told where the car that they are asked to drive is.",

Are there any plans yet proposing costs or are we assuming trump will get Mexico to pay for it? \n\nI’m against the wall because the drugs and weapons are much more commonly dished out to populations of civilians by big Pharma and Weapons dealers. Once we consider the act of using a drug like the prescription drugs as being wrong as a moral stand point and we re visit the statistical data to include consideration of the real % of drugs being sold to the people. We do that we see we have a much bigger internal issue than a wall. I’m all for keeping our at-15s but buddy is it not true every rampage sprit shooter is on psychoactive drugs? Every single last one of them? Is it Columbia’s cocaine that seems to be a common thread among sprit shooters or is it psychoactive drugs sold by the faction flying under the flag and protection of law? Who’s the bigger problem? Get to the root of school shootings or deal with the beans?",

You let the kid make his talking points, pointed them out in your handbook, and sent him on his way. With the wall, you let this guy just talk and talk, but don't challenge his points. HOW do we tax them? WHAT entry points if there are no borders? Etc.\nWe've heard all of these talking points before, they're nothing new to us. IMO what really made this show shine was you changing their minds, not the other way around.\nEDIT: Having gotten to watch the whole of 2 Genders Pt 2, that was phenomenal.

Turns out that there are over 68 countries with walls of various kinds and another 32 were in the construction or planning stages! Geeze...can’t we all “just get along”?  Nope, I have a fence around my property for a reason...my RIGHT to protect and KEEP what is mine, my fence (border) delineates the “enter at your own peril” zone, helps keep honest people HONEST and makes it quicker to easily identify those who have no respect for the law or BORDERS ...lines of demarcation that only are crossed by those who have no respect for the rights of others. If you ignore the signs that declare that, “If you are found here at night...you’ll be found here in the morning”, you do so by informed risk...not understanding English is not a valid excuse for ignoring the obvious universally understood symbolism of what fences and walls represent...NO ENTRY WITHOUT PERMISSION!!

Don't forget ladders and ropes. The wall is not only expensive, but highly symbolic.\n\nThe solution to this problem lies in the cause of the problem. The people who are coming here do so for a few reasons.\n\nOne of those reasons may revolve around government corruption. Dealing with the governments who create these environments would be a good start. It's akin to telling your neighbor to mow their lawn. Get your government together so that people aren't fleeing in terror and risking their lives to get here.\n\nAnother reason is FINANCIAL INCENTIVE. One important question to answer is WHO is giving them financial incentive.\n\nFarmers, businessmen, and the wealthy [like Trump], who do not want to pay an American living wage. It seems that they're reaping the benefits of this labor, and then throwing those illegal immigrant workers under the bus when they're done with them.\n\nTaking those who provide incentive and holding their feet to the fire, and even fining them, would be a great start. Unfortunately, this will never happen, for the wealthy tend to not punish the wealthy. If they did, then America would have locked up a lot of bankers a decade ago.\n\nIf America ends up getting a wall, then you can bet that the wealthy will be installing doors for added convenience.\n\nWould YOU pick lettuce for what they earn? I'm sure they couldn't even afford to buy lettuce for what they are paid. It's back-breaking work, and I don't know anyone who would do it for what they are paying.\n\nMaybe they'll turn to child labor and pay them cash. Who knows.\n\nIn summary, corrupt governments need to be addressed, and the wealthy need to be informed that it is no longer acceptable to hire illegals and to give them incentives to come here.\n\nCorrupt governments don't address other corrupt governments, and the wealthy do not punish others who are wealthy. So what we'll end up getting is a very expensive symbolic gesture that is a wall.",

You gloss over this like it's a non-issue, unfortunately, due to things like, i don't know, morals, it is.\n\nYou know what's even worse?  Saying that the wall is an \"encouragement for citizenship\".  Never before has this worked, and it won't work this time, the only way this is going to go is a violent path where people end up getting shot or arrested at the border.  Do you want to know why?  Because illegal immigrants weren't able to get citizenship in the first place, that's why they're illegal.  A wall is going to solve their problems and they're going to get magical citizenship from thin air I suppose, I mean fine, get rid of them, but more will still come and try, resulting in violence.\n\nAnd where are the funds for this wall coming from exactly?  I guess healthcare for all is a stupid evil socialist concept, but a wall, that will cost billions to build and billions more to maintain and patrol is a good use of money?  Sounds great!!\n\nTalking of money, what is the economical impact going to be on the country when you get rid of all those illegal immigrants taking the jobs you don't want?  You do realise that illegal immigrants, if anything, are taken advantage of by businesses.  They're literally referred to as the building blocks of your economy man! \n- https://digitalcommons.chapman.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&context=honors_student_work\n\nMaybe I'm getting too worked up here, but my god!  Really?  Really?  You want to build a wall?  To what end?  This isn't the middle fucking ages!  I suppose you're going to start throwing hot oil over the top next yeah?  That'll stop them!   Maybe then they'll be able to get the citizenship which you're making nearly impossible to get!  This 'Encouragement for citizenship' line is simply a cover for the dark truth, if they leave, they won't have the chance to legally become a citizen, and part of me thinks that you would be just fine with that.\n\nP.S.  Change my mind?  You never intended to change your mind, you just want to 'win' the debate - against unprepared people.",

The drugs coming to the USA are either coming through the border or below it.\n\n I used to cross every day to go to work when I was living in Mexico, waiting in line 1 to 3 hours, for 4 years, and I think I saw like 3 or 4 people jumping the border (well, trying,  fortunately the BP's were able to catch them).\n\nIt would be awesome if a simple wall could stop the overflow of illegals, but most come legally.

No one is saying that immigrants (legally or illegally) are saying lazy but illegal immingrants are criminals by the very nature of breaking the US law by crossing the border illegally.  I know that large corporations support the illegal immigrants due to the fact of wanting low wage workers.  Here's a thought.....maybe pay low income Americans a living wage and forgo immigrant employment.  Help your own people out.  You can deport the illegal immigrants if you really wanted to.  It is your country.  That's like saying that the immigration problem in Europe is so out of control that there is no hope for controlling it but again that's not true.  That's wimping out......take control.  I'm from Canada and we have our own immigration problem occuring since Trudeau and I feel it is our resposibility to speak out and act towards stomping on this problem.",

A wall might help prevent some illegal immigration, but the percentage of illegal immigrants who get in by just overstaying their visa makes the cost to build the wall not worth it to most people. Like everything, there are pluses and minuses on either side. For example, agricultural work utilizes massive amounts of illegal immigrants. As an opposing example, illegal immigrants tend to bring in more drugs and crime, as you stated, but possibly the reason for that is they cannot gain legal citizenship easily, and would rather resort to illegal activity to make a buck. So, by making citizenship easier to obtain, we could keep the types of illegal immigrants that would be good for this country, and crack down on those who still refuse to acquire citizenship even when it's possible for them to do so. TLDR: Find a middle ground. Create faster, non-exclusive routes to U.S citizenship, and THEN deal with the remainder.",

Conservative in their views on immigration, abortion, fiscal matters, social reform and so on.  \n\nBut what may surprise you, and I’m hoping someone from louder with Crowder reads this because it something that most people in our community(conservatives trying to provide an alternative media source) are unaware of. The fake news is not only present in the English-speaking media but it is 100 times worse on networks such as Univision and Telemundo.\n\nI don’t mean anything ugly by this, but my experience tells me that this woman speaks very little English and completely understands even less. I would bet dollars to donuts that most of her news, and the media she consumes comes from networks like Telemundo and Univision.\n\nUnlike CNN and MSNBC Telemundo and Univision do not just bend a convenient version of the truth and their reporting they out right lie. My wife tells me, she’s the one that speaks Spanish, that on regular basis reporters like Jorge Ramos tell the viewers that if the wall succeeds they will be unable to visit their family ever again. They tell them on a regular basis that President Trump and the Republicans want to deport Hispanics who are already US citizens. They tell them that if the wall goes up we will no longer allow anybody from Mexico to come here For any reason. They told them before the election, Those that are in the process of becoming residents and or citizens, that is President Trump is elected, no matter what part of the process they were in that they would be deported was no grounds.\n\nNo this lady may genuinely be against building the wall. But judging by how confused she was, and just the way she was talking I’m willing to bet she was a victim of some of this fake news.\n\nIt’s my sincere hope that somebody whether it be louder Crowder or someone like them will begin to expose how bad this really is. My wife and I have considered doing it ourselves, and upon further research can find nobody of like mind who haven’t drank the Democratic Kool-Aid.\n\nIt’s incredible to me how many Hispanic people vote Democrat, when in my experience, None of them seem to hold any democratic values.\n\nPlease excuse my spelling and grammar, I’m on a mobile device and I used voice text to put this together",

If not then zero tolerance deportation is the other choice they get",

That's not even taking into account the fact that people can just fly over the damn wall anyway. The wall is a garbage idea for reasons that have nothing to do with immigration.

It's no surprise that most people willing to jump into a random conversation with a stranger regarding hot button issues aren't the most well spoken bunch.

As for illegal immigration problem, mass majority of that comes from air travel, i and I don’t think going to build a wall to stop air travel.  Most illegal immigration occurs from good intentions.  Such as over staying one’s visa or traveling legally into the nation for a day trip or shopping trip to not return. \n\n3. A lot of the frown upon stuff occurs beyond those people’s control, by that I meaning cartels forcing seemingly innocent people into illegal actions.  And sometimes people spend life savings on fleeing their nation and country because of real danger.  \n\n——I don’t disagree, we have a serious problem, but I feel like a wall isn’t a solution, maybe a metaphorical wall... but a real physical wall is nothing more than a cod piece for trump to show off about.

Hey, but at least he tried to make sense and sound educated. He’ll need that when he runs for governor of NM. The look that Crowder gave the camera was perfect. “WTF did I just hear?",

If it was easier and cheaper, people would be doing it that way more often. You think people would rather walk across a desert to get here? Get real. \n\nYou say Trump did not disrespect Mexicans, that is just not true. He literally said that Mexico is sending over their 'bad hombres'. He called Mexicans drug dealers, kidnappers, and rapists. You posted this video yesterday, so you must know about what is going on at the border. ICE is separating kids from their parents, and there have been reports of ICE agents raping some of the girls. Should we not let them in our country either? All of a sudden sounds like Trump and ICE are the kidnappers, rapists, and 'bad hombres'. \n\nThen you want to say how illegal immigrants contribute the most to homicides. Yet, every time I turn on the TV, it's a white kid shooting up a school or church or a white man shooting up a concert. Moreover, these statistics are skewed because it is definitely proven, and said by police officers, that they are trained to target people of color. Look around in jails/prisons, most people are not white. Black people are incarcerated at a rate 5 times higher than whites. Guaranteed they do the same with Hispanics/Latinos. \n\nI understand that safety is one of the top priorities for America, as it is essential to maintain our country. However, it is dishonest and fundamentally wrong to give these garbage reasons to build a wall. People think that if the wall is built all of a sudden all of these problems are going to go away. Regardless, drugs and illegal immigrants will always find a way in. It just seems to me that Trump and his supporters only want the wall built because it'll be seen as a 'victory' for America. Not to mention the symbolism that a wall will imply. This is contradictory to the way humanity is heading. Love, unity, sustainability, and knowledge is what we need. This just sets us back.",

Many endangered animals species live along the U.S Mexican border. Blocking access for these would have serious impacts on animal populations. Animals on the Mexican side would be prevented from breeding with animals on the U.S side, which would reduce genetic diversity and weaken already small and sparse populations. Human activities have led and are leading to the decline in biodiversity, healthy ecosystems, and the natural world. These things are taken for granted, and won't be replacable if we destroy it. I don't have a problem with securing the border and preventing illegal immigration, but a wall across a one thousand mile border just seems ridiculous.",

The current wall works. There is no need for a bigger or stronger wall. My suggestion is to have more border patrol agents monitoring the borders.  Besides there are some places that is impossible to build the wall, such as high mountains ,steep mounts or just hard terrain. CBP knows that they can't build one continuous wall.  Also there are a lot of US private properties that intersect with the wall and in these places, the US gov. can't build anything. So there are gaps anyways. I won't argue about the kind of people coming in to the US and their intentions because I don't have the data for that. In conclusion, a NEW (note my emphasis in NEW) wall is just a massive waste of money, instead, the US should hire more border patrol agents and have better technology for surveillance. \n\nHere is a page with statistics regarding the US illegal immigration.  https://www.statista.com/statistics/646261/unauthorized-immigrant-population-in-the-us/  It has data up until 2014, but it gives an idea of how it has been reducing since 2007 (the year the border wall was built). The wall reduced the influx of illegals from 12 million to 11 million and it has fluctuated ever since, but stayed as 11 million. DHS should focus on the \"virtual wall\" as the CBP calls it, not on physical walls.",

I stood firm on my belief that NO they should not- the main reason being that they are ILLEGAL immigrants. Why should they be given the rights and privileges given to actual law abiding American citizens when in the first place, by being here ILLEGALLY, they are breaking he law?! Of course the one girl that was on the “agree” side started crying and told a heart breaking personal story so I looked like the bad guy. 🙄 ridiculous!!!!!",

The going wage for framing houses there, last time I checked, was $10-15/ hour, 15 being the highest I saw.

Which is a stupid point, had we started building a wall 10 years ago we wouldn’t be having the issues we have today.    \n\nMy only issue with the wall I wonder if it needs to be so expensive.  Look at the wall Hungary built, it is effective.  Why shouldn’t we model a fence like Hungarys using a lower cost fence with sensors which detect foot traffic, cameras, drones.  I wonder why a Hungary type fence would not work here.  In Hungary it is also felony with stiff prison terms for damaging the fence.",

    "commentText": "Here I'll give you a good reason why building a wall is pointless. These people will avoid  the wall if it becomes too much a deterrent which leads the sea routes open to get used, or they smuggle people like they have been through trucks. Having the sea route cross it would be much more heartbreaking for when migrants boat across in the thousands and half of them die in stormy conditions vs them trying to get in through known passages.  Unless we will also have a sea wall built too which will disrupt ship trading too or we will have more boarder watching with the coastal guards. These people are desperate to cross the boarder to escape something that we do not understand. I think we need to find out why they are crossing and see what we can do to aid their situation for the real solution. Why are we not seeing Canadians crossing our boarders as much as the Mexicans. Obviously something is wrong there. But in the end this could be an issue with capitalism as they go to the places where labor is the cheapest and in Mexico they have some dirt cheap labor.\n\nAlso unfortunately the guys response about an xray boarder will not prevent someone from leaving their tag away from them or taken it out how do we detect these people then? You got to do something to prevent it cause once someone finds a way to break something that word spreads. Even with a written response now you need someone to read so you do need some border agency to do that job. Then there is the other implementations of not having a boarder now the US will send it's army to Mexico cause boarders are a non existent thing and will only start up conquest in the modern day and fights about who owns what part of land. That and plus I don't think many of these people understand that most migrants that come here SEND money back to Mexico. So now we are losing that money that are not going back into our economy and being sent to a different one that is a parasite and it is only going to keep growing. \n\nHere is a benefit though a lot of our GDP comes from economic migrants buying Americans goods cause they are extremely cheap here vs the extremely high taxed items that they sell there on the black markets. So some of our GDP comes from these migrants who vacation and fund their vacation through buying goods that are expensive and under cuts their markets there because of high taxes. I've talked to hundreds of people like this they tend to buy gaming consoles and technology when they do this cause those are items that are highly taxed on.",

That is most definitely not helping the US economy but rather helping the Mexico economy.",

To address this concern, Martinez, Lee, and Nielsen (2004) studied drug and homicide crime in Miami, Florida, and San Diego, California, to determine if there is a relationship between violent crime and immigration. Although both cities have a large Hispanic and immigration population, Martinez et al. found that foreign-born persons were not responsible for the communities’ drug and violent crime. The increase in crime was associated with second-generation youth, who were more likely to be involved in homicides related to drug offending in both communities. According to the researchers, “segmented assimilation” among second-generation youth can explain criminal patterns, since Mexican American youth in poor neighborhoods, despite cultural assimilation, committed violent crimes. If, however, immigrant families had economic stability (e.g., jobs), their offspring were not likely to engage in drug-related homicides.\n\nMartinez, Stowell, and Lee (2010) analyzed the relationship between homicide and immigration in San Diego during periods of major increases in the foreign-born population (1980–2000). They wanted to test the “immigrant paradox.” The paradox is that despite social disorganization theory’s prediction that people living in socially disorganized neighborhoods will have higher crime rates, communities with large immigrant populations have lower levels of crime. Martinez et al. posited that immigrants exhibit strong social controls (education and mental health attributes) and rejuvenate neighborhoods that had been previously considered to be high-crime inner-city communities. While the researchers found that socially disorganized neighborhoods experienced increases in homicides, they also found that, when communities had an influx of immigrants, there were fewer homicides. Their findings suggest that while certain neighborhoods foster crime, if recent immigrants settle in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods, the impact on the violent crime rate can be nullified.\n\nVélez (2009) studied homicide offenses in Chicago. She compared city neighborhoods that had dense populations of white, Hispanic, and African American residents and the homicide rates within these neighborhoods and found that homicide rates are significantly higher in African American neighborhoods and are closely associated with neighborhoods with a “concentrated disadvantaged” population. Neighborhoods with concentrated disadvantage are those with a large percentage of residents with incomes below the poverty line, limited employment of residents age 16 and older, many female head of household families, and high unemployment. She found that, in areas where there were large populations of recent immigrants, the number of homicides decreased. Vélez attributed this finding to the reinvigoration of neighborhoods when new immigrants arrived. She suggested that the new arrivals arguably want to strengthen ties with their neighbors, increase community organizations, and improve the local economy.\n\nSampson, Morenoff, and Raudenbush (2005) analyzed data for Chicago between 1995 and 2002 to determine if ethnic and racial differences in neighborhoods account for residents’ engaging in violence. They found that age, recent immigration status, and ethnicity matters when analyzing crimes of violence. Youth in all race and ethnic groups are more likely to engage in violence, and the level of violence peaks at ages 17 or 18. In addition, they found that recent immigrants engaged in less violence than their offspring; third-generation immigrants had higher levels of violence than second-generation, and second-generation immigrants had higher levels of violence than first-generation immigrants. When considering race and ethnicity, African Americans had higher levels of violence than whites, and whites had higher levels of violence than Mexican Americans, even when controlling for neighborhood composition. Neighborhoods matter: if a neighborhood had a higher level of violence prior to changed social demographics (changes in the immigrant population), then the odds that persons in the neighborhood would engage in violence were significantly higher than in other neighborhoods.\n\n\n\nArrest, sentencing, and incarceration rates have been changing in the late the 20th and early 21st centuries. Since reaching an all-time high in both violent and property crime in the mid-1990s, the number and rate of violent and property crime in the United States have been steadily declining (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2015a), while the incarceration rate, until very recently, had been increasing. According to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report (2015), arrests decreased 20% between 2005 and 2015; between 2013 and 2014, violent crime arrests decreased 0.2%, and property crime arrests decreased 4.3%. In 2014, more offenders were arrested for drug crimes (1,561,231) than property crimes (1,553,980) and violent crimes (498,666) (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2015b). The states with the highest violent and property crime rates neither are the most populous nor house the largest number of immigrants. In 2015, the states with the highest reported crime rates were: Louisiana, Alabama, Alaska, Tennessee, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Arkansas, Delaware, and Missouri (Frohlich, Stebbins, & Sauter, 2015). In the United States, places with the largest increases in population have been associated with the largest decreases in crime rates in the past decade. The majority of arrestees in 2014 were white (69%) and male (73%) (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2015c). In sampled U.S. cities, Stowell, Messner, McGeever, and Raffalovich (2009) found that as the foreign-born, immigrant population in the cities went up, the violent crime rate went down\n\nREAD MORE AT and cherrypick as you like:\n\nhttp://criminology.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264079.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264079-e-93",

In my experience the vast majority of people aren't avoiding legal status to not pay taxes, but rather because the path to legal status is too difficult and too expensive. The concept of the wall is a bit ridiculous to me. The majority of illegal immigration happens when people fly over, a wall will do nothing to stop that. You mention without a wall that there would be no way to identify people but checkpoints are currently in place. People that circumvent those checkpoints I imagine do it because they wouldn't be allowed through them. Sure, there are criminals that would like to avoid taxes and commit crimes, but I would argue that most of them are honest people that want to make a living. An easier path to legal status would negate the reason yo avoid said checkpoints and people could enter legally. The concept of an average person having to constantly be on their best behavior to not get deported just so they don't have to pay taxes seems a bit ridiculous. The wall would be ridiculously expensive that American citizens would have to pay for. Simply make that path to legal status simple and then all the undocumented immigrants can become legal and start paying taxes. Those that refuse to do so should be deported. But I don't think that the people that are currently being deported are given an option for citizenship before being deported.",

The numbers he’s referring to at 6:27 are only for federal sentencing and can be found here, (https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/annual-reports-and-sourcebooks/2017/Table09.pdf).  This high rate is likely due to the fact that many crimes that would normally be prosecuted in state courts are referred to ICE if they are committed by illegal immigrants.  Notice that this is a sample of, for example, 72 murders, way lower than the thousands reported by the FBI.\n\nLooking at crime in Texas, we can look at this study by the Cato Institute demonstrates that illegal immigrants commit fewer crimes that native Americans, and legal immigrants are FAR lower, (https://www.cato.org/publications/immigration-research-policy-brief/criminal-immigrants-texas-illegal-immigrant).  There are lots of other studies that have similar finding, though it is still too understudied to draw high confidence conclusions nationally.  Crowder should really drop the point about illegal immigrants committing more crimes since at best it’s unproven and at worst it untrue.",

    "commentText": "So the main reason immigrants come to the United States is because their country is shit, plain and simple. The government is corrupt, cops get paid off by criminals and get away with whatever they want. They’re just tired of living in that type of environment so they choose to come to America for a better life. That being said, yes there will be criminals who want to leave as well and fuck them for ruining it for all the hard working immigrants who for most part never committed a crime in their life. I believe in a secure border but not the way it’s being done right now. Like the guy said, they will always find a way around it. It’s a waste of money building such a massive structure. It might help for a little while but eventually they’ll find a way trust me. My solution is something I really hadn’t heard people talk about so let me know what y’all think. But what Ive been thinking is basically instead of worrying so much on stopping immigrants coming all together, why not help the reason why they’re coming in the first place. Why not help Mexico with their infamous drug cartels? They’re the ones bringing in the drugs and ruining both countries. This is America’s issue just as it’s Mexicos. Not to mention the cartels are basically terrorist themselves. America already helps every other country with issues like these why not help the neighbor that’s causing so many issues? You can’t tell me the United States Army or Marines couldn’t handle a couple of cartels. We have the best army in the world don’t we? Why not use them to help secure our borders against the real criminals. That way people won’t be so inclined to leave their country. Because guess what, they love their country. They don’t leave because they hate it, they hate the situation it’s in right now but they would rather much be in their home land where they’re not judged or feel attacked by others.",

Taking what he said about 37% of murders being commited by illegal immigrants who are 3.5% of the population , lets do the math shall we? Doing some simple google searches the U.S population is 325×10^6 (325 million) , so that would mean that 11.4^6 (11.4 million) are illegal immigrants . Alright next using the amount of homicides committed in 2016 (tried to find 2017s couldn't find it though) there were 17250 murders , and 37% of that is. 6382.5 murders. Meaning that 6382.5 murders where commited by illegal immigrants , now assuming that one person is killed per murderer , 11.4×10^6 people  divided by 6382.5 murders equals 1786 people per 1 murder , Meaning that 1 out of 1786 commit 1 murder . We can also divided the amount of murders by people to see the murders commited per person. 6382.5 divided by 11.4×10^6 equals 5.59×10^-4 (5.59 times 10 raised to the negative 4th power) murder commited per person , so we can see from this that sure if this stat is true (which I don't know ) we see that the vast majority of illegal immigrants are not murderers!! And don't let anyone try and scare you with stats that are Very misleading do the math your self its ,not hard i literally only had to google the U.s population and murders commited in 2016",

As you may already know many Mexicans have nurtured a hatred inside them towards Trump mainly because democrats and all the corrupt politicians from Mexico have poisoned our minds telling us that an open border is our only hope (deviating all atention away from them since they are the ones damaging mexican economy and making migration the only hope of many). Well i heard rumors about Russia seeking to enforce their relationship with mexico (taking advantage of Mexico's point of view towards Trump and his policies) to the point of bringing their bases with artillery to Mexican soil. This would of course create jobs and improve our economy but tension between Mexico and US would increase. Many see this as a payback to the US for the mistreatment received by imigrants from the new government. What do you think the US should do? Treat imigrants better? Amnesty? What restrains Mexico from making deals with Russia? Its now weak relation with tge US? Do you see any posibility of war if this happens? I really want to hear your opinion guys.",

I think most reasonable Americans would agree with having a secure border, but we shouldn't conflate those whom intentionally avoid checkpoints/customs with those that stayed here beyond their Visa. The path to citizenship is an arduous one, especially after 9/11, and we should work on improving, shortening, and making it more accessible to hard working immigrants that came here to pursue American successes.\n\nAs for an actual physical wall, what is the cost-benefit on that? Would we even get a return on our investment? It doesn't seem likely at all. How much would the wall as a symbol alone hurt the United States with South American relations, not to mention the message it sends to any potential immigrant from that region. I am not trying to put a price on an American life, I'm trying to say that there are much more cost efficient ways to secure a border than to build a wall across 3,000 kilometers.",

That makes up for 0.065% of illegal immigrants will commit homicide. Or about 6 in 10.000, you are punishing 9.994 people in 10.000 for 6 bad apples.

The press will be insane by this point. The whole world will be tuning in to see if the ICE agents will really go thru with it. Finally some unlucky illegals arrive.a live chase and ICE captures the illegals. The terror is palpable. They are rounded up and put into a prepared fenced chute. All that is left is to feed the first dozen random illegal crossers, men, women, children,babys and the coyotes that guide them into the hopper at gunpoint. A conveyor belt begins to turn and the illegals move toward the grinder. The press is incensed! Tv ratings and live streams hit record numbers. The screams are heartbreaking. The first falls into the rotating blades and is jettisoned as a fine mist of flesh and bone. One after the other, they fall and are blown out the exit as stew. The press is screaming, one reporter is puking her guts out onto her Manolo Blahnik shoes. The cameras are shaking and pointing at random things to stem the horror. A man with an impeccable suit and dead eyes walks out of a government car and up to one of the cameras. He says, “ the government of the USA has decided to take a hard line against crime. There will be no more illegal immigration, that goes for those that are already here, you have 48 hours to vacate the country. We will not be taking questions at this time.”\n\nIt will take over a week to prove that it’s was a hoax, but by then, the problem will have been solved, and for a lot of the world, they will never, ever, believe it WAS a hoax.\nProblem solved.

For example, CIS reports that non-citizens (not just undocumented immigrants) commits 8.9 percent of homicides. Even Fox News only reported about 12% (with this dubious disclaimer \"In the absence of comprehensive data, FoxNews.com examined a patchwork of local, state and federal statistics\").

I am in support of some process or background check to prevent those who could pose a threat from entering our country (Not those smuggling drugs or weapons, the government should not regulate consumption of goods). For example, immigrants from Islamic origins who have potential to carry out terrorist action would be denied entrance to our country.

Americans are already the most poorly traveled people on the planet. Having a physical manifestation of xenophobia, which is what a wall on the border would become would ultimately make Americans even less likely to travel. \nBasically,  my concern for the wall is it would become a control mechanism for the people on the inside.",

God help New Mexico if he becomes governor.\n-Initially he just suggested a system where people pass through a system to get citizenship so we know they are here and they are being taxed properly as citizens.......we have that. The wall is to stop the millions who don't want to do that.\n-He clearly didn't process the disproportionate crime statistics\n-Obviously open borders would not work, how can anyone think that\n-Every country, including Mexico, has immigration laws and rules and sentences for illegal immigration. Why is it only a problem when the U.S. does it. And its not about Mexicans, its about illegal immigrants. We as the U.S. just happen to border Mexico and thats where most of our illegal immigration comes from.\n-If you want to have a conversation about the immigration processes, how long it takes, the conditions of the holding areas as we're seeing currently, thats fine. But how can you not support a wall. You can still come in legally.\n-Many Mexicans are hard working people and I sympathize with many, especially those with children, who want a better life here. But we HAVE to have rules, just like every other country.\n-Yes I believe changes need to be made in the holding areas right now, children shouldn't be in these conditions because they are innocent. We also have to remember that Mexico and their government are shit and need to get their country together so massive amounts of people aren't trying to leave. Also you know what you are getting into if you bring your child and break the law. You are walking them right into a holding cell. Again, that being said, its not the children's fault and they don't deserve poor conditions.\n- 13:14 lol\n\nI realize I'm preaching to the choir in this comment section but I had to vent.",

But I think we can certainly have an interesting conversation regarding this. \n\n\"So i am an immigrant under the standard process it took 14 yrs to become a citizen but you know what, we did it was hard, a lot of paperwork and reconfirmation of info etc.but we showed our worth.\n\nThis thing about the kids, them poor kids, here is the deal the illegal parents are at fault. they never set up a way to legalize themselves to become contributing to society under valid means. the democrats that where in office built this bill, they  are the ones splitting the families, oh and the lack of responsibility from the parent to do things the right way. \n\nSo why is illegal immigration wrong? well other than it building a sub class of people it creates a new category of demeaning. these people are desperate to the point of doing anything and being subjected to abuse because of their status. Who do you think make up the largest portion of child trafficking? the ones you can manipulate easily because of their status and because they need money.\n\nfurther more they pose an economic weight as money is funneled out, mind you the value we give money here in the states is different outside the country after all, it is exchanged when it if funneled out of the country. as a result those that receive it drain resources from the country, no not ours but their own. you see the work is done here the value of work is money which recirculates in the states in exchange for goods. when this money is exchanged for other monetary value outside the states, does the money help produce work and function in their economy??? NO, think about it this way if the country doesn't produce work or pay sufficiently then what you are creating is a community that leaches but doesn't give back to the country. as a result its a dysfunctional economy that becomes more impoverished. This in turn promotes the cartel since they \"provide\" jobs fro the impoverished and as such become the law. \n\nThese people dont see that, they see the hardships and desperation produced from the funneling and in turn only promote the state of decay in those countries, by escaping and halting the growth from where they come from. \n\nWe do not have a system to help them. Maybe educating and sending them back might work but there is nothing to go back to since the comfort of the states is far more pleasing. I feel for these people, but they dont see the mistakes. to promote the growth of a country people willing to make it grow must be there to create the opportunity, to innovate and grow. \n\nThis is my 2 cents, its not racism and its not a lack of humanitarianism. this is the combination of poor judgement and poor policy making and though its tearing families what is the better option struggle or some degree of comfort. Many of us grew up in a state of comfort with water, electricity, food, medicine, all available at the tip of your fingers, can you say with total honesty that though the conditions are harsh for these kids that the outcome is not better than they would be with their parents?\n\nAs to a solution, we cant repeat DACA as the result has been disastrous, what we need is a clear cut method to establish green cards in a safe methodical way as to provide work while influencing local expenditure and provide incentive to return to where they came to help there. this is hard but if the USA is to help and avoid getting deeper into the ethics behind the immigration problem we need to influence growth where they derive from.\"",

The wall would raise taxes and cost way to much money for it to be worth it. for my first point if you have never heard of that before let me explain what happens. a huge percent of illegal immigrants get a tourist visa or any visa that allows them to enter legally. When it expires they just stay in the country. The numbers are alittle sketchy but its somewhere between 40 and 50 percent. could be even higher but 40 - 50 is the best and safest bet. it makes no sense to make the American people pay for a wall that wont stop illegal immigration. all it will do is force illegal immigrants to arrive on a visa and just let it expire. yes it will erase the issue of border jumping but wont stop illegal immigration in the slightest (ok probably a little but not a huge amount at all)",

But why is this desirable?”\nNo, not because “diversity” is our greatest value. No, not because Big Business needed cheap labor. And no, Madison asserted, “Not merely to swell the catalogue of people.

I would agree with the young man in the white about no need for international borders IF there were no government handouts to be had -- which are begotten through confiscation by the government of its citizens' personal property. The income tax must be abolished and along with it government dole. But as long as Americans vote for Socialism, whether by electing the Communist Socialist Democrat Party or the less-Socialist-but-still-Socialist Republican Party, there will be income tax and redistribution of wealth, and with it waves of immigrants looking to the U.S. government for subsistence, and therefore a wall becomes a necessary expediency. In other words, I could argue against the wall if my first demand was met: Abolish the income tax.\nLook at it this way, pigeons will flock to the man sitting in the park throwing popcorn.

For some reason this didn’t bother her, but the rest of the family was pretty upset.  My uncle hired a private investigator (behind my cousin’s back, we were afraid she’d do something crazy like run off with the guy) to find out more about him & HE WAS WANTED FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER IN BRAZIL.  Of course we contacted ICE, but it took an entire year to get them to pick him up & send his ass home.  We were shocked by how slowly everything moved.  We had his name, address, daily schedule (shocker - he didn’t work), & it still took so long.  I can’t imagine other cases where the people are a bit more slippery....",

And how are they going to identify as Americans if they can't even identify with the culture they've been a part of for hundreds of years? But the biggest joke is he thinks the criminals and also the poor and illiterate are going to pay taxes.",

How come the rest of the world has no problem enforcing their borders? because illegal migrants know they'll have their teeth kicked in for fucking with them. why not respond with asking why every other country is not required to be relaxed with migrants? why are they allowed to maintain near 100% racial purity and close down legal and illegal immigration? why have we watched our country decrease from near 90% european in the 70's to sub 60% with that number on a fast trajectory down. When the demographics put migrants in the majority position - ask them how they plan to treat whites? the group that crowder is not allowed to talk about have organized a stand-down of the border - and will  be in an even greater position of power as they giggle at the destruction of their long-time cultural enemy.

Building a wall isn’t going to stop “Immigrants” or “immigration; building a wall is just going to stir things up a notch, a it’s getting people to act accordingly. * not in a good way * instead of building walls trump should use that money, wealth for the people and schools and cities all around the nation that are in great poverty. What ever ethnicity you are, if you’re not Native... you’re an immigrant to this land your self... nobody had a wall up or had intentions of a wall being built when “ancestors” ran through America like “ if it were theirs “ yeah some might be criminals, yeah some are hard working, but what people fail to realize is that some are doing as they please, committing crimes, and forgetting why they came here. Only because already “ u.s. Citizens “ are showing to them that they don’t even care about rules and regulations. So what would people do ? Follow the leaders “ legal U.S. citizens “.  Whites, Blacks, Asians, Latinos,Muslims, alll commit crime on a regular, and we aren’t getting the same treatment, at this point there’s just somethings against them, I’m a proud u.s. citizen but I’m not proud on how this nation put things together.",

Also might be a good way to get these lazy uslelles millenials employed teach them some actual trades like heavy equipment operation welding masonry shut like that while on project.\n\nThat my friends is an easy ducking selk to the American people and Congress then see how that plays out start on highest traffic areas first chain link and drone lowest traffic areas and go back to Congress down the road if we have budget shortfalls and need some help \n\nAnd if you really wanna get fancy gwy arpu to hall some of his guys over to help dig and such seems fitting that illegals would have to help build the wall also and that shit would drive libtards to suicide I'm sure it even better make them buts enough to cometey blowing up the wall the they get arrested and raped in prison by the very same people they are cheerleading for\n\nNow matter how you slice this thing its winning",

Trump's wall is silly because it is not cost effective, the reality of it's effectiveness to stop illegal immigration would come down to ultimately how many border protection officers are employed (not just at the border but at all points of entry to the USA) and how well they are resourced and trained, which is the same situation without the wall.",

Otherwise, the more likely device would be an RFID worn or carried in the wallet or purse like an ID by LEGAL immigrants (because an ILLEGAL immigrant is LEAST likely to enter a Government facility for this) who can conveniently go in and out of facilities, also back and forth over the border quite easily. It'd be VERY easy to determine who is and isn't legal (read: with RFID=Legal or without RFID=Illegal). Why stop there, the same thing could be applied to various other regions of the general population to regulate crime and citizenry because, if done through the \"appropriate channels\", the RFID would be difficult to counterfeit. Of course, such a sensible and rational thing would never actually occur...what with the beLIEf in such silly nonsense like the \"mark of the beast\" and end times \"profitsy\" which will OBVIOUSLY occur SOON and not like some far off thousands-of-years-from-NOW nonsense...making it that much easier to talk about...and trace any indirect influence directly back to this comment.",

How will he be the governor of n.m if there are no borders how will there be a new Mexico?.. But that's just tongue and cheek.. My real contention to his view comes from the fact that you think that these illegals will circulate money into the economy...when in fact I've worked three jobs in the last 3 years with illegals here in Texas Every last one if them that's about 15 individual employees had family in their home country who they would send 75 to 80 percent of their check too... they we're making around 2k bi weekly... So in fact majority of the  money we send to these people they send to their home country and their home counties economy is being boosted while we go further into debt..not to mention the discrimination Americans are receiving because we won't work as cheap as the illegals would...and we need things like benefits, dental, health care, that ultimately gets niched because an illegal could care less for work benefits..also at every one of these jobs inculdingbthe one I work in now...all of these people are paid full checks in cash \n..while Americans are paid in tax deductible checks...I could go on and on because I personally first hand work with illegals.they aren't bad people they just don't see how they are causing major problems for hardworking Americans that want to Work a job in which they don't need Google translate to speak with upper management.",

Makes sense. I should not get access if I’m a gang member etc... Why should it be any different at the boarder... The Wall will work the same as the secured airport... I find it funny that many left people call us white People privileged. But I still must follow the laws, but illegal immigrants thinks they don’t have to? So the question is. Who is really the entitled one? And if I must apply for Visa, green card etc etc to live in the US and follow the laws of the country. Then why is it too much to ask illegal immigrants do the same... Just because they come from a poor state does that entitle them to bend or avoid the law of the country they are moving to... In my book applying for citizenship is the civilized way to do it. And it makes it easier for countries to sort the “bad apples” from the good... But I guess I’m a racist for even thinking this, according to the left... Let me just ask this. When you leave your home when you go to work. Do you lock your door and why? In order to prevent unwanted criminals from breaking in and robbing your house ofc... Kinda the same with boarders. Sure even when locked people can break in. But it is hell of a lot harder than if the door was just open.",

These people are just looking for a better life, they deserve to live in America and receive all the Government benefits that come with that. They should be given food stamps, housing, healthcare, cell phone with internet, and access to education. These are all human rights, and all people should be given them regardless of where they happen to be born. It's not there fault that they were born in some shitty country in South America, so it's there right to come to America and be given these things. If we have to tax more of the middle class and upper class to pay for all this then that's ok, they have to much money as it is. These people who need it, should have that money go to them in the form of Government assistance. If they can't work they should also be given a basic income on top of all the other benefits, like I said before these are human rights......",

Other countries defend their borders I just don't know why people think it's wrong that we defend ours. And if they cross illegally we should do the same thing other countries do minimum prison sentences and then after they're done with their prison sentence Deport them yes that would cost us tax dollars to put them in prison but it would be cheaper than what we're doing right now by allowing thousands upon thousands of them a month that are crossing to live here in sanctuary cities.

I saw another commenter say it comes down to \nCost\nEffectiveness \nPerception\nAnd i agree except i dont know what they mean by perception. First and foremost, the most important aspect is effectiveness. 40%+ (40 is the low ball) of illegal immigrants come by plane and over stay visa's, even other republican say its a dumb idea. To build a wall along 1900+ miles of the border is insanely pricey for such an inefficient wall. Shoot wouldnt surprise me if a bunch are coming in by car legally and doing the same as those who come by plane. Lastly mexican (latin american) immigrants are actually productive to the economy because they handle the jobs no one else will, are actually highly  unlikely to commit crime when compared to native born(but more than legal immigrants) , and for the most part they bring a work ethic thats stronger than that found in other ethnic groups. Overall id say i disagree. Im not pro-illegal immigration because there is an issue with population growth being faster than economic growth, but a wall is a no go for me.",

If the wall is funded not by taxing the people then build it, Not an issue, I personally think that a bigger wall between the border wont change much, people come here desperatley other ways, some of which are by plane, few cross right through and another small amount through the sea. Im not against building a wall, im against getting taxed for building a wall that wont make much of a difference, there are roads with potholes that I'd rather get paved to use tax dollars on, pay the police better so they can do their jobs correctly and not be corrupt, which is an issue, not all cops are bad but that doesnt go to say that all cops are perfect either. The point I want to get accross is people think the wall will make the immigration situation better for them, but back in the U.S. where everyone in the comment section presumably lives, The economy would worsen due to high tax for a wall that wont change much. I dont want bad people in the country, sure a small percentage of immigrants and illegal immigrants commit crimes, but there are bad people in this world regardless of where they are from, some people seek refuge or assylum to get out of a country that they dont feel safe in, when the process takes over a decade to get someone accross the border correctly its likley thay those people dont want to wait that long, a few weeks maybe a few months but it shouldnt take years,just because it takes years to cross legally to stay is the reason people come to america illegally and stay, they pay taxes regardless a tax number was relased saying a few million people that were undocumented paid taxes and made up a percentage in the revenue, The only solution that I saw to have people prove that they could stay is the dreamers act, which grants undocumented citizens legal work, they pay taxes and work in the mean time, daca seemed to be the best way to solve the undocumented issue until people thought that it was just a special pathway for citizen ship, and thats pretty much what seeking assylum or refuge is, a special pathway to citizenship, if you have someone trying to kill you or being mistreated in one country that another one will take you in with open arms, im not against that either but people are only arguing about daca and the issues and \"loopholes\" in the program. Im going to leave it off with this, If the wall is independently funded, and not taxed build it, if you think that will help with illegal immigration, but if it will be taxed why should we have to pay for a wall thought up by a billionare who has no political background but is now president. Just like the video i want a debate and discussion, civil, No hate because thay will just make you seem like an ignorant person there for your points will be invalid and just childish, I want to know why the wall needs to happen if there is already a large metal fence blocking the border.",

Just look what Obama did and it was working kinda right, he put money in the hands of the mexican government and we were doing the dirty work not letting all those people cross to there stopping them in our south border without anybody making a hiss. But now we have all these leftist trying to help the scum from south america because \"mah pipo\" using childs as leverage for their propaganda. I can not emphasize how much I hate those people, they are just scum, they are criminals, they are dirty and now that I live somewhat next to the zone near the passage of \"The Beast\" train can see how fucked these peoples are.There may be good ones and a few exceptions but even my Grandpa being a working illegal immigrant there told me the same, they just like to make troubles, they are lazy, dirty, they steal and they kill for easy money because is not their land, nor their people, they have nothing to take care of.

The ancestors of the Spanish Americans have lived  there since the time of the Spanish Empire, as far back as the late 1600s. They were briefly citizens of Mexico, from 1821 - when Mexico won independence from Spain - until the end of the Mexican-American War in 1848. They became American citizens per the terms of the treaty that ended that war.\n\nWhen I lived in New Mexico, most Spanish Americans I talked to were proud of their heritage and held disparaging attitudes toward Mexicans in general. They did not want their traditions to be subsumed into the culture of the new immigrants, and they were not in favor of illegal immigration at all. Unless their attitudes have changed drastically in the last twenty years, I would assume Leroy’s opinions are not necessarily representative of Spanish Americans as a whole.",

These are people that most likely flew into the country and walls aren't all that effective against planes  and those that are that desperate to cross on foot will find away to climb, dig under or break through a wall that is too long to be watched at all times. Also leads to migrants making more dangerous risks. I live in the U K and we have miles of fucking oceans for a wall and yet a retarded amount of illegal immigrants. Drug runners will always find a way, that is just fact, I've heard of some using fucking submarines to get coke into the US so I don't think the smuggling argument for a wall is valid. I think the best solutions are streamlining the legal immigration process, maybe allowing entry for workers under a temporary social security while their permanent entrance is being processed with the likes of housing benefits and being tightly restricted until citizenship has been established . Secondly far harsher penalties for companies employing illegals. \nLike I said I'm English not amercian so genuinely curious what people think of these ideas and if something similar is already in effect",

    "commentText": "Ok so I'd be for the Wall, under one condition. The issue is drugs correct? Illegal Immigrants doing bad shit, so how about this, all immigrants are welcome to the U.S. if they speak both Spanish and English because I believe the U.S. should be a Spanish and English Dominant Country. Also they must know the laws of the U.S. So what would be the major catch right? The mother and children will become U.S. citizens right away granted the child goes to school and keeps up a 2.7 of higher G.P.A., and the mother is responsible for that child's education and the mother and children will be supported up to a certain decided extent complete with housing and groceries and internet etc... However all male immigrants over the age of 17 and fathers will begin working on cleaning up the U.S., basically hard labor and community service, they will be able to go home to see their families but must return to work as scheduled, they will not get paid, they will only be supported. If too many days is missed or they quit, there will be a warning and then a 2nd time with no reasonable explanation will result in prison time. (Anyone who has seen me comment before knows I want inmates to start working on cleaning up the environment in chain gangs, anyone who escapes will be put down even if caught again). Immigrants who start trouble such as drug dealing or starting fights or stealing and etc... Will automatically be put down as there is no longer a reason to do those things as they would receive housing, free school up to an associates degree, free  groceries up to a certain extent and free internet, absolutely no reason for criminal activity. Those who don't agree with me, while ya the fathers and men get the shit end of the stick, look their new generation is the one awarded and the U.S. environment could use more trees and less trash. As it is, population is too high, so I believe many criminals need to be put down. Me being an animal lover, even I understand that some violent dogs need to be put down. I feel the same needs to be done with man kind. Anyone harboring criminals including drug lords should be imprisoned and will be put down unless interrogation was non-cooperative. In other words no more criminal action!",

So our ppl suffer because of it and the less educated (who are the ones that end up in USA) immigrate. You want cheap shit well then there are consequences like ppl who cant make a living in the country you are vampiring and going to your country illegaly. and so they go to your country just to get treated like shit. You ppl are ignorant instead of attacking the greedy ass companies who you can regulate you attck poor ppl who are fighting for crumbs and are victims of circumstance. So when you say build the wall and mexico you pay for it i say FUCK YOU just take your shitty badly paid companies back. Assholes the whole lot of you... well not the wholelot some of you are ok in my book, the smart ones",

I do not think we should have any sanctuary cities for that is act of treason to say that another country citizen is more important then the citizen of their own country is treasonous So you will not change my mind on border security there has been too many people whom have lived in New Mexico as an illegal and never got their papers at the opportune time Instead they waited 18 years to get their papers and how that was allowed I don't know. Also my brother's grandmother  was upset that someone could have the audacity to think this this was ok and not a shameful act to come to this country and fill entitled to it after all she had to come here legally from Mexico My mother was hit by an illegal allien in a automobile accident with no driver's license no insurance so yes its a growing pandemic.",

Most illegal immigration comes through the air and water (with people overstaying their green cards) so the wall is more a symbolic gesture.\nBut what conservative would support spending atleast $10 billion on symbolism?? This is an extreme misuse of government and more a leftist stance. If you want better border security why not spend the $10 billion on actual better security instead of wasting it on good feelings.\nFacts dont care about your feelings, and the fact is the border wall is just a huge waste of money.",

If you really want to eradicate illegal immigration, start with the countries from where these people are coming from, invest in them, open new jobs, create better live opportunities, and afterwards, you'll see a decrease in illegal immigration. The thing is, people always find ingenious ways to go around artificial boundaries, and I think the best example is the Berlin Wall.\nMy point is, this is a populist policy that doesn't have a predecessor in history (when it comes to it being successful).

Therefore I believe that while immigration control is important the wall would be ineffective. \n\nA good case study is the UK as we have lots of illegal immigrants and as we are an island we essentially have a ‘wall’ formed by the ocean. \n\nMany statistics I’ve seen actually suggest that many immigrants use the border to return home and so a wall may actually prohibit people leaving America thus adding to the immigration problem.",

That is stated in the term \"illegal\" immigrants!!!\n\nThis whole debate is just too hard for us Americans to come together and solve. There are just too many people thinking with their heart and emotions rather than using logic. Yes, generally 99% of people in the world are good hearted people, but even a rapist can be a good hearted person 99% of the time. Spending several years in El Paso, Texas, I saw first hand the problems with illegal immigration and the issues law enforcement/community/border patrol dealt with on a daily basis. I also spent time in Pittsburgh and New York where the situation of illegal  immigrants is not so prevalent as on the southern border. With that said, I see how hard it is for a majority of the country not living close to (land based) borders to be so empathetic to these people and can't possibly comprehend the real issues our country is having with this. \n\nWhether you think with your heart or your head, go visit a local homeless person or veteran and decide if their life is less important than somebody that trespassed (into this country).  If we would have a little more compassion in our heart for the American population struggling now and use a little more logic in dealing with the people that side stepped the law, we could solve both problems. Just food for thought..... where would $5 go further? Mexico or USA? Wouldn't the solution be for us figuring out how to provide more foreign aid to foreign, poverty stricken areas rather than looking the other way when a poor illegal migrant sneaks into a higher cost of living area????",

Building it will be seriously worthless and after a few years people will find a way of getting over it or thru it. Please remember that Mexico is our neighbor and stopping them from coming in illegally is impossible, best thing to do is make it harder for them to come in, by securing borders better, and adding more security and actual human reinforcement, NOT A WALL. The government should imply to everyone how important a Border Patrol job is, and make it easier, cheaper and more accessible for the young generation to become a Border Patrol Officer. Because security is what is needed, not a stupid wall.\n\nYes I do feel like what I wrote is good and I stand by it, but I still keep in mind that this country was created by immigrants, and Americans are not the founders of this land. AND, almost half of the U.S. was once Mexican land! The U.S. needs to stop seeing Mexicans/illegals as negatives just because of a small percentage of them commit crimes. If that is the case, all crackheads and druggies should also be deported or incarcerated for life because they also damage our country. Reinforcement is the key.",

If u pretend to put Russia where Mexico is right now. The exact same thing would happen. I’m making this point because I feel like trump is targeting just Mexicans even though anyone would come to the US if they were close enough. And I’m sure there are immigrants who come to the US and commit crimes. I could be wrong but I don’t think that people get deported if your from let’s just say Sweden and commit a crime",

If Mexico Will really pay it, than build it so the idiotic corrupt government of Mexico feels shame. If that wall will make the Mexican and central American countries wake up the to really change the ways of it's corrupt culture/government. But I don't think that's going to happen. I think we should hire more law Enforcement officers that also aren't corrupt. I leave near the border in the u.s side and know many criminals that I don't necessarily agree with but grew up together in schools, neighbor hoods, etc. And know for a fact that alot of border patrol are corrupt, they bring the drugs in and also know a person who received weapons from   a border patrol on the Mexican side. They cross it through the mountains because nobody will ever say anything. So I also believe that is something to be fixed in our government. And we here about el chapo,but do they ever catch drug lords from the us? Instead of focusing on building a wall that will not prevent anything from coming if corruption on the American side isn't delt with . Maybe instead of border patrol, have more military. Also, drugs and people cross illegaly through the port of entry as well.  Many time with the authorization of u.s customs. Corruption is the problem there as well. I say invest that money in removing sanctuary City laws, really looking for illegal criminals in all neighbor hoods. We need more law enforcement budget to really help build a better law enforcement around the country and in sanctuary cities, enforcement with abiding laws from the federal government and not the state government. All with respect, no hard feelings just business. Get criminals out, but help hard working  people and students get there legal status and pay taxes so the Clinton's bank doesn't get slimmer Lol...if they do build it, I'll make sure to put a taco stand as the ones building it will be Hispanics hahahahaha. What an irony. Also, remove welfare, i'll guarantee lazy people all over the place  Will do the work that illegal immigrants do that nobody else wants to do to avoid dying of hunger.",

Set up a system of cameras along the border that live stream to paid subscribers of the program. Each camera stream can be viewed by any subscriber at any time, and multiple users can view the same stream. The subscription revenue, say, $1/mo per simultaneous stream (if you have multiple monitors, each looking at a different stream, each costs you $1/mo, so 10 separate streams would be $10/mo total) would likely encourage more people to try it, and generate revenue for covering operation costs and installation.\n\nThe viewers can report illegal crossing through the stream interface. To prevent false flagging reports being sent, the report would be checked to see if other viewers are reporting within the same time. If it appears that it's valid in that many different people are reporting, it'll send a report to the nearest volunteer security team. Minutemen, if you will. The minutemen, who have registered as volunteer civilian border security, will respond to the report on their own dime.\n\nAs an incentive for the minutemen to handle captured immigrants humanely and to properly turn them over to immigration services, the minutemen must video document each capture, and at the end of the year, the top 10% of minutemen groups will be exempt from paying any federal taxes that year, as a thanks for their service.\n\nThere would also be two groups of captures. Captures that are clearly people who don't intend to assimilate into American culture and law (such as drug runners, thugs, or just anyone who doesn't speak English fluently enough to be understood), and those who seem like promising candidates for citizenship (they've learned English, seem otherwise law abiding despite crossing illegally, and appear willing to do honest work). The candidate group can be granted asylum, as long as they have a volunteer sponsor who will not only endorse them for citizenship, but also foot the bill for the paperwork. This will allow charity organizations to form who wish to help people legally become citizens, and said charities must also document the people they help on their own dime. Charities will be reviewed every 3 years, and if their candidates - now turned citizen - are staying out of crime, the charity's staff will be exempt from federal taxes for the next 3 years.\n\nThis system is far more realistic and cost effective than spending trillions on a wall and federal border security staff, and will likely yield a much better outcome for all parties involved, save for the drug runners and thugs. By having nearly the whole operation civilian operated, cost is kept down, and the people maintain power over the border, not the government (a check against tyranny).\n\nWhat do you guys think?\nWhat would you change/add, and why?",

And I mean you might think that they can get a lawyer, but the thing is that they are leaving a country full of poverty. They themselves are probably in a state of poverty, how do you expect them to pay the fines that are asked of for the process to go? I understand both sides of the argument, but I also believe that the U.S government can do much more to help them with the process, and make sure that everyone has an actual opportunity, rather than continuing with the hate, and the comments that have been going on",

To address this concern, Martinez, Lee, and Nielsen (2004) studied drug and homicide crime in Miami, Florida, and San Diego, California, to determine if there is a relationship between violent crime and immigration. Although both cities have a large Hispanic and immigration population, Martinez et al. found that foreign-born persons were not responsible for the communities’ drug and violent crime. The increase in crime was associated with second-generation youth, who were more likely to be involved in homicides related to drug offending in both communities. According to the researchers, “segmented assimilation” among second-generation youth can explain criminal patterns, since Mexican American youth in poor neighborhoods, despite cultural assimilation, committed violent crimes. If, however, immigrant families had economic stability (e.g., jobs), their offspring were not likely to engage in drug-related homicides.\n\nMartinez, Stowell, and Lee (2010) analyzed the relationship between homicide and immigration in San Diego during periods of major increases in the foreign-born population (1980–2000). They wanted to test the “immigrant paradox.” The paradox is that despite social disorganization theory’s prediction that people living in socially disorganized neighborhoods will have higher crime rates, communities with large immigrant populations have lower levels of crime. Martinez et al. posited that immigrants exhibit strong social controls (education and mental health attributes) and rejuvenate neighborhoods that had been previously considered to be high-crime inner-city communities. While the researchers found that socially disorganized neighborhoods experienced increases in homicides, they also found that, when communities had an influx of immigrants, there were fewer homicides. Their findings suggest that while certain neighborhoods foster crime, if recent immigrants settle in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods, the impact on the violent crime rate can be nullified.\n\nSampson, Morenoff, and Raudenbush (2005) analyzed data for Chicago between 1995 and 2002 to determine if ethnic and racial differences in neighborhoods account for residents’ engaging in violence. They found that age, recent immigration status, and ethnicity matters when analyzing crimes of violence. Youth in all race and ethnic groups are more likely to engage in violence, and the level of violence peaks at ages 17 or 18. In addition, they found that recent immigrants engaged in less violence than their offspring; third-generation immigrants had higher levels of violence than second-generation, and second-generation immigrants had higher levels of violence than first-generation immigrants. When considering race and ethnicity, African Americans had higher levels of violence than whites, and whites had higher levels of violence than Mexican Americans, even when controlling for neighborhood composition. Neighborhoods matter: if a neighborhood had a higher level of violence prior to changed social demographics (changes in the immigrant population), then the odds that persons in the neighborhood would engage in violence were significantly higher than in other neighborhoods.",

You wouldn't just be able to pay them cash off the books in exchange for not ratting them out anymore!  They don't WANT to pay taxes, and aside from expensive and highly invasive crackdowns on every small local business, nothing is going to stop them from illicitly inviting and harboring cheap-ass labor off the books.  It's like slavery; too many people see it as an economic necessity.  If you can't convince state government to cooperate with the Feds as it is, how are you going to convince the slavemasters themselves?\n\nNow they can't do the invasive crackdown without total hardline support from all agencies involved, and the months or years of downtime alone in all the agricultural operations during this illegal labor crackdown would create food shortages or at the very least an economic panic for a very long time.

My problem with the wall is its just a political grandstanding move that would cost us taxpayers.. If it were donation based funded I'm fine with that, although I really don't understand the use. Historically walls don't work, so in a time when we have helicopters, planes, boats, submarines, and machines that can dig through our earth underground, I'm less than convinced your going to stop much drug trafficking. The cartels have fuck you money and they will find a way to get the product to the streets. So the only people you would be stopping with a wall are the people in desperation the ones who try and trek across the dessert with their kids to give em better lives and honestly imo if they make it to the US and they are non violent they should definitely get a path to citizenship.",

    "commentText": "The wall is pointless imo. Arguably even detrimental. \n\nConsider that most illegals in the country these days didn't actually run across a border. Many came on boat, a plane, etc, and another large chunk are overstaying visas. That's not to say a wall wouldn't deter illegal influx, but it certainly isn't the primary component, and it's arguably not as useful anyway.\n\nI claim the wall would be ineffective because walls already exist. Mexico has one along its southern end. This hasn't stopped Guatemalan, Honduran, Salvadoran, Colombian, and Venezuelan influx at all. Drugs, illegal firearms, and illegal immigrants still flood past those walls into Mexico, and then the US and Canada. Adding one more wall isn't much of an obstacle when there are many up already. \nIn modern day, the only effective border \"wall\" is the one along North Korea. It's an extremely militarized zone that shoots anything that moves, and has robots and minefields everywhere designed to automatically kill anything that comes near. The US could never set up such a border, we'd be considered inhumane by the rest of the developed world, and have the opportunistic Chinese and Russians and EU ready to \"spread democracy\" onto us for once. \n\nThen, let's consider the cost. \"Mexico will pay for the wall\" has always been a meme, we all know this. This wall is coming out of our pocket, and contributing to the disastrous mess the national budget has become. It might not even provide the benefit people expect. In other words, we're paying for a product that already exists in other countries and has not done much.\n\nFinally, let's consider the implications behind it. The immigrant communities seem to consider the wall to be a symbol of hostility: racism, xenophobia, whatever. Whether they're correct to harbor such sentiment is irrelevant: the fact is that they do. And because they do, the wall would serve to create a further divide internally. Republican support from minority communities saw an increase leading up to Trump's election. Can we afford to divide and alienate these same groups? I'm not sure. \n\nIt's not of debate that illegal immigration is harmful to the country. It absolutely needs to be remedied. But a wall, imo, does very little to target the actual problem.",

It took a lot of time and money to accomplish this on a very small scale.  Then they split the illegals into 3 teams of two men.  They instructed one group to go over it, one group to go through it, and one group to go under it.  They provided the men simple tools.  Each team accomplished their tasking in under two minutes.\n\nThe proposed \"wall\" will need to be more intelligently designed and implemented than simply a physical barrier.   It will need sophisticated drone monitoring from above, rapid response teams of security stationed across it's vast expanse, underground detection systems to sense tunneling, engineering and maintenance teams to repair and constantly adapt it to the efforts of our undesirable, etc.. etc..\n\nWithout these controls and, no doubt, many more I haven't  considered, this wall is just a waste of money which provides only the illusion of security.  With the additional controls I mentioned, this wall may work, but will likely cost many billions of dollars in materials and human resources, to build, operate, and maintain.  It would also require new laws in place to treat those thwarted in their attempts to bypass it, as terrorists, or violators won't fear the wall.\n\nThis \"wall\" would also require making many small groups of special police, with the full backing of the US and Mexican governments, who are authorized to treat the dangerous illegals as terrorists, and prosecute them very harshly.  These special police would also feed information gathered through criminal arrest and interrogation, which will allow special forces groups to target  sources for this activity and eliminate them by any means necessary.  Hopefully with the collaborative efforts of the central and South American countries.\n\nThis \"wall\" will require all of this and more to truly stop this problem of these criminals thumbing their noses at our border and legal system.\n\nBut the cost is high, and will likely, if successful, only bring rise to a new breed of domestic criminal to supply the drugs and fill the power vacuum left by the former regime.",

Perhaps it's the media outlets today polluting and infecting the minds of the masses resulting in a lack of intellect. There's no point in inviting him back to share his grand idea of x ray scanning borders with \"digital pass codes\". Some people are not capable of seeing the bigger picture or adjusting their stance on a topic like this. People who think like this are operating off of someone else's logic and opinions and are simply following the leftie trend of anti-trump everything, rather than actually piecing a puzzle together (which is to build the wall) and finding common ground. They resist logic to save their ego and poisonous mindset.  This guy thinks he can solve it with his own \"creativity\". \n\nThere's a concerning number of people just like this guy who's mission is to argue that you are wrong.

I do see things both ways and I agree that some of the people that come here from other countries dont  help the USA but honestly the majority and I would say 95% of them are honest and hard working people that contribute to the US. Aside from that the law is the law and weather we like it or not we have to follow it and we cant change it if anything we are here at mercy. I'm not making excuses for breaking the law but if only Americans and other people saw us as human beings first other then just an iligal alien from another country things would be different and America can benefit from it.

I know quite a few Mexicans (all legal) for my area's demographics, and while in my particular state they don't have to fear much, they absolutely hate illegal immigrants, many of which are extended family who didn't want to go through the process and just wanted the benefits of our broken healthcare system; and since they can't function in society being illegal aliens, they've resorted to crime. It makes my friends incredibly depressed because of what their extended family or friends of the family are choosing to do, and it's hurting them because the illegal's reputation hurts the reputation of legal immigrants.\n\nI for one am not sure building a physical wall will help a ton for how much it'll cost in the long run, but I do support more strict enforcement and perhaps greater security presence on the border. I don't claim to be an expert, but I'm definitely on the side of enforcing legal immigration and doing what is necessary and feasible to prevent illegal aliens from entering.",

    "commentText": "Ah, building The Wall. Making the borders more secure. I guess these would be my argument:\n\nAccording to research by Massey, Durand and Pren from 2016, \"if policymakers had done nothing---never increased the Border Patrol's funding beyond keeping pace with inflation---the undocumented population would likely have grown substantially less. (...) Aside from doing nothing, however, there were other policy options available to officials beyond attempting to suppress migration through police actions at the border. One such option would be to accept Mexican migration as a natural component of ongoing economic integration under the North American Free Trade Agreement.  Between NAFTA's implementation in 1994 and 2010, for example, total trade between Mexico and the United States rose 5.3 times while according to data from the Office of Immigration Statistics (2014) entries by business visitors increased 3.6 times, exchange visitors 6.2 times, tourists 12.1 times, intra-company transferees 17.4 times, and treaty investors more than a thousand times. Within an integrated economy, people inevitably will be moving.\" Other options could include policies \"to encourage return migration, such as lowering the cost and risk of remitting U.S. earnings, paying tax refunds to returned migrants, making legal immigrants eligible for U.S. entitlements even if they return to Mexico, and cooperating with Mexican authorities to create attractive options for savings and investment south of the border. The billions of dollars wasted on counterproductive border enforcement would have been better spent on structural adjustment funds channeled to Mexico to improve its infrastructure for public health, education, transportation, communication, banking, and insurance to build a stronger, more productive, and more prosperous North America and eliminate the motivations for migration currently lying in ineffective markets for insurance, capital, and credit\" (Massey 2009)\n\nAnd yes, there are better measures to ensure the safety of the borders than pumping the money in. One way would be an approach described by Amy Ding (2014):\n1. Estimate the number of illegal border-crossings that occur stochastically during an r time period (see the research for formulae)\n2. Link this with desired patrol effectiveness to determine the number of required patrol teams (see the research for formulae)",

Fact is that no actual old-fashioned barrier will keep people out.  They can easily go around your wall (by boat, plane, bribes, false identities, on and on).  There's plenty of high tech options that could be utilize.  Just check out military surveillance for ways to devise better security over already established borders.  \nAnother idea?  But, this has to do with cooperative efforts on the other side of the border.  Create economic incentives for people to want to stay there.  Hmmm, it's like how tax havens work.  People flock to tax haves, don't they??? People flock to places that bring economic opportunity and better life quality.   Anyhow, there's a few ideas.  There's really multiple issues that would have to be addressed to reduce any incentive or gain for people to want to try to enter a country, illegal or legal.",

Go in any construction site near border and just make then pay taxes, oppsss become legal=);\n\nOfcourse they will cause problems with violence, becouse they dont embrace the culture, they dont become american,  problematic  like the oter troubled communites.

The people here now must meet certain requirements like having been here a number of years, speaking English, no crime record, etc.\n\nOnce we give path to citizenship to those that deserve it, we know that most people become illegal immigrants when they overstay their visa. So when applying for the visa, those people must explicitly put in their destination city and address so that they can get logged in some database for when the 6 months are over, they know where to find that person.\n\nThose that violate the rule will not have visa privileges ever again. Having their full information and other people to contact that know them will simplify the searching process. Once they realize it’s better to leave and then come back, they will enforce the law themselves. \n\nBut how do we handle those crossing the border through land? Not with a wall. You can dig a hole or jump it. Trust me, there will be workarounds and the cost of a wall is just a terrifying number. We’d already taxed way too much as it is, and being taxed even more to support something I don’t agree with is intolerable. \n\nI think the biggest influence for catching people would be to invest in more border patrol safety. Also, it’s important to have some internal analysis on the areas that have more people caught and improve the surveillance around those areas.\n\nI do think something needs to be done but there is a more humane way about doing things. Splitting families apart, sending college students back, and sending people that haven’t been to their native land since they were 2 years old are some examples of why not every illegal immigrant deserves to be sent back.",

If you come here illegally and murder or rape or commit any kind of assault or harm on an American citizen, you are executed without a trial. If you're here illegally, you cannot obtain any support from any social program at all, and doing so means you will be deported to Columbia where you will be turned into a slave to produce drugs. If you're here illegally, you must report every single penny you earn in employ to the IRS, and pay a flat 20% tax on top of normal income and sales taxes. If you're here illegally, you may not own property, and you may not vote, you may not drive, and you are banned from consuming alcohol. That seems like a fair trade for illegal residence. If they're willing to put up with that shit and can make it with those taxes, I honestly don't mind them being here.",

The wall would have a massive negative environmental impact, and many scientists are already concerned about the effects of what the current, limited wall is doing to the wildlife. The proposed idea of expanding the wall has the fish and wildlife service and scientist concerned even more. About 100 plant and animal species which are already considered endangered would be affected by the wall, along with approximately another 800 different species. Many of these species have the area around the US Mexico border considered to be a critical habitat. Dividing up the area could be fatal to the wildlife and would split up even more species.\n2. 27% or more (that was the lowest percentage I could find, some of the others were above 60%) of illegal immigrants come by plane and overstay their visas.\n3. If the wall covered the entire border it would be 2000 miles long, which would cost over 15 billion.\n4. The wall would cut through rough terrain, along with villages, rivers, mountains, and peoples homes.\n5. Maintaining and staffing the wall would cost taxpayers (forever). \nI would bring up more statistics about illegal immigrants, but I already know that the sources that I would use to make these claims are going to be considered \"bias\" when compared to your sources (which I consider bias).\nThe war on drugs is a failure and you could easily say that it has made the situation worse in some ways, so saying \"it makes the drug war really hard\" 12:15 in the context of no border wall is false. The war on drugs has lowered the price of drugs.",

    "commentText": "Steven,\nI just watched you video CMM Build the Wall. For the most part it appears similar opinions and reasons keep coming up in a vicious circle. People for the wall enjoy the greater sense of control and protections the wall hopes to provide. This includes the hot topics of drugs, citizenship, taxes, welfare, assorted taxpayer bennifits, assistance programs, background checks and balances. The people against the wall, for one, don't want it because Trump does, and/or they're against the expense, they don't believe Mexico will pay for it, they claim the impact is not that big of a deal yet are still against illegal immigration, they have conflicting views of the importance of secure boarders, and they claim that the wall will violate the rights of immigrants amongst other things. And thus the circle goes round and round.....\n     And then there's me, I think both sides are wrong and hyper focusing on all the wrong things. And I believe that's the way it was intended....  So Mr Crowder, sit back relax and listen to be babble, and I invite you to change my mind.\n     When I was a kid I'd fall down and scrape my knee. Mom would put a bandaid on my booboo, but my booboo was still there, I just couldn't see it as easily.  I was focused on the bandaid now instead of the actual problem- watching where I was going to avoid falling in the first place.  \n     We don't need our Southern neighbors to cause crime for us, we do just fine with that on our own for goodness sakes. But you don't see us tossing up walls around the Bronx, but somehow the US keeps ticking on. As far as I'm personally concerned LGBTQC (C is for computer hahaha!!!) does more damage that's longer lasting for generations to come. But anyways....  \n     Boil it all down about the wall.  There's lots of issues at hand. But the main ones that have always come up for years and years now, and continue to come up, includes Gov bennifits. All of them. People quickly get their knickers in a twist when it comes to money. Everyone is looking out for themselves. There's the real concern of the impact so many illegals have on the system which is struggling already anyways, and they're worried about getting what's theirs.... People are mostly pro wall because, well Mexico is paying for it afterall. Its a free asset protection in very real terms. And wether Mexico pays or not, they don't care because it'll still be free to them. \n     So what am I getting at??? The Nanny State. Not many people burn $100 bills. And its the same with the Nanny State, people are not willing to abandon it. Why throw away an asset?  Its typically not done! Yet it is my argument that is exactly what Americans should be focusing on and talking about. Abandoning all Socialist programs no matter what the cost $. YES! I live what I preach! I'm unemployed right now! I did NOT file for unemployment when I got laid off because I am not a Socialist! I do not believe in taking from others. \n     But before I loose you, honestly if there were no Gov bennifits of any kind except for the protection of Freedom, what would be the dead honest problem of a nice family driving from Mexico to San Diego for the day with not so much more then a boarder check and perhaps a drug sniffing dog before they continued on their way? While the spend money here they pay sales tax for goodness sakes (the ONLY Lawful tax by the way). Sure there's more to it, there always is. But take the nipple out of the USofA peoples mouths, and please explain the issue of any and all Mexicans immigrating to a better place? I'm NOT against the wall either, not against the current boarder we currently have. I'm simply against the greed and entitlement that these gov bennys have created! Our founding fathers would be ashamed of us and sorely disappointed that we have allowed these issues to get above us! Again!!!  And theres NO garuntee with or without a wall that a Mexican family will be any less Lawfull or drug free then my neighbors next door. Does Mexico have drug cartels and problems? Yes. So do we. Humans suck!  Instead of medaling in the middle east perhaps we could have been assisting with that same force within our own Country and our Neighbors to diminish the problems. Perhaps our prisons could be modeled after other Countries invested in rehabilitation of inmates. Perhaps with a greater show of force and enforcement and consequence people would be less likely to do drugs. Perhaps if America didn't hate God then there could be greater moral courage. And perhaps without all these gov bennys and grants maybe wouldn't be so dang entitled and lazy and depressed in the first place.\n      Sure, fine, go build a wall. But I garuntee that it will not fix the problem. It'll most likely make it much worse. \n     I'm not crazy. I'm not closed minded. I look at things differently. I look for the Constitutional element. Never once was the plan to flee here, to tax people to death and give them free stuff taken from others, and then get mad at anyone else who equally was desiring to flee their corrupt gov for a better life to the land of the free. A wall?  Really? Is this really what we have become? \n     So again my friend, I'm am neither for or against the wall, but I'm against the reasons for both. The only wall that we need, is one around DC, with unlocked crash bar doors opening into it and with inward facing barbed wire around the top. \n     America is dying.... this wall won't fix the problems. \nSincerely,  Herb Mason",

    "commentText": "I love your videos and I agree with your points 90% the time. This however, hits pretty close to home. I’m a 19 year old Latino from Mexico. I don’t particularly care for the wall, as I do understand that illegal immigration is not okay. However, this “illegal immigration” has happened many times throughout history. Biggest example: European Settlers fleeing religious persecution embarked ships and set sail to find a new land to be able to exercise these new beliefs. Another example would be Swedish migration towards Western United States in the 19th century due to the massive rise in population. This concept isn’t new and everybody has a different perspective. There are times where it is okay to use a lawful compass, and there are other cases where many prefer using a moral one. I have had a work permit for about 4 years now and this work permit allowed me to study to get a drivers license and drive legally. This work permit allowed me to come out of the shadows and get a social security number. This work permit allowed me to work legally and allows me to file my taxes. When people like the Trump Administration mislead and spread pseudo knowledge, other people who know no better end up following his morale and decide to agree with them. This creates separation within the nation and screws people over who pay $1500 to renew this permit per 2 year gaps. I’m not saying don’t build the wall, I’m simply giving those people who bash on every immigrant and idea of what is going on. I pay a lot of money to keep this permit and to actually be placed on the radar. So when people say build a wall, they also start to screw people like me who want to succeed over. Thank you for reading this.",

Building this wall isn't gonna stop every immigrant from finding a way around this thing. Instead, what we SHOULD be doing is helping to solve the issues that CAUSE Southern Americans to want to flee over here to our country. When those issues are solved, BOOM, it's a win-win situation for both sides. South America is freed of their issues, and we don't have to deal with so many illegals causing issues for us.",

There  is an entire cave structure of tunnels that the wall couldn't take care of. For it to take care of all of these holes there would be a humongous price, much higher than the already estimated price Trump is naming, and this money would be coming out of our own pocket because there's no reason that Mexico could pay for it, even if they could. Furthermore, there is a considerable lack of border patrol, which would be a much better way to approach the goal of preventing illegal immigration, when we don't consider that the biggest cause of illegal immigration is really people coming on temporary visas and then not leaving. A wall will not prevent these people from coming into our country, where better guarding of our borders by actual people would be more affordable. Further, increasing the guards at the border provides more long-standing jobs than the ineffectual wall would.  And from what I hear, the wall would be more effectual in keeping people in rather than out, seeing as more people are trying to leave than enter this country. We also have people who live in the United States legally that have property this wall would run through, which doesn't benefit these people at all.",

Not only that a wall that size will take years to build. Chances are one of the future presidents will abandon that wall. We wasted money and time to build that wall. Trump claims Mexico will build the wall, there's many things Mexico could do to stall the building of the wall and wait it out until their free of building it. Also convincing Mexico to build the wall is highly unlikely. Now let's say the wall is complete, there's many other ways to get into the country. Building the wall will only cause conflict with Mexico, and right now we can't afford to be on bad terms with any other countries. (Keep in mind I'm not against the wall, I'm just thinking of the reality of it)",

A year earlier the number was 427,400.\" What regulations, policies and marches are happening for these children. And what is the defining factor of children that are considered being treated poorly? Half a million kids in care almost (just in foster care, i don't believe thats counting group homes as well), what are we doing as a people and as a community to not only prevent these numbers from increasing, and what are we doing to help the children themselves? Is it safe to assume that there currently isn't enough resources to support children in Canada and America if these numbers are growing at high rates? Wouldn't having state and provincial child welfare laws, mean geographical location defines that childs resources? And when do people start rallying behind Indigenous issues currently in Canada and America? Love what you do Steven! Thank you for being the voice we need!",

My sister is marrying an English man, they both live in Barcelona, Spain.\nThey have been working for around 1-2 years to get her fiancé to the US legally. Spent time and a lot of money they don't have to make this work. It's very difficult. \n\nThe fact that people think 'it's racism, it's only Mexican citizens' is NOT true in any sense, becoming a legal citizen of the US is hard, for ANY immigrant,  be you a white man from England, a fisherman from Japan, or anything in between.\nIn my humble opinion. The laws should maybe be fixed up to make it easier for people to come legally. The process is hard,  and desperate families will do anything to give their children better lives. Legally or not.\nSo maybe change the way we handle immigration, so it's not SO difficult to come legally.\nIf i'm wrong please let me know.",

I know that’s a point that’s been made before, but if you want to secure the border for the foreseeable future, I’m not sure just a wall will fix it. Walls, yes worked in the past for hundreds and thousands of years. But we exist in an age where transport is getting cheaper, and easier. We have small, inexpensive, efficient planes and boats, openly available to anyone, and there’s hundreds of Caribbean islands to smuggle drugs through. That aspect of easy transport is only going to make the wall less and less useful as the years go by. In 10-20 years the wall may be... completely and utterly useless. People like to use the wall of Israel as an example for the “walls work” argument... Israel isn’t America. We have 350million citizens and thousands upon thousands of miles of border to secure. So saying “it worked there it’ll work here” isn’t really valid. I’m not saying the wall WONT help stop illegal immigration, because it would, but you have to think. Is the amount its going to help  going to... be enough in the long run to payoff it’s massive, massive budget needed.",

Stats came out February 21, 2018\n\nThese are statistic from the NON-CITIZENS FEDERAL CRIMES \n\nNON-CITIZENS FEDERAL CRIMES STATS:\n\n22% of all Murders \n18% of all Fraud\n33% of money laundering\n29% of drug trafficking\n72% of drug possession\nAreas where non-citizens account for a much larger share of convictions than their 8.4 percent share of the adult population include:\n· 42.4 percent of kidnapping convictions; \n· 31.5 percent of drug convictions; \n· 22.9 percent of money laundering convictions; \n· 13.4 percent of administration of justice offenses (e.g. witness tampering, obstruction, and contempt); \n· 17.8 percent of economic crimes (e.g. larceny, embezzlement, and fraud); \n· 13 percent of other convictions (e.g. bribery, civil rights, environmental, and prison offenses); and \n· 12.8 percent of auto thefts.\n\n\n62% of illegal Aliens house hold have someone on welfare.\n\nSO NOW WE KNOW THE TRUTH.  Not like we didn't know this already.  BUT now we have it in writing from the TOP SOURCE IN CRIME.\n\nThey also do the following that hurts the U.S. Illegals have killed hundreds of innocent Americans when they drunk drive. \n\nIllegals have murdered, raped, robbed, and beaten tens of thousands of innocent Americans. \n\nBring in various diseases since Mexico's health care is horrible for the average \n\nCitizens Driving down wages for American who have been working for years to increase their wages. \n\nUsing schools they didn't pay into the system for i.e., taxes \nHindering American kids education since most don't speak English. \nUsing all the various public services, again, didn't pay taxes to support \nThe hundreds of thousands of crimes ILLEGALS have committed. \nThe cost of supporting them in prison when caught committing crimes. \nThe unwillingness of taking responsibility for their actions, i.e., breaking our laws then trying to give some sort of EXCUSE to justify it. IT\"S WRONG. \nIt hurts American much more than helps. \nThe only people failing the Mexican people are failing Mexican people. \nHow about fixing your own country and stop hurting MINE. \n\nHere is an OPTION TO FIX MEXICO \nThe Mexican people need to apply to the U.N. for help. \nThey can dispense NATO forces to join with the Mexican Military to WIPE OUT the MEXICAN Cartels. Until Mexico does that, they will not have control of their country. \n\nMexico is a beautiful country that is run corruptly. Mexico has the resources, i.e., minerals, land for agricultural, hard working people. Beautiful, warm Beaches, tourism, etc. \n\nTherefore, all the ingredients are there for a very successful 1st world nation. Now they just need the will to enforce law and order from the top down. Again, until they get that will, Mexico will remain a 3rd World corrupt country. Those are the cold hard facts. \n\nNOW GET THE WILL AND TAKE BACK YOUR COUNTRY.\n\n\n\nObviously, this is addressed mainly at Mexico and their pathetic treatment of their OWN PEOPLE, but it applies to most of the South American States.  It's amazing to me how these Latin's call us RACIST for wanting our laws enforced.  YET, they treat their OWN PEOPLE like trash.  What a bunch of HYPOCRITES!  Shameful.

We have to keep the near civil war conditions in Mexico, in Mexico.

I'm still of the Milton Friedman mindset, that illegal immigrants help our economy. I live in a border town filled with food trucks and stands operated by illegals who are otherwise entrepreneurs. They offer great food at lower costs, which helps inflation. On the \"effectiveness\" of a wall, smugglers and drug cartels will be very effective in causing breaches in these walls, and will continue their well-documented bribery of border patrol officers in return for safe passage of the people they smuggle. The drug cartels are notorious for already having infiltrated our municipal governments. We've had many cases of border patrol officers and city police departments here in South Texas that were bribed, or even blackmailed, into letting smugglers through the border. It won't end with Trump's wall. How do we know this? A wall HAS been tried. Bush built a wall during his tenure as POTUS, and that was a major failure. All it did was facilitate a land grab from local farmers in the area.",

And maybe the mark has a certain lifetime aswell so that the person would never be not able to live in the us peacefully. Again this is an undeveloped idea but I just want to put it out there",

Now im not saying everyone who illegally enters America has good intent obviously there are bad apples in the group. But Theres a reason why people come to the US illegally and risk being jailed and deported. . Its because those countries have one of the highest crime rates in the world. In 2016 Latin America had 41 cities in the top 50 of the “most dangerous cities in the world”. \n\nAccording to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Honduras, home to about 8.25 million people, has by far the highest homicide rate of all countries in the world. Its unparalleled average rate of 90.4 murders per 100,000 people means that in this country, almost every 1,000th person is killed. Thats insane.\n\nWith the corrupt government/ police force to the drug cartels of Mexico, to the worlds most dangerous gang, MS-13, to extreme poverty,  its obvious Latin America needs help. Put it this way to those against illegal immigrants and to just give a different perspective to yall. Just maybe if their home wasn’t so horrible to live in, people wouldn’t need to escape and seek a better life in the US. Maybe that would really bring the illegal immigration rate down from latin America.",

Any jail worthy offenses will lead to deportation, but if they keep their nose clean and take English classes, then they're given a citizenship test and will be granted citizenship in the end. \n\nFailure to comply is met with deportation if caught.

    "commentText": "Throughout human history there's always been war. Every war is fought over wealth, resources, and power. Although we still have traditional warfare, war has evolved. Immigration is now being used as a weapon of that war, in both the US and in Europe. People like Soros have weaponized immigration to take away the freedoms of the west. It's unfortunate to say, but there's a reason most people come here illegally. They have little to no education, and little to no job skills, they can't prosper in their home countries, and so they come to America hoping things will be different. They're not. When you have no ability to prosper you're more likely to vote for politicians who will give you government subsidies. We all know which party that is. It's the same party that wants higher taxes, restrictions on freedom of speech, and to abolish the Second Amendment. \n\nIn 1986 Reagan signed an amnesty bill that turned Ca from a red state into a blue state. It's been that way since. Ca has the entertainment, agricultural, tech, and shipping industries. Ca also has the highest taxes, lowest quality of living, the most laws/restrictions, and is $1.3 trillion in debt. People are fleeing because it looks like there's no possibility of changing things. That's what the oligarchs want for the entire country. They want to turn the United States from a 2 party system into a 1 party system... essentially a dictatorship. Once they do that they will have total power. They'll start changing laws, restricting freedoms, imposing higher taxes, and there will be no way to fight what they're doing. America and Americans are what keeps the world balanced. We fight for those who are oppressed. If we become the oppressed then the oligarchs will be free to go after the rest of the world.\n\nAnd while I feel for people who are coming here to try to make a better life for themselves, I think there are better ways of doing things. We won't be able to help anyone if we destroy the United States trying.",

This is not to say make it so immigrating to the United States is unfavourable. What I mean is crack down hard on any incentive illegal immigrants could live here without going through the process legally. From my understanding, many illegal immigrants stay in the country because they are able to still make a living, and/or live off the government which leads to little reason to go through the long process of becoming a legal citizen and paying taxes. If we were to crack down on their source of cash in the United States, then they would have no reason to stay in the country illegally. Now, to help push such a policy through, knowing that the left would despise such a policy, we would take a percentage of the money that were to be allocated to the wall, and put it into streamlining the process to legally enter the United States. Of course this would not mean skimping out on the regular process, but hiring more people and/or restructuring some areas could help the process move faster, thus allowing more legal immigrants into the country. Doing this would decrease the amount of illegal immigrants, could potentially convience the left of immigration reform, and would bring more tax dollars into the States while spending less of the tax dollars on illegal immigrants living off the country.\nI may be wrong in some/all areas, my knowledge on all these situations and statistics are limited, but to me this seems like a more logical approach to the illegal immigration problem. What's at least a bit interesting about this proposed policy of mine is that I wrote about this as the moral approach to immigration in my philosophy class, at a very liberal college, and I ended up getting an A. That surprised me.",

Now the wall yes would prevent illegals from coming but that's only on foot or by car there's still boats and planes. Let's just think out of our whole country 37% of crimes are by illegals.. Out of those illegals its mainly the cartels and gang related community. Those gangs have a shyt ton of money so they can buy thier way in... Or just fly or a boat they got the money. The wall would only stop those fleeing from their country to find safety. Put urself in their shoes. This wall won't bring down that 37% percent because that is controlled by powerful gangs who can easily find another way in. We would only build a wall to waste money and stop those who actually need help and safety from coming in. I mean even if the wall could bring that percentage down by a lot who is going to pay for it? !!!!NOBODY!!!!",

I heard they let in ten migrants and two or four of them got arrested. Thats 20-40%\nUntil all crime rates throughout countries are near zero we need borders. And thats just one reason. We need to be able to keep track of everyone. If youre undocumented, if someone murders you, we have no way to identify your body and get you justice. Its not just for the host country’s sake.

I mean trump even defeated it in his own speech hahaha. \"Idk maybe a rope.\" lmao.\nMexicans aren't stupid, they come up with clever ideas to get around the wall. Heard of the weed catapult? Plane drops, tunnels, mules, etc. The wall is stupid and pointless. Or at the very least stupid to build such an expensive and massive wall to the level that trump wanted. It would be cheaper to save the billions of dollars and hire massive amounts of people that patrol/scope out the border looking for crossers.\n1 billion dollars can pay for 16,666 people at 60 grand for 1 year to drive around the 1,954 miles of the border. The wall is gonna cost what like 70 billion? that's 70 years of patrolling. Or even better just set aside 10 years worth for patrolmen, and develop AI cameras that can detect movement within 1-2 miles and alert patrols to head that way. Drones even too to keep an eye on them. That way you can have better, more efficient surveillance 24/7 that doesn't get tired, and can't be bribed to look the other way.\n\nThe wall is stupid. Use your brain to think of better solutions. A wall will. not. solve. anything.\n\nShould there be at least a sturdy but cheaper to install fence with barbwire or something like that? Sure why not, at least not let them walk right in unsecured. Plus you can put motion sensors or something to detect people climbing over it, and alert patrols to their position. With cameras to verify false alarms or diversion tactics.",

This is an 11 minute autobiography of his success with YouTube:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/S1tFT4smd6E\n\nThis is what I posted in the comment section!\n\n\"Ve I enjoyed your mini autobiography and I liked your story. Perhaps you can help with something? \n\nNot sure how empathetic you are, but I want you to imagine your story with 2 changes,\n\nChange 1: Substitute \"physics\" with guns, gear, and ammo.\n\nChange 2: YouTube turned against you demonetized most of your videos and basically turned you from a successful YouTuber into an e-beggar.\n\nWill you help your fellow YouTubers? I honestly feel that since anyone with (I think it's 50,000) a certain number of subscribers are now considered a partner, you guys should unionize! Imagine if all the partners either joined the Screen Actors Guild or started your own union how much better it would be for the viewer with less censorship. Instead of YouTube being a monopolistic autocracy over video content, the terms of service agreement could be negotiated through collective bargaining!\n\nFrom what I've seen, YouTubers are supposed to be like a big family. I think it's time that instead of ignoring the injustices happening to some of you guy's brothers and sisters, instead you could support them!\n\nHow long do you think it would take for YouTube to come to the table if all of the partners went on strike?\"",

And an \"X-Ray Border\"(I realize it would be x-rays or any kind, ie gamma/beta/etc) but something that scans the whole border all the time for people would be extremely expensive(definitely more than a wall) and you then also need to get other nations like Mexico who don't have the same kind of capital or authority over their citizens to make them take in whatever it is that these border scanners would scan.",

    "commentText": "For those who wonder how Trump could make Mexico pay for the wall: (read if you wanna learn)\n\n On day 1 promulgate a \"proposed rule\" (regulation) amending 31\nCFR 130.121 to redefine applicable financial institutions to include\nmoney transfer companies like Western Union, and redefine \"account\" to include wire transfers. Also include in the proposed rule a requirement that no alien may wire money outside of the United States unless the alien\nfirst provides a document establishing his lawful presence in the United States.\n On day 2 Mexico will immediately protest. They receive approximately $24 billion a year in remittances from Mexican nationals working in the United States. The majority of that amount comes from illegal aliens. It serves as de facto welfare for poor families in Mexico. There is no significant social safety net provided by the state in Mexico.\n On day 3 tell Mexico that if the Mexican government will contribute the funds needed to the United States to pay for the wall, the Trump Administration will not promulgate the final rule, and the regulation will not go into effect.\n Trade tariffs, or enforcement of existing trade rules: There is no doubt that Mexico is engaging in unfair subsidy behavior that has eliminated thousands of U.S. jobs, and which we are obligated to respond to; the impact of any tariffs on the price imports will be more than offset by the economic and income gains of increased production in the United States, in addition to reven ue from any tariffs themselves. Mexico needs access to our markets much more than the reverse, so we have all the leverage and will win the negotiation. By definition, if you have a large trade deficit with a nation, it means they are selling far more to you than the reverse - thus they, not you, stand to lose from enforcing trade rules through tariffs (as has been done to save many U.S. industries in the past).\n Cancelling visas: Immigration is a privilege, not a right. Mexico is totally dependent on the United States as a release valve for its own poverty - our approvals of hundreds of thousands of visas to their nationals every year is one of our greatest leverage points. We also have leverage through business and tourist visas for important people in the Mexican economy. Keep in mind, the United States has already taken in 4X more migrants than any other country on planet earth, producing lower wages and higher unemployment for our own citizens and recent migrants.\n Visa fees: Even a small increase in visa fees would pay for the wall. This includes fees on border crossing cards, of which more than 1 million are issued a year. The border-crossing card is also one of the greatest sources of illegal immigration into the United States, via overstays. Mexico is also the single largest recipient of U.S. green cards, which confer a path to U.S. citizenship. Again, we have the leverage so Mexico will back down. Conclusion: Mexico has taken advantage of us in another way as well: gangs, drug traffickers and cartels have freely exploited our open borders and committed vast numbers of crimes inside the United States. The United States has borne the extraordinary daily cost of this criminal activity, including the cost of trials and incarcerations. Not to mention the even greater human cost. We have the moral high ground here, and all the leverage. It is time we use it in order to Make America Great Again.\n\n\nMe: Remember the point of the wall isnt only to try and stop illegal immigration, drugs, etc. but to slow it down and have a lot less of it. People may be able to find a way in, but it will be VERY HARD.",

For anyone that uses the argument that we will just charge Mexico for it, when there is a new tax on something most of the time the tax gets put on the consumer. Trump can say that we will put tarrifs or charge them for the wall but it will be mostly be paid for my taxes of American citizens.",

You think people who know her wont put 2 and 2 together. Even I could identify her with that. From her voice to her weight. Down to her hair color and style. Down to the bag she carries and glasses she wears. If she lived in a community I was in even with that blurred face I could tell who she was. She told you about people in her complex and you still used her real voice even when she tried to mask what she was saying in order to not get hurt. Yet you still subliminally text out the things she was saying to you. \n\nYou're an asshole. Plus spending billions of dollars on a wall is idiotic. When it was already proven that they use tunnels, cargo containers, and use boats to travel to mountain areas or certain areas in the U.S. to get in. Use that money that was promised they would pay for. Yet apparently we cant use it to help out Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Flint Michigan, New Orleans, etc. You know like actual U.S. areas. It's like the priorities are all messed up. Next we'll build walls separating people by how much they make and what class they are in. I'm not talking about Gated Communities but actual Counties and Districts. Thus preventing people who want to achieve more and get that dream job. They wont be able to because of their class bracket. It'll be no different then Ben Affleck SyFy show the Incorporated or the T.V. series the Colony. Being it's already started with the class system we have now where urban schools receive way worse books and facilities. Yet manage to get drug stores, liquor stores, and gas stations with cartons of cigarettes and alcohol with processed foods pumped into ever other block. Where job opportunities are scarce and if a job reaches a quota on the amount of minorities they receive. Those even with degrees are left back to struggle within their own communities they worked hard to try to get out of. Now once you add a wall this wont effect just minorities. This would infect all urban, and middle class societies. Next certain hospital facilities will be restricted to a certain class of people and those without a higher tax bracket from a certain district wont receive the same medical treatment. This happens already now. Yet watch it get worse. This wall is a bad idea because it sends out the wrong message. That we can disconnect ourselves from people by putting up a wall. This will only lead into a chain reaction that ends up being implemented in our own soil; which will lead to martial law. This is the same reasons why they are pushing so hard for us to get rid of our guns. First its our guns, next its a ton of walls, then its  robots fully taking over our jobs being its happening already, then its martial law and a curfew. Machines like Atlas, AI like Google Duplex and OpenAI will take over the work environment and secretary and office work. Your child will grow up being taken care of by robots like Pepper from SoftBank. Call me a conspiracy theorist. Yet the moment humans who worked the assembly line got laid off for automated machines. You got a robot speaking to you to set up a service or to track a package and no longer a human operator. This is just one step closer with this wall to separate us from rallying together. Being even now people are being manipulated in different areas to think badly of certain areas that aren't even as bad as they seem. Now picture once walls goes up everywhere. \n\nThis wall is a terrible idea which will be one of many on our own soil. Being we already signed and passed a law to kill and bomb U.S. citizens and residents within our country. I don't think people realize how bad of an idea this is.  Funny how all these shows and movies predict the same exact thing. To which most of it is coming to fruition now. It's even highlighted in Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams (2017 ) 'Kill All Others' episode. Being that is not that far from what's happening now.",

Second the wall Trump likes looks like the Berlin Wall with the fat round top so it's hard to get over. I don't want no Berlin wall. Honestly that dude wasn't very informed on the bored situation but one thing he was right on was eventually hopefully there will be no more borders, it's far from my lifetime but I do believe that. Being raised in a Mixed family, my sister is half black.. My mom was a Single white mother, both our fathers committed violent crimes and did time.. Fatherless household, lived on the system until my mother educated herself, graduated from college an got her degree. Lived in cars, trailers, houses. My life has had it's hard moments. I've always been told to vote for Democrats I always did, not really educating myself. The older I got the one thing I hold as my standard in life is \"Be Accountable for Youself\" being on the system as a child you understand that you work hard, invest right, diversify ur finances but whatever you do don't blame other people for your lack of effort. Pretty much I'm saying I agree w a lot of conservative views and values but the wall jus isn't one. Honest I'm okay with ice removing anyone who is here illegally that's committed a felony and changing standards for immigration enforcement. I jus don't think the wall is the right answer. I don't wanna pay for it, it looks like The Berlin Wall and let's face it the money to maintain it keep it running would be staggering high and people are jus gonna find a way around it maybe even through it..

The spike in opiod deaths via overdose didn't start until after DACA was enacted (with the last few years having ever increasing numbers of deaths). The poppy fields in Mexico have tripled in size since 2015, the amount of Fentanyl and Carfentanil being seized in the US has exploded in the last threee years. But, it's the pharmaceutical companies maaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnn. \n\nCarfentanil is a strictly controlled substance, the amount manufacturered for scientific use in the United States is 19 grams. There have been pounds of this stuff seized in drug busts in the last few months. It is being made in China and Mexico and either shipped under surreptitious means (mailed to Canada via China and labelled as printer parts) or trafficked via bipeds via Mexico. The cartels aren't stupid, they're going to use whatever means necessary to get their customers hooked on as strong a stuff as possible to keep them buying. If they die, oh well. The cartels pose a much greater risk to the US than radical Islam IMO.",

But the more important matter is the symbolic meaning of the wall. Building a wall along our southern border creates a certain tension that discourages people from entering the States LEGALLY. It psychologically enforces an idea that Mexican immigrants are not welcome in America. This could, and possibly would create even further tension between us and Mexico. It’s just not a decision I can bring myself to support. Now I do agree with the concept of immigration reform for the protection of American citizens, but not in the form it seems that it will take. When we discuss immigration reform, we are more often than not speaking of either our southern border, or immigrants from West Asia. I don’t want to create a reform that is harsher on certain groups of people than they are on others. This is because all people are equally capable of evil and isolating certain groups not only weakens the security of our country, but also creates tension between us and the groups we are isolating. This might be the longest comment I’ve ever posted on YouTube lol.",

Its befoming a tribal war fare of 3rd world people into our tribes that refuse but pretend to assimilate and will never assimilate and proves why segregation of all people from each other is the only way in the end this world will ever survivem they only come here and survive because the ignorant welfare state. And im tired of hearing how hard workint foreigners are. If that were true then their country of origin would be more advanced then white countries becsuse they would have worked harder to build a better society. Our countries prive we are the hardest working people if we were less hard workint then others we would be the 3rd world and they would be the 1st world im tired of this narrative being pushed just csuse they clean and work in fields and landscaping we have our peoppe and technology to replace them. They would of only been hslf way able to ssy thst if it was 1560 snd even then our people need work and work harder snr smarter the proofs in the production of our past before all immigration our lands had the highest produftion of the entire world that settles any argument.

As in the middle eadt chija and mexico the poppy fields groe wilf in their much warmer lands. Without immigration and import of foreign goods in the west the drug epidemic would be almost non existant besides alcohol. Weed. Shrooms.

The best solution is to take away the incentives that make immigrants believe the illegal way is the best way and enforce strict punishment for those who violate immigration laws. Good luck with that though. Nobody that I know says people shouldn't be able to migrate here. They all just want them to do it legally. Let's be real, it's not like they haven't had ample opportunity to achieve legal citizenship. They either decided to use up their resources to do so elsewhere or were denied. Denials are usually for very good reasons. Some denials are in error but for the most part, they are very ligit. Maybe we should just build all of our prisons along our borders. Then we'd only have to guard one side of the prison and it'd be killing two birds with one stone.",

A wall would not be the best way to handle illegal immigration. Improve the border patrol and focus on fixing infrastructure. The idea of a 1900 mile wall is pretty stupid to begin with, especially since the government owns very little of the border to begin with.",

    "commentText": "I don't know if that guy really has thought the consequences through all the way. It sounds like such a system would be open borders, but a worldwide surveillance state. So basically, both the US and Mexico, and likely other countries would need to develop some infrastructure and either implant chips into citizens at moment of birth (or some other technology such as bar codes, really good facial recognition, or even xray skeletal fingerprinting, etc.) in order to precisely identify an individual person and their location for the purposes of taxing the individual. And if the taxes are not paid they can be quickly collected and punished as the local government sees fit. These \"xray scanners\" would not just be stationed at the border, they would be positioned throughout the entire country, like cell phone towers. Yeah... mandatory tracking of all citizens of every country in the world (or am I misunderstanding and he just wants to do this to Mexican citizens?) seems a tad more controversial than building a wall. \n\nNot to mention all of the other ramifications this would have on society. The government would not be the only one that could intercept and track these signals, ad agencies, your boss, your blind date, that creepy guy next door, they all would be able to track where you are and what you do every day.    \n\nPersonally I have some libertarian leanings, I'm not totally against the state or the concept of taxes, I just think that any power we give the government should be limited and well thought out. This kind of technology could still happen in a small government capitalist scenario, but at least there the individuals are knowingly taking part and can back out at any time. (basically what cellphones are today) This idea is so crazy Orwellian... It is hard to believe someone would come up with such an distopian plan un-ironically. And he wants to be governor of New Mexico?",

A lot of people come over on planes and simply overstay their Visas. Not to mention, if you build a wall it will just make people find a way over or under that wall. A lot of people already come in through our check points by getting smuggled in. It's kind of the luck of the draw when they do it that way - but I don't believe that the majority of illegals are walking across the border. For those reasons I think the wall would be a huge waste of money. If a Democrat gets into office after Trump they will just stop construction on the wall or have it torn down, so it will be a HUGE waste of money that could be used in a lot of other ways to benefit this country (education, infrastructure, etc.)",

Mexico needs to legalize drugs; the problem here is that the US goverment wants to keep silent on the drug use on military forces due to PTSD and other mental disorders, many legal drugs sold in US are very ineffective, the best way to keep it low is the consume of mariguana. So...if Mexico legalize mariguana it means that prize will lower in Mexico so drug cartels wont have big money and will be out of business, for the US is also means the lowering prize in mariguana making it more accesible but it will later add heavy taxes like cigarettes, this will also make the US report huge amount of purchases in mariguana each year entering into the US military budget, if US people find out the country buys excessive amounts of drugs and making Mexico richer, the US wont be able to fund any wars in the future, which in consequence means less firearms production, therefore less production in primary resources for their making, etc.\n3. Mexico needs to lower taxes and have more flow on money for its citizens, the country has a serious fiscal problem practices and mexicans are not willing to pay them because its a heavy tax that can barely cover their basic necessities, they cross to the US to get better money and better opportunities for a living.\n\nSo...if US doesnt address the necessity they need for mariguana and Mexico continues the way it is without changing their policies, it is understandable that a wall has to be built to keep out drugs and unwanted people. The other problem that I have of giving illegals the opportunity to become citizens and pay taxes, is that they also earn the right to vote, if US legalizes every mexican and other southern american people that go there is it changes the demography and geopolitics in the US and power in elections therefore mexicans can have a say so in US politics since they will be like 20% of the US population, so if US wants to protect its sovereignty they should just let born US citizens to vote. And a electronic ID tag or a chip of some sort...no thanks dude I want my right to privacy, a passport and the border politics are good as they are.",

It will be torn down sooner or later if it ever does get built and it was all just a waste. \n\nHighering more border patrol will also not work since already, border patrol agents are being bought by the drug cartels.\n\nIma propose an idea here and yall will probably think I'm stupid. Mexicans immigrating here aren't really a big problem, it's the gullible people coming from the south America's through mexico that are bribed by the cartels to do some stupid shit. So if the United states forces mexico to strengthen their border on the south side, immigration flow will be greatly reduced at our border which will make it easier for us to control our border. If you think mexico is a shit hole, wait till you see el Salvador.",

What Trump is doing right now, which is actually enforcing the current immigration laws, it completely correct. The Coyotes who get people across are smart and would find a way to get people over. Also, it would raise taxes in the states, which would make a lot of people mad and may cause a minor economic crisis.",

I believe that they shouldn't go unpunished but that they shouldn't be deported. These people have built lives and relationships with Americans and have more importantly raised kids who only know of America and are for all intents and purposes American.

Building the wall would be a massive and costly undertaking with not enough valid results, the government is beyond broke we can't afford it. what we need to do is to remove the incentive to come here illegally. If we had strict laws on businesses for using illegal labor, stronger deportation laws, and make it impossible for them to find any work here, it would remove most any drive for them to come to America illegally. Maybe then we could build a superhighway from the border and funnel all the illegal immigrants to Canada and see how well they put up with it :D.",

Hell a lot of people marry for citizenship. Legal workers who are trying just to work in the USA have a lot of procedures to even just be qualified and it takes years because illegals have made it that hard. \n\nNot every illegal is Mexican. A wall wont deter drug dealers from coming in theyve trained to hide in plain sight or like I said just take a “tourist” flight or a “touris” bus ride to get here. We tax payers are just gonna be paying for millions for something ultimately pointless. We need tighter laws about not hiring illegals. Why does no one blame businesses? The ones hiring illegals are the reason why illegals are even coming in. If they get severe repercussions for hiring illegals more businesses will be forced to hire legal citizens  and discourage illegals from coming in the first place.",

There are 2 much larger problems I see that should be focused on first (not saying a wall may be a better answer down the road)\n\n1. Sanctuary cities show that citizens don't care what the government says. If people in America don't want to protect America, it is much more difficult to prevent illegal immigration. \n\n2. Obtaining a work Visa but failing to follow up with becoming a citizen is the major way illegal immigrants enter our country. Changes need to be made to help make it easier to become a citizen (if you saw how difficult it was you would understand what I'm saying) and enforcing deportation to those that let their visas expire will help combat this issue.\n\nBut good luck fixing number 2, with out solving number 1.",

It does not change the reasons  people cross illegally. Short term the solution is, laws that add verification for work and any kind of assistance. \nLong term we have to end the drug war. It puts a multi billion dollar industry, into the hands of criminals. The profits are used to buy officials and further corrupt already ineffective native governments. The drug demand is not going to disappear, America loves drugs.\n In the restricted market left in the wake of the drug war the only possible way to defend profits is with violence. The only way to secure production space, distribution, and market share is violence. That is not just true in Mexico and South America, but right here in the US too\nThe war on drugs has wreaked havoc in poorer areas, of all races. It exacerbates an already high rate of single motherhood, which leads injections of welfare, which leads to more single mothers, which lets to more crime and violence as opportunity is further reduced.\n\nPeople zoom in to much that they do not see the bigger picture of issues.\n\nChange my mind (love the show)",

But the reason people who come from third world countries like Guatemala they don’t have money to get their citizenship. Because there is a fee. And for the people who are already here illegally who want to apply for citizenship risk being deported, taken from their families, and facing jail time in their own countries. They are being robbed rapped and their government is so corrupted to the point where calling the police for help doesn’t help because they’ll rob and rape you too. And they are running from that. That’s why people break the law of coming here illegally. If you’re here as an immigrant just to break the law fuck that and fuck you because you make the rest of them look bad. The people who actually are here to change their lives for the better. To provide for their families to get an education. For those who pay their taxes and follow the law.

No real surprise that all the opposers just wanted to shout profanities and flip the bird. I found it funny that both interviewees actually wanted the 'wall' in one form or another, haha.\n\nI'm really only opposed to the wall for financial reasons. I think it's a pretty significant waste of money. But at the same time, we do have a large problem. Even if we were to offer free citizenship, and perhaps even free healthcare (for a period of time) to entice them to want to become legal, I'm not sure we would see much change. I think the outrage we are seeing from people crying about people being deported is a little misguided. The option was always there to become legal. It's not like the individual was only there a couple of weeks. I'd say it's more than likely been years of them mooching. I wish more people thought more logically about the situation instead of just crying about a wall and deportation. Just like driving your car, if you speed, you will eventually be caught. If you don't change your oil, you'll eventually blow your motor. There will be consequences for not coming over legally, so why not just change your oil asap?",

To be clear, I am not against the idea of stricter illegal immigration control but am against the literal building of a wall.  For starters most illegal immigrants come to America through boats.  Building a literal concrete wall wouldn't stop the majority of illegal immigration.  An actual border wall would be a massive waste of taxpayer money and not even stop the majority of illegal immigration.   A much better idea would be to take a percentage of the millions, even billions of dollars that it would take to build a useless concrete wall of that magnitude and invest that money into more military boats patrolling the seas.  The waterways around the border need to be controlled a lot more than the land borders need to be.  This is a much more effective solution to the illegal immigration problem than building a concrete waste of money.  Trump cited the success of Israel's border wall which was pretty dumb because Israel's border is marginally smaller than ours.  For our purposes, stricter naval control of our waterways and oceans would  cost much less and work much better than a concrete wall.",

It is known that it costs taxpayers 100 of Billions if taxes over a few years or in a single year. Point being we could build the wall one just one or two years would have the wall built. Also ineviatbable it’s not slowing down. Can you imagine the strain on our economy 10 more years? How many walls could be built. At what point is it enough, where do we say enough is enough.

I think background checks and other ID's should be so much more tighter to secure the border. Now I understand, that they will still hop the fence and still get in easy. I honestly think we should do what North Korea does for their border with South Korea. Land mines, and dangerous explosives to give these people that want to illegally immigrate, the idea that ILLEGALLY immigration is wrong, and they either legally immigrate, or don't immigrate at all. Many might disagree. But I also support the wall because of what the Great Wall of China did for them. They built it to stop the Mongolians from coming in and murdering people, setting fire to villages, and raping women. And that worked and the wall is still they today. A wall will help America, but sometimes I think it might be extreme. Some might think that my idea of land mines is awful, and probably will make the situation worse. Opinions are opinions. I respect yours, if you respect mine.",

No wall. To avoid drugs from crossing, lets be real tons of drugs cross everyday some may cross under or over the current call the the biggest problem is that  is a demand. If there is a demand the product will get to the place of demand. They main drug issues is the US needs to prevent drug use. The wall will not fix anything it is just a big expense on the tax payers and can be used on public spending like drug prevention",

Immigration is very, very important... but lets honestly evaluate the feasibility that a wall is going to provide. Short of that wall being manned by armed guards every quarter of a mile, it will never make an appreciable difference. Climb over, tunnel under, blow a hole through it, etc.... the walls we have now have tunnels leading from Tijuana, MX to El Centro, CA... and in order to apply countermeasures to those things, it costs even more money. We're talking thousands of square miles and billions of dollars... This isn't ancient China... we can do better than a fucking wall.",

    "commentText": "DON'T BUILD THE WALL - CHANGE MY MIND\n\nI didn't really learn anything from this video as the arguments on the don't build the wall side were pretty dreadful and poorly thought out, plus it was a relatively short video. So I want to learn more from people who think a wall should be built. \n\nMy thinking is this: (Please correct me if I'm wrong)\n\n1. According to Homeland Security, it will cost around 21.6 billion US dollars to build, not including maintenance (which was backed up by politifact). That's a pretty high opportunity cost, especially when you think of the crumbling infrastructure and the troubled education system in many parts of America that could desperately do with more funding. Despite what Trump says, the Mexican government are not going to pay for it and have officially stated on numerous occasions that they aren't going to. How can you justify the cost?\n\n2. Forgetting the cost and the time it would take to build, it's hard to see how much of an effect it would actually have on illegal immigration and the drug trade. Walls aren't exactly the most perfect way of stopping people from transporting goods or even crossing the border. People have been using tunnels for quite a long time and this would still happen even if there was a wall. As for transporting drugs, people could easily just throw it over or use a drone or something.\n\nEDIT\n\nFirst of all, what's with the hostility of so many of you? I just stated my opinion and said I wanted to learn more about it, and I've already been called a dumbass and told that I should be strung up on the wall. \n\nIt seems that some of you don't understand the difference between a country's government fiscal budget and their current account. Saying that the country will pay for it \"with trade\" doesn't make sense (unless they put massive tariffs on all imports and Mexico don't put any tariffs on US exports, i.e. not going to happen.)\n\nAlso, if there was a wall there, do you not think that they would just find another way to get in? A large proportion of US illegal immigrants come via plane and overstay their visas. Building the wall would just lead to an increase in the number of people doing this.\n\nA lot of you have quoted that illegal immigration costs the us over $100 billion dollars a year. Please say where you got this statistic from, as it's wrong according to almost every source I've checked",

It's ironic to me that the U.S. wants to reach out to various countries to either eliminate terrorists who are killing civilians or just providing general aid with medicine/food, but when it comes to us wanting to allow them in our country to ESCAPE the very hostile situations (that we play a part in trying to resolve) it seems like we suddenly dont want to help them?? I agree that we need to create better programs to allow immigrants to come here legally, to expedite that process. However, many families do not have the time, money, or resources to WAIT months and months to come here legally. A lot of these families are in danger of their lives, and they just want better for themselves and their children. Think about it: if your family and your children are starving and/or in danger of losing their lives, would you wait to come here legally? Or would you flee to seek safety?",

And just like if banks left all the cash on a table behind open doors a lot more people would rob them, But since the cash is in a vault, often times with security, and cameras a lot less people rob the bank, Yes people would dig under the wall, Fly over the wall, Go around the wall, Etc. But the amount of illegals would greatly decrease, And yes you would have people capable of getting past the wall selling that as a service, But if you stop those people or patch their ways around the wall, That will also decrease.",

I'm Iranian and in my country, around 45 years ago, they made a rule forcing women to remove their Hijab. This rule bothered people a lot and women in the majority would find other ways to cover their hair(like hats). This gesture from the king of Iran is what started a chain reaction that led to the Iranian revolution. Once the revolution ended the leader who took over FORCED hijab on the women. Right now in Iran, many women are finding ways to protest to this by finding ways to get away with showing their hair and the majority of women now hate the hijab.\nI agree with you that more strict rules must be placed and more monitoring should be done. However, just like what happened in Iran, if you build a PHYSICAL wall, it can be seen as a bad gesture that will cause more people trying support people in order to get over the border. I believe that a PHYSICAL wall will only make things worse.\nLove your videos. From your Muslim fan. 👳‍♂️😁",

Making this money laundering and not lending is slightly more heinous and naturally supports your argument...but i think its erring on the wrong side of caution this time. Great video otherwise.",

Benjamin Franklin specifically talked about that when he said it wasn't needed because the country would fill up naturally. \n\nHonestly, we need to stop all immigration until we can integrate into a nation of those ideals again.",

Although I am for strict border security and lowering the amount of migrants allowed to enter the country legally from 1M to 500k. I would rather lets say ramp up security by increasing troops at the border with extra fencing that stretches across the entire border. The amount of money that wall production and maintenance would cost would be to much and the government already spends to much.",

Some weird ass law that prevented me from getting passports as a kid without my father there forced me to live in a fucking third world country for 18 years. This is why I'm against illegal immigration. Because as an American citizen I had to immigrate back to my own fucking country legally. If I did it, they can and should fucking do it as well.",

I think the wall would not be too effective and just a wasted taxation on the american wallet.\n\nI hope that makes sense Steven. Also sorry you got asshats yelling driveby insults at you. As always thank you for content.",
