The Democrats do not need the Black American votes. That is why they are fighting so hard to make Illegal immigrants U.S. citizens and having open borders. You is not a country. If you leave your borders open. If you vote for Democrats you might as well remove your locks from your door and leave it wide open to let everyone in and also when you is asleep as well. As time progress let the sancturay city fighters and the Democrat party recruit 20 million undocumented asian children abroad from China and enroll the children in the DACA program including government assistance benefits since China has the largest Population than the U.S. due to the law restrictions of China based on family income of how many children you can have to live in the country of China as an excuse for the undocumented asain children needs to be here in the U.S. If Black Americans really do some real deep research on the Democratic party history. Then you will get the real truth about the Democratic Party. Black Americans will realize they have been supporting the wrong side of the fence for many moons.

Kanye NEVER says the hat gives him superpowers.  NOBODY suggested Kanye is a conservative's hero.  What a pathetic attempt at damage control, but then, it falls right in line with MSM's MO.\n\nFace it libs.  The days of snow-jobbing minorities are coming to an end.  People are seeing what really lies beneath the liberal machine, now that you are on the ropes and showed your cards.",

I rather just know facts, see what happens, and not get opinions.

Kanye loving Trump and meeting him in the Oval Office is terrible for the left because it gives others a chance to see a different viewpoint.

It will turn our nation around by having complete control of the House, Senate and Congress along with a good Back Up of our beloved Constitution by our Divine Supreme Justices.\n \n  So lets vote the male and fem Dem's out. Show um we're sick and Tired and not going to take it anymore! (got that out of Hollywood) üòÅüòáüò∏\n\n  About the Hillderbeast. Her and Slick Willy are Teflon Dons. They slither in and out of the Justice Dept! No male till Pres Trump had the the internal fortitude to Challenge the Deep State (The Swamp). Why? Because most of the SOB's are Dirty to.\n\n  Pres. Trump is a great organizer and a great team leader as well as a team player. You bet he made mistakes as a first time politician as he did in real-estate  \"BUT\"  look at his accomplishments in less then 2 yrs! üëç\n\n  Most of us realize he's holding back till he gets a dependable House, Senate and a Congress, with a back bone. Then the fury of Hell is going to rain down on all those that are dirty cops! I expect to see many in the DOJ to resign or get prosecuted.\n\n  I would love to see Jeff sessions replaced with Rudy! That would shake up the CIA The FBI (PUKE) N/Y/C,  California, and New England. Over regulation and Taxation should be unacceptable by we the people. Look at the Free handouts for votes. They're all welfare states!üò†\n\n  Pres Trump will place his key Chess Players strategically in order to rain Hell and Damnation to the Swamp Rats slithering like the slime balls they are. They need total exposure. I expect them to pay for what they have done to our nation by dumbing down our youth that no longer have an understanding of the structure of The United States of America \"BUT\" vote at age 18 with immature brains!\n\n  Public schools don't need Union teachers. They need qualified and dedicated teachers like the ones I had when a student in small town America. We recited the Pledge of allegiance, the Lords Prayer and sang. We were taught Civics, US history, World history and Geography. In High school we were given choices of academics. Many chose vocational courses while others chose General and of course the College courses.\n\n  At age 17~18 we were prepared to advance into our country with open eyes. We had goals and proposed achievements that we chose to accomplish.\n\n  We live in a country that grants free opportunity for those with the fortitude to accomplish what our Non political President accomplished. Like it or not. Pres Trump accomplished the complete American dream. He's no ruler nor a dictator. He represents the USA, our Constitution, Bill of Rights and our culture for us the people of the USA\n\n  Pres Trump was willing to learn from his mistakes. He's willing to chose top quality people to staff himself. Of course some can be called minorities. Wake up Americans! It's not our Race, Creed, or Color that really matters. For each of us, it's becoming qualified to accomplish the impossible dreams that makes us a nation of Free opportunity for all. It's not about free food or free money for those physically fit or mentally fit to earn an honest living.\n\n  Our welfare System is setting up America for Socialism. Expanded government is not good for all. It enables a dictatorship like Puton accomplished in Russia after the Diminished the Soviet Union!  \n\n  Socialism of course is expanding our government. The government can and is a problem when it over regulates \"We The Republic\" That's who we are. The parties select and We the people elect \n \n  Rebuttals Accepted by those that read my statement for the content and not the person",

We all fear cops, we all bleed red, and we all got to survive some how. Why listen to the elite at all. What's the difference between a rich white man and a Rich black man? Nothing.

I'm so glad Trump won because say Pence was the President there would far less unforced errors, he wouldn't have pissed off even more women and he would have still gotten done all the evil but it was be more stealth.

Who endorsed Jesse Jackson for President, gave Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Push Coalition a free suite in Trump Tower, and was awarded The Ellis Island Award alongside Rosa Parks for his contributions to Black Americans, and gave Jennifer Hudson a free suite in Trump Tower when her family was murdered? Yes, Donald Trump. Easy to see who the real racists are and who is controlled by those racists. Just ask Paris Denard who was fired for standing up to the white racist CIA, globalist mouthpiece, Phil Mud.

Free expression is something that is never encouraged on the left. Far from it. But what the story also demonstrates is that the Democratic Party DEPENDS on certain demographic groups to vote their way and that is why they circle the wagons when a prominent figure like Kayne voices a contrary opinion.  For example,  the following demographic groups tend to vote Democratic: 84% of Blacks, 71% of Jews, 65% of Asians, and 63% of Hispanics.  Those demographic groups can clearly make a difference between a win and a loss in certain regions. And the Democratic Party needs to hold on to those percentages, which have come under threat to them in recent years. But the very idea that any individual of any group has to think and express a particular point of view, namely the Democratic Party narrative, is odious to any person who holds that free speech is an important individual right.",

Lack of employment in the inner cities leading to a life of crime for a lot of people\n5. The dangers of stop and frisk based on his conversation with leaders in Chicago and President was open to listening to other ideas even if he likes the idea of stop and frisk\n6. Love and Support for the President because he represents we the people\n7. Why the left's weaponization of the word racism doesn't have an effect on him. He lives for today not the past\n8. Learning Centers he wants to set up in Chicago so that young black kids can learn in a creative ways using modern technology instead of the current monotonous system of education that doesn't equip them with skills for the real world\n9. How Trump inspired him to do great things in the world of business especially with Adidas, leading him to become a billionaire \n10. Black people don't have to be democrats. \n\n\nNow, tell me how many times you have heard people talk about any of these important points in all the media coverage of Kanye's trip to the white house? \n\nAll the attacks were personal, not substantive. The most vicious attacks came from the left. It is clear that they are not interested in solutions, they are only interested in destroying people who think about solutions and want to implement them because it will cost them their strangle hold on the black vote and ultimately their power. \n\nKanye went to represent the forgotten people of Chicago and he was heard by president Trump. I believe good things will come from that meeting as long as he stays focused and keeps pushing for the projects he is working on. \n\nI refused to be fooled by the media, I have a brain and I will use it. \nKanye's trip to the White house was very inspiring for me and I never really liked him, but I appreciate what he is doing!",
