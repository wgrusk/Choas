why did the republicans even hold a hearing there was no debate i wont be surprised if  someday we find that justice kennedy was forced into an early retirement
amazing how he went from all americans to narrow minded democrats  shameful so much bs  yeah show your papers wheres the transparency kavanaugh flunked the job interview  he never judged a case he is biased and you cant protect him
democrats will not take the house
leftmind democrats need to be a little more discreet and stop losing all over themselves in public its pathetic
gee why cant everyone just get along
the liberal plan is if we cant beat them we will impeach them
it was sham of a public hearing because corroborating people were not called  theyre out there and theres even chance bk will be impeached
kavanaugh had nothing to thank the democrats forexcept for the one democrat that voted for him  i guess he could have thanked those that didnt make public statements against him based on liesif there was one
politically speaking my ballot is going to be red all the way
from the first time i ever heard chuck grassley speak back in the 1980s i have always thought his voice sounds like he is an oldtime movie actor from the filmnoir era
both parties are guilty of this  garland was not even considered
yeah better to ignore his lies under oath with his memory gaps and missinterpretations of his yearbook entry
senator grassley is an amazing man making iowans proud
the dems must know that theyve created a situation where centrists such as myself will never vote for them again so long as they shall live  those who are not loyal to parties but instead to their nations are coming to recognize that the democrats are a deeply corrupt party  which makes me wonder why they care nothing about the long game  and the logical answer seems to be  because were in their endgame and the long game is irrelevant  i really do believe that this is the last stand for freedom  vote for these people and due process wont be the only right you lose  allow them to continue using schools as indoctrination centers and you will be handing your nation away in the next generation  but allow them to dissolve due process and you will discover friends going missing under their next term
grassley is a millioinaire and taking millions from the farm aide trump just gave to farmers  crooks crooks crooks
liar grassley you need to step down i watched the hearings you and the republicans made up your own rules to vote on bills  you are suppose to have 10 republican votes plus 1 democrat to pass bills  you didnt have the  democrat vote but still passed bills  you and the republican party are crooked and cant be trusted 2018 is your year of getting out of office  get the white out
95 of all people on this planet called earth only care about their comfort zone and at anyone elses expense if necessary we do exist in a predatory society when the stock market crashes and it will and when that happens president trump will be despised  hated even by 95 of the deplorables president trump will learn the hard way that mr rothschild was  is right when he said he who has the gold makes the rules aka calls the shots people will hold president trump accountable for what the elite do president trump will then be hated above any other president people refuse to blame themselves for what they have allowed to happen they shift the blame watch the deplorables start shifting
these men are an embarrassment to the human race morons who have been voted into office with other morons these guys need to be voted out of office yesterday
its very wise to impeach each and every living republican law maker starting with dumb grassley
this should not be a political issue  it is nonpartisan  if your daughter complained about something like this you would also be upset
grassly would cry alligator tears
the dims want the sc so they can further their progressive agenda  therefore they will never go back to a collegial approach to confirm sc justices  i understand the desire to get along but the reality is that the left doesnt play well in the sandbox  senator grassley is an admirable man         iowa is lucky to have him
cory booker is a flaming homosexual conman from my home state new jersey
the dems are stupid the politicizing of the affirmation process is all on them their tds is warping their common sense
admire sen grassley he is a wise senator and leader awesome
why did you thank him for mr president trump cause he doesnt have the balls to investigate senator feinstein leakage what an idiot he he he
you are awesome chuck grassley we love  you here in iowa thanks for representing iowa
respect for sen grassley  hes wanting to do it right by the rules
civil war 20 is coming
chairman grassley is a spawn of satans foul jism
he saidan abominationbravo sir
the white women who put all the blame on the old white men they better start with their own dad
connye west just shitted in the oval office
obama incited racism  in his speeches he always mention about division which is a lie  hillary and obama used hitlers tactic which is tell a big lie and keep lying until they will believe you
grassley was a bully during the justice kavanuagh hearing  the republican has turned into a mean spirited flash mob  there behavior was a disgrace  the republicans have turned into a trump cult  a sad day for america
grassley is actually very dangerous for our country the senate judiciary committee on thursday advanced a slate of judicial nominees to the floor for a vote including jonathan kobes despite the fact that he was rated not qualified to serve on the circuit court by the american bar association fish rots from the head down
his voice is so annoying 
hold on why not  then impeach the whole heartless brains of damncrats too and then to be judged by the global court of multinationalists
liberals and their butthurt pals have impeach on the brain if they dont like it they want to impeach it
term limits
grassley ought to retire disgraceful
do those guilty of fraud just fade back into the panelingif it were you or i we would have been jailedlike insects they crawl away waiting to bite and spread their poisonarrest these criminals what are you waiting for  hell to freeze over come on trumpthey would not hesitate to impeach you 
senator grassley did a horrible job in confirming kavanaugh by not allowing the fbi to do a credible investigation onthe judge and having just 5 minutes  for senators to question kavanaugh  grassley did it to himself  also where arethe 100000 pages of kavanaughs work product that was requested but never given to the confirming committee
im starting to feel that orange wave
we need to an age limit on people in office of any kind these old men are out of touch with the world they are not fit they have become too old
wise words from a wise man
kavanagh was always opposed to roe v wade he even said so and laughed about it dont think he wont try to overthrow it  i just dont understand you supporters backing trump who is so divisive and dangerous that youll blindly support him youre country is sitting on a fence to civil unrest do any of you even know the history of the civil war  canada will welcome you with open arms when your country goes to crap lol and before anyone starts screaming at me for being right or left you actually had some decent republican presidents namely the one who presided over the civil war and got shot for it history about to repeat itself with civil unrest
if its not wise you can be sure a democrat will do it
fbi should look into ford and the dumbcrats feinstein
early voting begins 10222018 voting early will prevent long lines and you can update your voters registration information then too if you are not tired of winning vote gop all the way by voting gop all the way will give the presidents maga and kag agendas an easier pass in the house and senate lets make the red tsunami happen for president trump and vote gop all the way 10222018
grassley is wrong about that vile bimbo forddont call her dr politics as usual
contrast in values    restrained rule and spirit of the law versus ravening partisans ready to burn non democrats at the stake   democrats are scary
742 blonde asks can we keep killing the unborn babies
roe vs wade was based on a right nonexistent within the text of the us constitution and this is how it should be overturned on a constitutional basis  the right to privacy medical privacy or otherwise does not exist
sen grassley good job ford though is not credible and roe v wade based in a lie will be overturned
dems have been talking about impeaching trump for 2yrs now i wouldnt worry about them im not a republican but the dems did a horrible thing with kavanaugh it would be interesting to see a report on how many dems left the party because of this recent bullshit they pulled everybody is not stupid
okay lets bring up ginsberg for impeachment and see how they like it
chairman grassley is the best
i have been avoiding the news for a bit and came back to more weird left tactics
im not letting old fox watching seniors  red necks or hipocritans decide my future im voting blue all the way ftrump
avenatti creepy porn lawyer haha love tucker carlson
fair and throughout hearing does he believes that himselfhe has the same face as trump and kavanaugh  liars   he is too old  he should be put out on the pasture  before he can do more harm 
one day con don will ask kavanaugh a favor in return
how did blasey ford bring some credibility to the issue by faking the voice of a five year old to come across as cute or by setting up a million dollar gofundme scam if chuck grassley thinks she showed some credibility he can be fooled to easy that was an obvious scam with no credibility at all
not going to happen
why would he thank the democrats  they tried to stop him and didnt vote for him
if you have spent millions for a national socialist america an a new constitution you sure as hell would not want a constitutionalist judge on the supreme court 
this reporters questions are embarrassing dont search for diversity search for the most qualified position where does your idiotic diversity question take youwell mexico has too much mexicans therefore its racist thats the type of idiot thinking from the left and now a fox reporter is thinking it great
the man of god in trouble time god bless
not dividing america  these old dudes are from another time  unless they can take a time machine back to the 1970s1980s its too late to not divide america  the border wall needed to go up in the 70s
white anglo saxon protestant racist trash
what did he mean he thought blasely ford was credible bs it can only be a ploy to give her and her cohorts who still have to be flushed out a false sense of security i hope they are all hung out to dry and they must be
unwise  au contraire  it would be total dereliction of duty if they dont  fair and thoroughbullshit  its time you and your fellow dinosaurs get out of the way and let some real true servants of the people take over  bullshit to the max  there are only two old white men  what a crock
fox is not credible
dems will not divide us
mr chairman mr chairman mr chairman mr chairman mr chairman mr chairman mr chairman mr chairman mr chairman mr chairman mr chairman mr chairman
chuck grassley is a man of dignity and respect
why do they want us to match their violence so badly
i have studied all the laws written on treason and on impeachment what lies crime has brett kavanaugh committed to impeach from the supreme court  maxine watters the dumbest democratic female judas who yelled impeach 45 when asked how will you impeach oh we will impeach trump the same now used against justice kavanaugh  losers
grassley was doing fine until he started genuflecting to the   me too movement then he lost me
panda panda panda i dont care
i am a conservative republican who is ashamed for our party it is clear the gop hates women and americans trump is a criminal liar and traitor lock him upboycott fake fox news and sponsors
now youre stuck with the biblethumping nut job for life  what a stupid country

gorilla harris makes me wan barf when i see her
attention all stupid morons  you can only impeach a federal official for high crimes and misdemeanors committed while in office
potus has to want to impeach first
its pretty sad that obama stated that the show house of cards is the most accurate representation of washington politics there is frank underwood is a sociopath and a murderer hes also a democrat
hafor whatfor someones opinion with motiveand that made 800k on a go fund me siteok
i am not american i am not white my colour is more like hispanic i dont agree that white men are bad and feel that they are masters and better than others  in fact the first to have black slaves are the arabs  they used to cross the red sea and catch the poor africans  this was hundreds of years before the europeans invaded africa  i do not deny that europeans after having discovered america they needed people to work in the fields perhaps it was at that time that the white man started catching africans to sell them in americawhile the white man did many wrongdoings it was the white man that developed science the best example is sir issac newton he had no slaves he was dedicated to mathematics and natural philosophy know as physics today laplace the french mathematician james clerk maxwell the scottish mathematical physicist carl friedrich gauss the german physicist and many others who lived during the time when the slave trade was legal yet they didnt have slaves their contribution to human knowledge cannot be overstated all were white menmaybe many of those who will read this comment know that there are slaves today in some arab countries
whos second
lol cant impeach him  lol
sore losers i hate democrats
the republicans knew that kavanaugh was qualified to be on the supreme court and the democrats knew he was qualified to be on the supreme court they just didnt want him to be simply because they were hoping to win the midterms its all a question of power as for dr ford she was easily manipulated by evil people and enjoyed the faked fame shame on her
i really like sen grassley hes so wise and level headed
i have grown more and more of adoration towards to these old gentlemen in the good old party
time to putaway thosethat preyon othersmany areguilty ofimposingtheir willthe vampiresroam both islesfrom the topof societyto the homelessstreets
you cant impeach someone who hasnt been in office yet they were screaming to do the same with trump  idiots  fool
golberd and osbourne been seeing those commercials since the 1990s
old white men disgusting statement by the senseless left
impeach him for what actuallyred wave in november whats it matter
dr ford brought credibility to the sexual assault issue what are you nuts mr grassly fords story changed it had holes in it ford couldnt member key events from a couple of weeks ago ford told lies about being afraid to fly to washington and about the reason a second door was added to her house ford wouldnt release all the information from her therapist ford wouldnt release the entire lie detector test that she took and the most important fact of the case every one of fords corroborating witnesses including a lifelong friend have refuted fords claim that kavanaugh sexually assaulted herno mr grassly ford has zero credibility that she was sexually assaulted by kavanaugh or anyone else and she should have been rode out of town on a rail for politicizing sexual assault in order to gain power for the democratsps grassly is getting old and feeble and its time for him to retire as chairman of the judiciary committee
why would justice kavnaugh thank the morons that tried to railroad him i will also send money to support senator collins in her next election runso done with these beyond stupid liberals ready for civil war see what you crybaby piece of poop liberals do when we start hitting back its timedont tread on me or else
l have the utmost respect for senator chuck glassley and im a democratic but that will change as soon as i can get to the court house
no its time sir ford faces a federal inquiry and answer for her lies
705 freedom of speech being down trodden again 3m against someone who has the right of free will we all have it vote and let the red wave flow over the blue sea of crime
honorable man
sorry to say this but i find her annoying
the problem started because someone did not approve someoneor did we forget about that    i guess once the other party gets elected they will do the sameif one cheats then the rules changed i guess
grassley your awesomejust as a soldier sir you are a true patriot
god bless this man we need more like him to reveal logic in this land
it wasnt very wise to push kavanaugh through in the first place there were other justices just as qualifiedthe only reason why they stuck with kavanaugh was because donald chump wanted himany idiot can see that
why the heck doesnt the gop go all out and investigate fords scrubbed online presence her alleged shady connections and every lead expressed by conservatives online why dont they investigate and challenge the biased words and attitudes of the dems from the time kav was nominated through to his swearing ingop traditionally gets outplayed by the dems what i see is a young generation on the left outplaying old folks on the right pisses me off every time surely i am not robinson crusoe feeling like this
truth is taken seriously not ford
her voice is aweful
hey martha it was not a contentious confirmation it was a democratic disgrace of misconduct and complete fascist aim at undoing civility and the rule of law
the democrats disgraced themselves in the kavanaugh hearings and showed a huge lack of integrity and civility  if you dont like what you saw get out and vote them out wherever  possible
no kavanaugh thanked joe manchin a democrat get it right martha
god bless america
these low class democrats are the worse than a bad snake they should be legislating in venezuela or nicaragua where there are rabbles or rag tag chusmas in spanishvote for decency vote against anarchy vote for a great america vote against leftistcommunist democrats vote for all republicans in midterm november 2018
democrat farleft demagoguery pandemonium tantrum bulling threatening intimidating slandering strategy will not carry the political winning ticket this is not what america is about
sorry chuck ford brought nothing but lies and democrat deceit to the inquiry
too bad they appointed kavanaughnow the democrats are motivated enough to possibly sweep all the seats in both chambersand impeach kavanaugh  and probably that other dudemcconnell will eventually regret setting fire to the rule book  genies out of the bottle now bitches
kavanaugh reminds me of edward nortons movie primal fear he hid his evil part
keep you friends close and your enemies closer antiquefotos
grassley is a dinosaur that stated females would not be able to do the work load of a senatorhis bias is appaling
a us circuit court judge having to explain stupid jokes from his high school yearbook about drinking with friends and flatulence in order to get confirmed to the supreme court this is outrageous blumentha is a proven liar and cory bookeris an admitted groper wow
if the uber corrupt dems try to do this then this is no longer just partisan politics but outright sedition and treasontime to cue the firingsquad
dems act like they can impeach some body for the hell of it if that were the case trump wouldnt have been in office a full day
did grassley say that ford was believable   now that is ridiculous
liberalsdemocrats are antiamerican
with the corporate fascist pawns white republicon men in congress we will never impeach this woman hating creep kavanaugh  what we can do is let chief justice roberts know that his court is illegitimate and irrelevant and we will not take any of their rulings seriously  we should urge our local and state representatives to disregard their faulty and fake legal rulings
i love how this girl open her mouth she hides those teeth very well
i hope they do it  let them disclose their nature and who they work for who are behind them to corrupt the work against american people
kavanaugh need not worry 23 of the senate will never vote to impeachneverthe same goes for trump
the kavanaugh debacle reminded me of all those leftists who wanted amanda knox to rot in an italian prison for a crime she didnt commit  they knew she was guilty because you know body language  plus it was unfair to accuse a black refugee with a history of burglary and second story breakin while carrying a knife as a weapon of lying  it was we must believe the refugee just as with kavanaugh we must believe the highly prejudiced leftist victim no matter how illogical her story is
the dems cant get out of their own way
this is faux news a big lol
corkyboob is a joke should have heard him on stage i think it was wyoming cspan at the heritage road to the white house last week friday comparing himself and the dimwhits cause equal to the mlk marching over the bridge and selma alabama somebody should have thrown a halfdozen shoes at his head and got him off stage
blue with a trail of red dripping dictatorship trailing behind
there are no grounds to impeach justice kavanagh and it is an over with conversation the supreme court stands unified with all 9 justices why do you think they were all there at the swearingin
sexual misconduct is taken seriously only if they are republicans
my mother in law is one of those people who thought hillary would be a competent presidentyeah i know but even she thought the kavanaugh witch hunt was repulsive and a partisan hit job she really doesnt like trump either but recognizes you need a reason to impeach someone not liking someone doesnt make them a criminal i have to respect that but all the same can someone who might otherwise not vote in november please do so and cancel out her vote  please
dear all i share with you my story about volunteerism in counterrorism operations for over a year from gestures and outfits of vs zombies i make messages about where attacks can happen and what terrorists would do in europe but this knowledge is not enough to stop terrorism therefore most important thing is people start protests against terrorism in europe i believe if states of europe had stopped payments to refugees a war would have started in europe therefore i ask money from rothschild banking system for armies to protect people and for hackers working in counterrorism operations
how old is this guy
why isnt congress arresting these criminals not following federal laws we have sanctuary cities an no one is arresting them
feminism isnt of god it is the work of the devil you bitches deserve sharia law stay in line
trump better slow down becouse hes winning way too much  from the economy to kim jun un to daca to the wall to kicking hillarys ass to brett kav the left might just try and assasinate him  he winning to much  ooooohhhhhhhhhh they dont like when he wins
isnt grassley the multi millionaire in congress sucking the taxpayers teat for farmer tariff relief
simply just tell the dems to f off
i have a question  where the hell is ms ford  probably somewhere sipping maitais  enjoying the big payout she got for her role in the fuckery 
you need a god fearing women on the commity  demoncrats have the opposite in their women  wanting gays to be married  lgbtq parades and gender equality isnt god like at all  think of it that waygod made adam and eve not adam and steve no one should get praise but yah parades should be held for jesus and god god dont think of us as equal  men are the head of every house hold the women supposed to fall in line and be submissive to their man this new wave of women want equality but want you to foot the bill for everything  equal pay in which i support  women shouldnt hold high ranking possitions they should not preach the word of god not my words gods word said this soon america will burn all bibles  im not with that id leave to another country 
dr ford gave 0 credibility why are you sugar coating 
you need 23 of senate will never happen get over it
ford fraud demonkkkrats just scream impeachment all they knowhillary lost get over it
love senator grassleylinsay grahamsusan collins for standing up for judge kavanaugh
 im sorry did he just say the way they treated thomas so in his mind anita hill is the villain of that pierce of history
dont like him  to old scool
senator grassley was the 1st senator getting the truth about the fast and furious debacle which obama never answered to god bless senator grassley
i thought dr ford brought credibility pff give me a break i think she lied through her teeth and it was such an act she should be charged with perjury
the dems think they can impeach a justice on past events that may or may not have happened but that is not how it works a scotus has to do something on the court to be impeached for if kavanaughs behavior is impeccable he will not be impeached as for other current justicesthat is another story yet to be revealed corruption is possible at any time judges have always been susceptible to being blackmailed
senator grassley said that christine fords testimony was credible i guess he was listening to somebody else speak the four people that christine ford named as witnesses completely disavowed her
grace needs to prevail  resist the urge to answer fools according to their folly and become like them
fantastic job mr grassley well done its good to have men like you serving the people
dems strategy is to work the storey of fbi investigation wasnt good enough  yet they actually dont want this going deeper since it would implicate the dem party into trying to get witnesses to change there sworn statements among other thingsthere will never be charges against kavanaugh  only talk of bs to try and keep the dem voters angry  best thing ever would be to dig further and out the whole thing as a planned hitthat is clearly was designed to do
thank you senator grassley
k gramps
i hope kavanaugh sues the accussers  just trump did 2 his accusers all of the 19 of themnikki haley 2020
chairman grassley i am proud of your choice of words   i am an american first i love my puerto rican heritage but i am an american first i will defend america with all my heart and soul i quote teddy roosevelt when he was asked what race he was  i love my heritage but im an american im a strong believer your either an american or your not
nina pina and the santa maria
you thought this ine was bad just wait until trump get a third nomination its going to be even worse
senator grassley is a rare gem his common sense approach has brought him a huge group of followers throughout the usa always good to hear from him
i wish chuck was my grandpa
439  stop saying dr ford brought credibility  it was obvious from the start she was being manipulated and paid by soros or someone else to lie and she was more than willing to go along with it  the bogus lie detection and the fake squeaky voice without any tears was mere acting dr ford is mentally unstable and without any corroboration it was clear she was merely projecting what she wished had happened onto an innocent brett kavanaugh  as of today on gofundme dr ford is 616603 richer  is was worth her while to bear false witness at least in this life not the next
justice kavanaugh thanked democrat joe manchin martha  kavanaugh and manchin were bipartisan
the swamprat demorats dont understand that they only strengthed president trump bret kavanaugh the gop and the american voters november 6 2018 lets paint our nation red
they always bring abortion into it abortion was illegal from the beginning why didnt someone ask them then and why dont someone ask them now why did we legalize a law in 1973 that was legal in the soviet union in 1920the supreme court is suppose to rule according to the constitution of the usa not the ussr why didnt someone point this out to them maybe they just ignored their sworn duties and sold us out to the ussr
the demonrat mob
the big error in thinking comes in definitions republicans think they are elected to represent all the people and so must consider everyones concerns even trump says to make america great for all americans   democrats believe they are elected to push through their personal iberalprogressive agenda unconcerned about the conflicting views of the people in their district who did not vote for that using lies and deceit to cover their tracks and using claims of social injustice to hide their motives total difference in definitions and philosophy the left demands a concession here a concession there and never gives back so after 40 years they have everything they need to take over and dictate their terms to everyone obamacare    you have to approve it to see whats in it
what a clown grassley is not one word about kavanaughs obvious unsuitability due to lying under oath and partisanship come on what kind of judge threatens things like what goes around comes around while interviewing for the highest judicial job in the world yes he actually said that yikes and what kind of interviewer doesnt bring those glaring deficiencies up
look at the two main antagonisers schummer and soros what do they have in common yes you got itall through history some of them have turned people against people within a nation russia is the primeexample 1917 then play the victim card not all are bad but the upper circle areall the diversityglobalismmulti culti politics are all backed by them time people see these elite for whatthay are
republicans should be proactive and start preemptive impeachment procedings against baderginsberg immediately she cant even keep from falling asleep during a 12 hour photo session unfit to serve  strike first and hard stop being so weak we elect you to institute our policies and our values yet you bend over backwards to accomodate every request the left makes weak men do that not leaders
its ok to be whiteand older
dems spout descriptive words of behavior that they dont follow negative behavior then they blame republicans
the party out of power is supposed to play dirty tricks to get back into power but the allout assault on america by the democrat campaign sleazes is too much to allow the elected representatives of both parties are supposed to first look out for the country  instead they are slavishly following their advertising agency political parties in a sure path to the destruction of us alland we vote for these partisan vicious clowns
norma mccorvey  red pill
dems are the party of hate  the party of slavery the party of kkk the party of jim crow
we have an execuiv sezzion
end partisan politics abolish all political parties  it is horribly inefficient to have a practice where in the final year of a presidents term that the senate judiciary committee chairman not put forward a nomination given by the president  it might be politically polite and honorable but it slows us downfor the efficiency of our country there should be term limits on every branch of our government not only in the executive but in the legislative as well as the judiciaryi also believe that there should be a second string that continues to do the work of congress when congress menwoman are absent for whatever reason sick dead vacation family time just dont feel like coming in to workwe have grown enormously in physical size and population  from the time that our union was first conceived we are now old enough and experienced enough to know what we want for our country so its high time that we change our constitution to reflect exactly what we want the constitution should be up for review and vote every 100 yearsgiven all of the above these changes will have a positive impact on our economy
yeah so when you  get  through  dribbling  and  drooling  take  off  the  tinfoil  helmets  and  how  about  this trump  is  a  traitor  and  all  those  who  aid  and  abet  his  treason  are  traitors  as  well he  was  a  traitor  the  moment  he  called  on  putin  to  attack  the  election  and  an  american  citizen  on  national  television that  putin  did  just  exactly  that  is  proof  in  the  pudding so knowing this and continuing to support a traitor president  makes you a traitor too  congratulations
impeachment is the only way to clear up this mess what a disaster that gop couldnt find a better candidate wisdom for sure is something this grassley doesnt need to think or worry about he produced this mess in the first place
god bless my countryplease everyoneplease get out the votethe hate you see is not a movie it is real its not just something you see on tvit is realim not someone who would normally say this butdefend your self against violence timeno one should be hit by baseball bats or stones or mob violencei am not going to be injuredi will defend myself
kavanaugh will be impeached for lying to congress and to the fbi 
this just shows how reckkess and unhingrd the left is im an indep voter who had voted for democrats but not anymore they lack integrity and honor
dear democrat pieces of filth  kavanaughs in you lose start sucking on it
grassley is far more gracious than i would have been i am fuming this whole thing is disgusting vote red
we can tell that criptkeeper dart vader ginsberg is already a zombie and they will keep her walking corps moist and robotically moving until her skin falls off at least until 2020
democrats and libs have turned our system into something ugly  democrats are disgusting and anyone who still votes for them today truly needs to look at themselves in a mirror and evaluate themselves very seriously
i think grassleys last statement puts one or more of the conservative justices lives in danger if a case against liberals or abortion gets to the floor of the court before 2020
former liberal here  sooo glad to see key members of the gop swamp starting to come aboard the trump train maga winning
god bless grassley
the left is following the play book left to them by saul alinsky called rules for radicals which was the guiding light in obamas life and followed in his days as a community organizer even when he was in the white house he never really stopped being one the main purpose of his eight years in office was to help develop many more as we see now and will continue to no doubt as the future of this country is fought over i suggest everyone become more familiar with that book or videos about it because its all laid out in there as to what these people are trying to do to overthrow the united states and turn it in to some sort of tyrannical pure democracy if thats even possible since a pure democracy is not really what we should want
senate judiciary committee chairman go fund me cough drop 
what does kavanaugh and his wife do regarding their two daughters and going to school even private which i would think is where they were attending if they werent homeschooled already think about it knowing how on hinged on the left is seems to me they cant go anywhere without security and have to be homeschooled since why would you take a chance
hand full of protesters not very represented of everyone so its just shock news
we the people get to vote to confirm judge kavanaugh on nov 6 vote republican or america is lost
the democrats are at war with american values and laws     this has nothing to do with issues like abortion   it is the leftist quest for absolute power so they can transform us into a third world poop pit 
fox news blacklisted michael savage  they are fkn trash
i have one question did the democrats and activist actually believe professor fords claims or were they just playing along  i know they repeated over and over that they believed her but i wonder if it was just a play along trying to get everyone else to believe  i guess deep down i wonder if she was a made up victim by the democrats or a actual victim taken advantage of by the democrats
it waswise to elect kavanaugh to the supreme court  ignorant biased and downright lying git grassley  what a stupid man even dumber than trump if he thinks we didnt see what went on 
grassley is a abominable cuck
i like how so called  conservative fox protects the rioters on the left because lets face it fox news is owned and run by liberals
whatttttt now kavanaugh is supposed to thank the demo rats for trying to evicerate him give us a break people vote these thugs and their mob rule out
at what point are we going to enforce the rule of law we have the gaurantee clause of the us constitution the sedition act the internal security act and the communism control act why are we not enforcing those laws to stop those maoist cultural revolution the radical left is pushingit seems mccarthy was right
if you want to change the landscape of the congress then you need to start with shutting up and throwing the 2 biggest political assholes of all time in jail obummer and clinton those 2 alone have damned near destroyed this country and everything it stands for
 if im chairman i wont take it upand theres you repubilcan party and why they end up losing
i dont know any conservatives that watch fox i do know liberals and repubilcans who do though hmmmmmm
fox has become cnn light nothing but gotcha
pathetic weak assed republicants will allow demokkkrats to take over  grassley is a perfect example of this  i hope not
fox whipping up their leftist operatives roe v wade hysteria 50 years nowand fox is right there to legitimize the psychosis on the left

and this is so called conservative fox
old rinos are just as bad as younger ones all the same mimeographwomen dont lie lgbtq pure as the driven snow so tiring
fox has become unbearable cnn litealways running interference for demokkkrats
conservatives still think fox is on their side look who owns and runs fox theres your answer
 we can work in a bipartisan way typical rinos
grassley let it go on this long demokkkrats ran it
repubilcans still wont call out that all the violence is coming from the left all of it
kamal toe harris and cory are two dumb iffes
if the dems seek impeachment against kavanaugh it will backfire on them and the corruption deep and entrenched in the supreme court will be exposed something connected to the ruling of the homo marriage law will be exposed and it will result in the removal of three justices
they couldnt impeach trump what makes them think they can impeach kavanagh
vote red so they  cant  try impeachment  against  both this is our constitutional  rights democrats  want to take  away
three men that really stood out in this fight against demoncrat evilness were grassley graham and ted cruz graham really showed he has some fire in his belly 
truth and honesty won the dayas it should
grassley needs to go then at least before 2020 the distractocrats have declared all out war now so screw their not in an election year bs chucky schumer even tried to change it to any election year which would mean effectively every other year so since they dont adhere even to their own rules screw any of their rules
feminism eats itself
if ginsberg cant cite the constitution off the top of her noggin surely she cant have long left she not got it all up there to make sense sorry bye bye ginnybang another rep judge in there just to make sure
dr ford was not credible  stop saying that shes credible  her story is ridiculous  her exboyfriend made a sworn testimony to the fbi that she is a liar  its proven that she was a liar  she has no evidence  she has no witnesses  she has no corroboration  she completely scrubbed the internet of herself a month before this came out  her polygraph was a joke  nothing about her is credible
a lawyer for the porn world lol
im not an american just watching from a little way away the more i watch the more i come to the conclusion that democrats are all enemy combatants they are fighting to bring down your american constitution and as enemy combatants i can only encourage actual americans to act accordingly towards them
stop being so sensible dont you realise youre on fox
good for grassey
he looks like billy bob thorton in that old pic
we cant let infractions against women detract from his career abused women should stop trying to stop abusers from being judges over women in america if you get 60 abused women you can get one bill cosby you would need at least 45 abused women to take down one kavanaugh
wrong   the dnc commiecrats have acted and will act like a cornered bobcat because they have no other strategy losersliars rant and rave when exposed
patriotism is the virtue of the vicious
schumer made a speech and kept a hispanic judge from the supreme court  why isnt that making headlines
actually a really good interview and good interviewer
taxpayers who are pro lifeanti abortion shouldnt fund abortions
we love youmaga msga from swedengod bless president trump and the great people of usa and swedenjustice and his family has been in my thoughts since the first hearing where his daughter had to leave cause of the leftistsyou are a strong nation with independent patriotic peopleyou give hope to all antiglobalist conservatives around the globeagain from my heart thank you all from a humble swede proudly in active  service since 1992vilja mod uthllighetwill courage staminaparatrooper sf k3you are all heroes standing up against the leftist oppression
if it was real deep impact y did ford just drop the issue oh she got her 
he wants women and hispanics to rule over him
kavanaugh innocent why is ford not in jail for slander perjury and posism
the damage the democrats have done to themselves and the ridiculous riots in portland arent helping  assaulting senior citizens driving by in the passenger cars isnt helping your causethe zombies on the last follow maxines orders to intimidate innocent people  predict the democrats are going to pay dearly in the midterms
grassley is a good man and the demoncrats are just that  possessed
the democrats and leftists want to impeach anyone who doesnt go along with their idiology
wow this female interviewer is a biased cntwhat was revealed about kavanaugh nothing was revealed about him other than he was rightfully outraged by the witch hunt and propaganda against him and rightfully pointed out the extremely partisan attack on him and his familykavanaugh thanked only republican senators what the holy fuck does he have to be thankful for from the democrat senators they were the most repugnant of simpleminded genderbaiting propagandists engaging in an outrageous witch hunt
ginsberg and bayer got votes because they are  jewish all these left opposition is jew shadow deep state behind doing it america is not talmudist country not christian
whats his problem with ub40
great interview
great american
when youre vacuuming a fetus out of a womb does it it feel pain
i kinda admire grassley for his wise comments
everytime you see another dem video report it as spam
dems are reached new low  shame on them  republicans and that one lone wolf  dem came through  senator collins is a true republican lady and  she has integrity they cant take that away red tsunami  in november
brett kavanaugh should have also thanked the dems for ruining his squeaky clean reputation
if ford feels she was sexually assaulted by kavanaugh she should open a case with the police if she still feels he got away with it but she wont as it was purely a political tactic and she wont be heard from again as the dems need to find another pawn to get kavanaugh now hes justice all of it is a game to the demon rats
without russian help trump would not have been president
i am a biologist and when people says fetus feel no painthats bsthere is evidence when feels pain the number is very low as 22 weeksbut the courts and lawmakers used a social definition of painyes socialrequiring the fetus to understand and have an emotion obviously because of tech limitations we can not do a brain scan of the primitive brain of a fetusyet we can measure the activity of pain receptors and yes you wont say a lobster doesnt feel pain when boiled alive same as a fetus basically in evolutionary terms that have similar brains with the human fetus with higher neuron count
try it demonrats youll see an ass whooping at the voting booths the likes youve never seen and will never hold power again youre so stupid you just pissed off the scotus that tips the scales 
all day long
my impression was that he had asked some women to serve on the judiciary committee and the women he asked declined because of the workload it wasnt that women in general cant handle the workload it was just that the women he asked declined because of the workload similar to declinations by many male senators due to the workload good lord hes old but its not like he was in his 80s back in the 40s and 50s
he didnt only thank republicanshe thanked joe manchin
creepy porn lawyer avenatti touched me believe me
white and proud
did kavanagh not thank mancin in his speech so saying he only thanked republicans isnt true 
divided at grass roots because some of us are americans and some are illegal aliens on welfare
for a second i was taken aback by grasselys statement that if there is a vacancy during 2020 that there will be no voting on a new justice  but bearing in mind what happened in 2016  im for letting the voters decide again 
i simply cant stand any more nonsense about kavanaughhow about investigating who handled ford and abused her silly fragile mind in a fraudulent and reckless attempt to block trumps nominee its already evident feinstein knew the attempt to be a abortive hail mary  and didnt care but there must be a money trail and a trail of documents to illustrate the machinations behind this abuse of the senate the nominee and probably ford herself and if ford wasnt a victim of evil manipulations shouldnt she then stand trial for leveling false accusations against an innocent man  or perhaps be remanded from a position teaching psychology to a mandatory treatment for criminal insanity
the only   people who found ford credible are dumb or hypocritical she is a professor of psychology and yet she used a little girl voice and terminology on the polygraph episode she said that when she was connected to the machine she was scared all in a little girl voice       she an expert  professor on polygraphs 
hawaii for trump vote red 2018 midterms
caption folllows too late
you are just wasting your time democratsserve your time for for the good of the american people
please democrats moves on forget your foolishness
and thanks to those enemies of mine who showed america and the world stage how corrupt they are

give to susan collins campaign
 they need to leave that damn man alone now theyve done enough to him for their bullshit political agenda
impeach on what ground
investigate the liberal media
repubs need to get out the vote in november
dr ford needs to be thrown in jail and loser her job and title
great job chairman grassley 
chuck g minces no words  cheers
time for trump to release the fisa documents about hillary obama and every other scandel like 911 jfk and so on time to nail the corrupt bastards
ginberg kagan sotomayor need to go
why in gods world would he thank the dirty dems one tiny speck of an iota at all they did nothing but spew their filthy mouthed hatred and lies the whole time
please hurry to create the keep susan collins fund  i will contribute
no policy no platform no record democrats vote for me im going to impeach everyone stupid dim wits
its not possible to impeach kavanaugh this is a political tactic by the democratic elite to herd the sheep they know its impossible it takes 23 of the senate to impeach thats 67 senators so if the dems win every race in 2018 which is extremely unlikely the most votes they would have is 58 in addition they actually would have to have a reason to impeach its never going to happen if you are a d ask yourself why are the elites promoting something that is impossible
fox news is still better than cnn because cnn now has a homophobic female reporter named kaitlin collins
i cant wait for november
much love chairman grassley
omg his view is the total opposite of the witch clinton clinton says civility will not return until they mange to take back the house and senate 
what are they gonna impeach him for he didnt do anything just like president trump
is grassley actually  a senator in your countrylol
clevermanhe feed the boyfriends letter the miss mitchael and got to see this shank lie to his satisfaction sandbaged  the demon rats operationperjury charges should follow and as senblumenthal the certified liar stated as he began to question kavanaugh the jury can choose not believe a witness if they catch them in a liethey can throw out the entire statementshe got caught in a least a half dozen liesjust the facts mame
if you believe brett kavanaughs calenders from 1982  over fords polygraph test  you might be a republican alternate facts
when do liberals do anything that is wise they dont their ideas are worthless and their practices are raw sewage
great interview up to the abortion bullshit  its law ok its never going away like it or not thats what it is  quit trying to make a story where there isnt one
diversity means incompetence
complete bullisht this should not be allowed to continue and booker and his pals should be held accountable
shalom and thanks for your video now i must issue a warning  if anyone has denied the name of our lord jesus christ repent and confess his name befoe men ask for his holy spirit because rapture and sudden destruction is imminent time is up love you all
none of them can say judiciary right lol
so many people are freaking out about hurricane michael hitting another red state  i dont know why everyone is so upset  there is no global warming and when people start drowned bag and stuff our president will jizz in his daughters face and make her ambassador to the un  maga
the people that run the democrat party are in fact now marxistswho historically have always openly called for the utter destruction of the united states of america we have every reason to believe that these marxists bastards will engender upon all who follow them to commit  acts of deception and pure evil  as they did with judge kavanaugh  to scare good people of good conscience who love this country its founders and its supreme liberating document the constitution it may come to a civil war and it may not whatever the decision will be no price will be to high to pay to avoid losing our nation and its constitutional heritage to these slithering socialist scoundrels as in times pastkeep your bible your loved ones and your guns close by
ford brought credibility     no  fbi thorough investigation   america is  fake
if ginsberg falls hed be dumb to not move forward judge amy barrett
impeaching someone with no good reason what about arresting all those corrupt criminal politicians and government officiala heaps of evidences and witnesses dead and alive this is the very resson justice needs to be meted out on the wrong for the right
grassley is amazing
when democrats take control of congress they will instruct the fbi to launch a full investigation without restrictions and without their hands being tied  all witnesses that wanted to be interviewed by the fbi must be interviewed further if  kavanaugh lied and committed perjury under oath that must also be investigated by a democratic controlled congress
america is under attack from the democrats its your choice to stand up get out and vote or lay down and let them win
sen grasslys 1st class all the way
state media
i never knew that judiciary could also be impeached
the latest rumor is that antifa is planning to stop conservatives from voting one of the many tactics they are planning is to stop traffic to voting pols and only letting thru people who they believe will be voting their way the plan is to harass people going to the polls and prevent them from actual voting they are also looking for ways to hack the voting machines and change the votes
you cant just impeach someone because you dont want them there what will these people do or say if proof is found hes innocent i bet they wouldnt even apologize
he wimped out  we need a strong fighter call him he must pursue gord documents and investigate senate dems for conspiracy hit job  or mid terms are effed
corey booker has no integrity hes nothing more than a jester a clown
this old devil needs to die and so does the rest of white evil america and take the hateful blacks too just leave us lgbt and indians lol
two white devils on my screen wtf
if the house wins the majority i would be totally shocked if they didnt try for a article of impeachmentso lets say they pass that then there is one final step leftits turned over to the senate for a trial to be found guilty and removed immediately from office  this would require 70 votes in favor this is what makes it tough to impeachask bill clinton he was found not guilty by the senate then his poll numbers went up 
if there was a civil war in the country you would see a lot of dead libtards
let the demonic dems try and we will see what happens
susan collins is definitely a feminist feminists are the scum of the earth susan collins needs a primary challenge from the right
wow i actually learned something from an interview with a politician grassleys chronology of the politicization of the federal judiciary explains a lot
democrats  have no message they are masters  of deception american people  are awake
hey joe manchin  be our hugo stiglitz see inglorious bastards movie the red majority will welcome you by flipping be a part of history in maga d
this bimbo reporter completely ignored the fact that kavanaugh did in fact thank munchen a democrat todays so called reporters are weak theyre nothing but gossips not researchers
talk about an understatement mrgrassley
feminists are vicious spoiled women and men who are trying to get whoknowswhatelse for women because there is nothing they dont have rights positions or property feminism is the cancer that cant be cured
senator chuck grassley a stalwart patriot
grassley is being too politically generous surely his long standing relationship with the ds should be preserved but theyve already laid down a gauntlet with hillarys de facto threat today the time for civility will be after the elections talk about notsohidden meaning i want hillary in jail now to stop her crime spree and as they say keep her away from decent people
grassley walks on eggshells too much for my liking hes an old fool if he thinks these young liberal senators are going to play nice he may be a good guy but i think he needs to be replaced with a more conservative more cognitive 30 year younger replacement right now he is 85 years old for petes sake that is ridiculous washington needs new blood besides term limits there should be age limits 100 year old senators is crazy
most of americans not left coast or cali bullying coast are  supporting our process  ignore the idiot protesters who are being paid by leftist organizations  but yeah fbi needs to investigate these organisations hopefully this next election   were watching legal voting and illegal voting   sorry but dead people should not be voting
the only individuals worthy of being thanked by kavanaugh are the the republicans
ahhhh leave it to fox news and its ill follow along without question anchors to point out the 2 african american senators to oppose brett kavanaugh at his hearing off the bat in this interview if senator grassley actually cared to not divide among races he would of declined to answer the question by the anchor its that simple but go ahead and believe republicans are good people
wise men
only 27 days until midterm elections nov 6th 2018   all american citizens vote republican nov 6 2018 call family friends neighbors coworkers drive them to polls help them w mail in ballots  democrats threaten america favor illegal aliens over citizens globalism over americanism guilty until proven innocent wo evidence  vote republican to keep america great
stop giving this stooge woman ford credibility proven liar proven puppet of feinstien
christine fraud is not a doctor she is not listed anywhere as a doctor of psychology in california she is a specialist in hypnosis and retrieved memory and fictitious memory making look it up yourself she is a plant by the democrats and all this was purposely done she used victimization as a weapon
merrick garland the republicans held the senate in 2016 they were not obligated to rubber stamp the nominee of a lame duck president
grassley is 99 percent correct and has used very accurate transparent language to describe the context of pollution in the process by the ideologically infected expectations that favor tabloid trash intern impeached democrat demands unfortunately he knows the obstruction to reason fairness logic truthfulness that our corrupt dnc take such pride in not only causing but escaping accountability from will be encouraged by components only interested in political control for controls sake granted its still encouraging to observe him and his colleagues take the high road when few who matter would criticize him for going low or more linguistically lethal the dirty dems impeachment threats are attacks on our institutions by any journalism standards but if it is not president trump his policies or his appointments being judged unfairly then obviously our humiliated clinton catastrophe crew press become instantly confused and refuse to correctly cover which is another thank you julie and fox news moment as well lol
let the democrats try impeach kavanaugh itll add millions of conservative votes to the tally
these idiots are sure earning their new name dumbocrats  lol  yeah impeach a conservative scotus before the 2020 prez election is an ironcladguarantee of trumps reelection  why is the marxistleft so stupid
impeach him for what these people are nuts
those leftist loonies is a joke i think of cartoon characters more seriously than i do of those leftist loonies agendas
a true man of principle thank goodness he was leading the committee 
thank you chuck grassleythank you judge k  family for your selfless sacrifice to save our great country you all should be treated like royaly  thank god our father in heaven for the patriotic soldiers you all are you have given us all a very special gift we can now feel secure in our counyry  homes that our rights  freedoms will be protected god has used you all to show his power through you  thats amazing to me thank you god bless you and let no weapon formed against you prosper  every tongue that rises up against youus in judgement weyou will condemn
wow he is pos old white man so much hatred and entitlementbut as the rah rah team of trumpetswinning however i must ask what does it profit a man to gain the world and lose his soul after the debacle of confirming a drunk angry and sexual predator to a lifetime jobyes i said job most people will never respect the supreme court again after this  nor him but kavanaugh doesnt careas he states i drank beeri went to yalei deserve this appointment interesting that he began his job interview with how he was the soccer dadhow he loved his daughterslet us hope that they get more respect than what has revealed during his job interview
the democrats are right on the verge of starting the civil war
impeach ginsburg for being dead
demoncrates will do whatever it takes to keep on legally murdering and slaughtering babies they hate god and love sacrifices innocent children
there will be no impeachment  but a real good chance of a blood bath
1201 just another reason the 90s were greatd
all the hubbub is to exhaust the electorate get a friendly congress and exhonerate or bury hillary clintons misdeeds period after shes dead id consider relaxing
anyone who says that kavanaugh is a good man  for     the sake of gods truth please do research the facts about this popejesuit disciple brett kavanooh  dig    deeply and find the pattern  the trend how he used his   judicial knowledge  they were all for the favored elite oligarchs and corporatists  how kavanaugh was a puppet to americas masters of the nwo the bushes  or you are not of the truth because you do not hear the voice of god  do you have personal relationship with our lord jesus christ    examine yourself  naive gullible 
dont republicans relish in doing what the majority doesnt want
god the left is so racist now
until recent years  thats y america is messed up theres still no such thing as womens rights in texas so on and so forth smh
we would like to see all the documents as well the documents from the clinton investigation strock carter page fisa documents etc lets go
poor libs their textbook only consists of 1 crying 2 protests 3 shout muh russia 4 impeach  and then more crying hahaha
liberal feminism is a joke
think he is a wise man
good chat senator grassley
grassley is old as dirt protest is american but old white privileged men telling women to shut up is not there are no mobs just women deserving to be heard
lets investigate nancy pelosi and make them records public
why is it that only the repugnants oops meant republicans are the only ones whoare the heroes no matter what they lie they cheat they steal and they are hypocritical ass clown one and all nov 6th vote all republicans out then impeach and imprison trump and arrest and jail his entire criminal family also impeach kavanaugh and try him as a rapist
roe v wade should be overturned but not by the supreme courtby congress the same is true of many other supreme court rulings  every ruling which changed practices that had been considered constitutional for almost two centuries in our nation to be unconstitutional and vice versathere are only two legitimate ways to change the laws and principles that govern our nation an amendment to the constitution a bill voted into law by congress if the supreme court can change the constitution or a law by a 54 vote the constitution becomes a meaningless document and our legal system has no stabilityif the majority of nine unelected officials have the final uncontestable say on the laws and policies that govern our nation we are not a constitutional republic we are an oligarchythomas jefferson said as muchyou seem to consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions a very dangerous doctrine indeed and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy the constitution has erected no such single tribunal knowing that to whatever hands confided with corruptions of time and party its members would become despots sept 28 1820 letter to william jarvisjames madison also said this was an indefensible practiceas the courts are generally the last in making the decision on laws it results to them by refusing or not refusing to execute a law to stamp it with its final character this makes the judiciary department paramount in fact to the legislature which was never intended and can never be proper oct15 1788we have a government of checks and balances congress limits the power of the executive branch the executive branch limits the power of congress  unfortunately the only thing that limits the power of the judiciary is the courts themselvesuntil this is changed we will have a contentious and divided nationa two thirds majority vote in both houses of congress should enable congress to set aside supreme court decisions this can be done by congress passing a law or by an amendment to the constitution  when one studies the founding of our nation it becomes obvious our founders intended for congress to be the most powerful branch of our government this is because it is the only branch that has all its members elected by the people in a government of by and for the people for congress not to be the most powerful branch is completely illogicalpresently congress is subservient to both the judicial and executive branch and that has brought a lot of problems to our nationthe germ of dissolution of our federal government is in the constitution of the federal judiciary  thomas jefferson
republican women are hot
crusty old blowhard
she is so pretty
its time to move on and get down to business
if the political process is not fixed by the people in office the people will fix it
dims are only helping to unify and strengthen the republican party with their relentless attacks the politicians are responding and the voters are responding theyve poked the hornets nest too many times and that only brings trouble on the one with the stick november will prove this vote republican and get these disgusting dims out of office 
will be the end of the democrat party as they are all perp walked to guantonomo
senator grassley you did a fantastic job  the left no longer is significant  the agenda of the left is unamerican  senator grassley i believe you will encourage further investigations into the credibility of those on the left who were behind this outrageous slanderous spectical  these people  need to be brought to justice  u all are giving blasey ford a pass  why because she is a cia operative and is her entire family  as with obama and the restfree pass free pass senator grassley thank you for courage and standing up to left  this is all apart of the coup against americait is not just against potus  the deep state and budhclinton crime syndicate is still at workamericans are being played for foolssoross machines best be down in florida ohiothe mid westwhere ever patriots save america vote red  nov 6
they cant impeach trump or kavanaugh it takes a 23 majority in the senate to impeach anyone they would never get that
does no one else think that grassley looks like an angry old scarecrow
grassleys the man democrats are as dumb as a post
why the hell should kavanaugh thank the democrats  what a stupid question  would you thank the people who tried to ruin your life
what a feckless cuck he shouldnt have allowed that ridiculous hearing
he thanked the people who voted yes for him why would he thank the people who voted against him
god bless senator grassely
this whole fiasco played out many times before in historyincluding the crucifixion of jesus christ
grassley is so old like really  probably he can only get hard when playing bretts devils triangle
just before every civil war in history an evil wind has consumed the hearts and souls of of people causing them to disregard human life and decency i see that evil wind moving among us now
gotta say mr grassley is a gentleman  and how he held all this together and kept is cool is amazing i could of had a melt down lol x
iowa has a great governor senator grassley represents
another important point to be considered about impeachment a sitting supreme court justicein this case kavanaugh    democrats will have to wait until at least jan 2025 before this can happentrump will be in power and so will the republican congress until that time   and even if a crime could ne connected to kavanaughjust like a sitting president of the united statesits the same impeachment procedure and if by some chance its smooth and goes through quicklymaybe maybe 5 years   so all the republican current supreme court justices including kavanaugh if the democrats wanted them impeachedthe best case scenario for  even the first supreme court justice to be removed at best would be jan 2030and then min 5 years for each one after and thats with all the evidence in place    so its a pipe dream for democrats and meanwhile they all keep losing elections and their numbers are dwindling to zero
2 door ford was not credible i wish you fucks would quit handling her allegations with kid gloves youre worried about the optics of going after a survivor and that is why she will not pay for her crimes
well we impeached a president for lying under oath only lied about one thing but one thing is enoughkavanope lied several times
you got to love kavanaughs when he grins if you look at the corner you see hes got a little sadistic there rub that salt into that open wound lol
my question is when did the democrats decide that their goal was to become nazis their ideology matches up perfectly with adolph hitlers the nazis had no proof of wrong doing by the jews and yet they were persecuted it started with taking their jobs then they destroyed their lives what the democrats did to judge kavanaugh was exactly how the nazis first treated the jews then the nazis spiraled down just as the democrats and their zombie reich are doing
its ok to think differently but this is not the problem with libs they dont think at all they are just being violent and act like nazis cause they want to be in controlmay they never get power
 protect the women   this man is wise       34
love grassley
everyone knows impeaching him isnt legit the job is to slow him down
wow what a sound mind clear and interesting interview  who knew an old white guy could be so decent  maga2020
i dont know who does the close captioning in these videos but they never convey correctly the words spoken  this needs fixing it sucks
dr  hillary ford  seems synonymous
i believe we should hand an indictment document to pelosi for the visa stock fraud she perpetrated years ago
patriots will when
grrrr ass lee  has been there so long he still believes that there is no communist infiltration the only grassroots that exist any longer are the ones from his ass to his chair in the senate
pelosi is right just wrong battle
women should be in the kitchen 
make sure to get out and vote red in november
no because the dems were complete jerks
democratic party is the more lethal isis terrorist group
pelosi wants documents sure right after she hands over all of obamas and hillarys and james comeys and huma abedins documents to us
fetus can feel pain from the time it becomes a fetus and called as fetus
and we the people have to sit back and listen to this crap everyday when we should be going down en masse to washington dc and run everybody out of town
imagine the gnashing of teeth if republicans responded to these threats by initiating investigations into the liberal justices to fish for impeachable offenses
i figured it out we are being tested probably other planets involved and we are running out of time best that we figure  out what to do
kavanaigh thanked joe manchin by name hes a democrat correction needed
i love grassley but hes wrong about ford and the metoo movement all those people do is cause destruction and chaos and false allegations metoo and ford are cancers to the sexual assault awareness movement
why are the leftist so racistthe color of a man skin and his age is all that matters lord help them to stop being so narrow minded maga2020
democrats a disaster
how about putting ford on trial for perjury and a complete investigation into this area
dems acted like bunch of noobs
when did the republican party become a sexual predator protection network
the left will have to hide if they try to impeach the judge or the president were not playing anymore
proud of you grassley morals and integrity all the way
i am embarrassed to have harris and feinstein as my senators
booker is an idiot
powell is not sure the orange clown can be a moral leader really  what gave him the first clue admitting to groping women praising nazis or kidnapping kids
sad that all they doing right now is just trying to find out how to get rid of them all for 2020 but nothing about what they gonna do that they think is gonna be better for the country if there on the seats
there is no such thing as white guilt
what does it say about the people who put booker in office they most are dumber then he is
trump 2020
a must watch patriots american life in 1957here on youtube a reminder of why we must vote out every demon rat socialist loving sharia loving politician 
those millions and millions of votes were counted at least twice because florida law required that to happen then al gore sued for it to happen again and bush still won it was a cycle of democrats trying to recount votes only in democrat controlled counties and they wanted to do that until the vote finally went their way after probably seven times bush had still won thats what the supreme court put a stop to the reason why civility was the norm during the clinton administration is because republicans dont play the same dirty tricks that democrats do
grassley is awesome
killing babies in the womb is not in the purview of man this is gods domain and many people are going to find out gods wrath whether they are alive or dead
23 senate required impeach it wont happen
do you think these demwitleftist and their media are the biggest threat in american history 
senator grassley made a lot of interesting comments in this video ironic that the one about impeachment is the one that was chosen as the title of this video lol
demacrates need to be in prison for enciting civil unrest
grassleywhat a scumbag
with kavanaugh on the supreme court over half of the country doesnt regard the supreme court as a legitimate institution any more
a democrat will never stand up to that line of questioning
bipartisan with democrats means to participate in anarchy there should be no working together with democrats they are against rule of law and common sense
am i the only one imaging grassley and feinstein as the perfect mayor and mrs shinn in the music man  i probably am
the american people like a good put on the wrestlers from the wwe act better that this
you can not impeach a judge  moron
hahahahahahaimpeachment another joke from the left what a pack of useless turds
these dems bad mouth dictators like putin  because he supposedly throws elections to selfserve him hello everything is impeach when they cant get there way  isnt that short of a coup in a free society where the peoples vote counts  why arent they arrested and charged with treason 
sjw vocabularypatriarchywhite male surpremacistimpeachrefugees
bretts slobbering whiny testimony will live on in history as the most embarrassing video ever taken of a supreme court justice thanks grassleylol
excellent job senator grassley howeverif there is an opening and we can ram another conservative throughsorry charleysomeone else can head up the council  i nominate lindsay graham lol my gosh i never thought i would be in support of lindsay graham and mitch mcconnelnor would i have in a million years dreamed i would be liking kanye west over taylor swift oh how the trump train shakes things up maga
grassleys one of those senators that when he speaks its wise to listen
 took longer by three r four weeks now that was unwise justice delayed is justice denied grassley
this is not correct kavanaugh specifically thanked joe manchin for his vote
chuck grassley is old school the best kinda senator he reminds me of the old guy whose wife dies in cucoon the film lol
its not judge kavanaugh anymore  its justice kavanaugh
such a garbage no logical point
i have no hope
we are coming for all you white entitled old rich good old boys clubwomen are coming in november
i wish people would listen to mr grassley with their screen blank and his voice manipulated like a witness in protection then lets take a street poll
real talk
mccallum is such a dumbass this country desperately needs an enemapurge
kavanaugh belongs on the court  people used to think supreme court judges were beyond partisan politics  nobody would dare say that now  show that group of hack lawyers for what they are  kavanaugh is a prick but he fits right in with the rest of them
justice kavanaugh spoke the truth something demslibslefty dont understand congrats to justice kavanaugh
well so thats why dems would not ever win again never
impeach him for what
no need to impeach him he has lawsuits pending primarily for perjury
the dems are upset because we are making the judicial branch republican and blocked the garland for a year we going to take over reproductive rights next so start crying dems
i wanna bust this guy in the face with a baseball bat
so when are we going to see ford go to jail
hell yeah f u dems
they dont have the votes nor near close
now they want to impeach him is that the answer to anyone you dont wanttrump impeach
its was unwise for the craven gop goblins to appoint a judge who can be impeached because he lied throughout the hearings and demonstrated that he lacks the required temperament for the job
what is required to impeach  remove a judge   first the house needs to bring charges by a majority  to remove the senate needs have a 23ds majority  that aint gonna happen  if this continues some people are going to die
democrats hate america and americans  prove me wrong 
declassify the documents
grassley says metoo is good and blaseyford brought credibility and this is a leading republicanwow
vote my republican friends dont let the mid term fall into the hands of the demented democrats please vote too much at stake the job is not finished keep up the good work
of course he should thank the dirty dems and their media pals for trying to crucify him in front of his wife and daughters in a disguting attempt to convince the american public he is a serial gang rapist thanks a bunch you dirty bastards
justices on the scotus can get impeached
trump divides us by calling all democrats obstructionist  he divides us when he supports those who molest women he divides us when he molests women and even admits to it on tv  hes destroying trade in this country  our stock markets have gone down the last year by a lot he has no understanding of his job his staff has to pull papers off his desk to keep him from making a stupid decision he is now giving miranda rights to terrorists hes attacking our fbi and intelligence agencies at every turn for doing their jobs he fires anyone who criticizes him and belittles anyone who criticizes him in general typically on twitter hes dismissed russian interference he wont condemn the altright or even the kkk   he thinks there is such thing as clean coal and denies climate change even though its been proven by hundreds of scientists in the field of weather he makes every single issue about him he thinks john mccain who was captured isnt a hero and prefers those who werent capturedhe engages is corrupt business dealings which he ends up not paying contractors for good work he got in trouble for only selling his apartments to white families and discriminating against those of color even when both families had equal qualifications when is mexico paying for the wall  he lies about the un yes the usa pays the most into the un  but if you look at total gdp other countries pay more than the usa  he dismantled enviormental regulations  messing up the affordable care act but had no replacment system or even changed any laws  has lied more than any president in history  cant hire good staff to save his life all tax breaks for middle class expire but upper classes tax breaks never expire doesnt seem fair puts a travel ban when were a country built on immigrantsmaybe you dont agree with some of these claims and thats probably fair but how can you support him why cant the republican party bring anyone better
great man for the job may god protect and keep him safe
grassley should have never let it get this far
martha macallum would be a better fit at cnn
martha the shill
trump 2020
ford credible  shes as credible as automaker fords edsel
impeach and you will see the devil dogs
apparently colleges are wanting to make that ford woman who accused him some heroiconall the left has are sluts and fakersalso of course women dont want a part of real workthats why stem is failing thats biology for you
im not american but im glad kavanaugh got through not because of politics but because it would set a dangerous example if a baseless alegation from decades ago where not even place or date are know would have cost him the job nobody would have been safe after that and i think the majority realizes that and it will backfire for democrats
300 tell me one thing he should have thanked the democrats for
state propaganda
the bums lost lebowski
vote if you all do one thing vote do not think that we can sit this one out
whats up chuck
well the democrats stick togetherwe cant keep trying to stop the boat from rocking while the dems keep whipping the 
be proud of being americansabsolutely
impeach him for what exactly
this is from a 30 year democrat maga vote out the parasites along with their propaganda machine
you are watching the collapse of the democratic party  they cant stand not having power and are now completely deranged
as he said were all americans thats how i see it we are all americans but the democrats with the identity politics try to separate surrogate us thats the problem we need to reject identity politics is a cancer to society identity politics divide and conquer political correctness silencing of free speech reject these
how do we impeach ass grassley
traitor trump the great divider   this man thrives on americans fighting each other
this is not about roe v wade its about stopping open borders the governor of california has opened the borders to let illegals in to get the power of their vote but the court is saying only the president can set immigration policy so if the dnc keeps control of the courts they can keep the power faucet flowing
there should be a heavy punishment for those women who falsely accuse men women of bitterness have turned womanhood into a nuclear weapon they must face a severe punishment for their actions
now that we have technology that shows that theres a baby that feels pain this might change things well maybe they should have thought that was possible before they slaughtered millions of babies with vacuums and surgical tools into the third trimester they frigging knew they were formed and felt pain
funny how the voice of reason is always on the right always
harris and booker are anti american they are pushing the demacratic playbook to the extreme left their goal is to separate the american people and turn us against the police
if its not abolish temporarily inconvenient parts of the constitution its impeach  and on what grounds i cant wait to hear
the brutal way the republicans have been playing dirty politics should be returned by the democrats to play the same game to level the field  the kavanaugh hearing was not though or fair in anyway the republicans ramrodded the whole process no matter what was found about kavanaugh
keep grassley safe pls give him a security detail
martha is a lovely womanjust sayin
hey if democrats choose to deny science in favor of torturing unborn babies 
trump volger display of power  us rednecks hillbillys love it  trump power 
id say let them the democrats shoot themselves in the foot
as the head is so will the body be as the leaders are  so will the people be
dem o trash are sure afraid  of kavanaough
fox is slipping to the left
resistaunce resistaunce grassley raspy voice and all hit a grand slam with this interview glad your up there grassley
i like grassley i really do butany congressperson that says i have been here over 40 years needs to go home
senator grassley senator collins scared the dems by her intelligent impassioned speech it is hard for the dems to listen to facts and good heavens no evidence does not work for them bernie sanders gave a speech on the new world order i watched it on gop war room he scared the crap out of me with the words that came out of his mouth vote maga
i wish republicans would quit saying that she was credible she lied numerous times she was not credible they should stop being poetically correct
democrats are a lie  their ideology is a lie  the truth is they want a global dictatorship  and the more extreme they get the more americans will stand up to fight back and vote no
not wise but by all means democrats do tell us what you have in mind dont hold back we need to know
why would they bother to seek an impeachment of kavanaugh when they have absolutely zero chance of actually removing him go ahead give it your best shot try to impeach him see what happens it is just becoming too easy to call on the democrats lazy bluffs
the only ones that will be impeached is when we impeach the democrats at the next election
because if you cant feel pain its fine if youre killed
very very very important for every american that loves our country to go out and vote republican this november 2018
impeach drumphf and the kavaperv
kavanaugh thanked the dem senator from west virginia im drawing a blank on his name for some reason i know he voted for kavanaugh but he is a democrat and kavanaugh did specifically thank him by name
why is dems  their comrades so desperate to impeach kavanaugh  they tried to impeach mr trump in the aftermath of election just like this  it seems they are fearful of something that we the public are unware of
only those with a racist bent of mind complain about racism
how in the hell can you impeach fire some one who just started his job these demonicrats have lost the minds time for the fema camps to open up military tribunals guaranteed
democrats todaythey come with fire they come with axes gnawing biting breaking hacking burning destroyers and usurpers curse them
another civil war good grief this is so much drama  when did the civil war start  ive been at work all day these people have way too much time on their hands get a job or somethingjust saying
what does it matter where youre from your nationality and the colour of your skin is the least interesting thing about you
954 whos ff
democrats use impeach to soothe their voters
thank you for your service to our nation sen grassley
pray for kavanaugh and his familykeep them safe
friends we have a serious danger on the horizon the left will escalate the violence no matter the outcome of the midtermif they win they will be emboldened if they lose they will lash out violently the media and the masters have been clear lash out at white people white people are to blame for everything arm yourselves and protect your family your community and our great country
did she call him a gecko
impeach kavanaugh  democrats may not win but that will be a huge stain as the 2nd justice to be impeached
please  somebody shoot that pernicious horrible jackass he poops on everyone
grass roots my ass more like weeds from a foreign shore
justice cavanaugh should get all of them impiched hes the law now day cant make the law
i have never seen such diabolical ruthless vitriolic behavior from the party of tolerance compassion and peace
i want to remind everyone between 1789 and about 2001 there were no filibusters  then schumer gave this famous speechit should becoming increasingly clear how all this chaos and dysfunction that we are witnessing is very very jewish  either in literal form or figurative fashion  over 200 years of procedural goodfaith tradition  trashed  nadler running on impeachment  all this chaos and dysfunction we are witnessing is jewish engineered  the dnc under ideological  and behavioral control of jews is a very ugly thing  their jewish allies in media and academia have promulgated antiwhite bigorty under the phony guise of serious sociopolitical critical analysis  please to go along with it all  this racism is now socially acceptable  you can see itlook at the way they treated bork yes  look at the way they treated thomas yes but then there was a period of time during the 1990s when there seemed to be common sense prevailed  and ginsburg and breyer were approved almost unanimously says grassley  well yeah geeze i wonder whyif jews dont get what they want on a consistent basis they intend to plunge this country into civil war  it should really be coming into a focus for americans and give some of us a new persepetive on history perhaps  its their way or no usa
i am spartacum
gotta to be proud of grassley for his stand in the face of ignorance
he lied to congress lets see how that plays out
there is nothing bipartisan about congress or what the republicans did during this hearing
i only hear white women saying old white mendoes that mean they hate their dads n grandfathers
ever since i lived in iowa when i was still a democrat i always had a lot of respect and admiration for this fair and reasonable man parties aside we need more people like him in government i think
that news anchor is gorgeous
how about we worry about getting the best person for the job and not about what their skin color or gender is  this diversity crap is contributing to the decay of our country
kavanaught would never have taken the job if he knew there was a chance of impeachment empty talk leftist hysteria
you can forget that senator grassley the dems dont care about the constitutionthe law ideology is the only thing they care about and leftist ideology at that
these leftist keep pushing the 2nd will eventually come into play
grassley did great
i dont understand why so many people seem to think that dr ford was credible she seemed to me to be an actor faking and putting on the trembley  voice and acting as though her entire world was turned upside down perhaps she had been the target of sexual abuse by someone but her entire demeanor seemed to me to be put on and false
and they are still digging aroundand they will continue to dig around bc that is what dogs do
i think impeaching brett kavanaugh is big mistake
i think we should impeach the dems  they way they acted was anti american
call this interview grassley on the grassroots
george soros needs to be stopped
get soros minions  out of our political process
fact  for every action is an equal and opposite reaction newtons lawif you want a judge to be sympathetic to your cause dont assassinate his character and try to ruin his lifedont blame kavanaugh for not thanking democrat senatorswhat do these people expect
the dems used roe vs wade as an excuse the truth is that they didnt want a conservative on the court bc its a lifetime appointment and they were desperate to tilt the court left hung their hopes on hillary and when she lost they knew it was over the fate of the court is sealed and that is why they will attempt to impeach kavannaugh
senator grassley you are awesome 
ugh white dudes smh
he perjured himself repeatedly to the senate  he must be impeached
grassley i see your 3 million and raise you 3 milstraight boss
young democrats probably have never given this old guy a chance sure you may differ in some core issues but if you cant sit down and realize youre dealing with a smart sharp older man that you might be able to learn something fromthen youre really just not being honest with yourself and reality
grassley another flaming drama queen coming out from the gop i tough the gop were not tolerant of p v   ies  ooppps sorry  i meant lgtb community 
we will never forget merrick garland democrats should pack the supreme court give statehood to dc split california into 3 progressives giving the senate 9 dem senators
i really dont understand how the demorats get the idea that they can run and posses the usa and the people just because they have their sickos unemployed workers doing a bunch of yelling  do they ever sleep
proud iowan here well done chuck
there should be a new american law that says any unborn human fetus in america has a constitutional right to life
he cant be impeached  the only way they can get him out of office  if he dies or resien if they wanted him not to be a judge is not let him become a judge in the first place  look it up  dems are full of sht
democrat party hollywood and the media are the enemy of freedom and america
dems are not capable of wisdom so yeah if its not wise theyll be there with bells on
hes a fair good man
720 he really made his feelings known good man
excellent interview
ive seen this before 1920s  1930shitlers brown shirts and italys mussolinis black shirts anti fascist my ass its straight out of its play book
the living dead old man should have been forced into retirement long ago
for 85 years old he is amazing god bless him
kavannaugh should only thank the dems who voted to confirm him the rest heck no
not wise
saying dr ford brought credulity is disingenuous
it was unwise to ram through kavanaughs confirmation  mr grassley   your obstruction of merrick garland and power grab with kavanaugh is the extreme partisanship that is gridlocking the country  republicans are still butthurt that obama won two elections and have refused to compromise for 10 straight years
listen demoncrats we the people are done putting up with your sht walk lightly liberals youre in dangerous territory
the dems are like children spoiled children but worse their behavior is beyond the pale they are like ravening wolves seeking whom they may devour we must keep both houses and stop them cold they will keep this up why bc that is the way crazy works crazy is as crazy does
why grassley keeps calling her as dr ford and credible first she is not licensed in california and she is just a professor second she was not credible she didnt remember anything so how can she be credible what she did was to babytalk look stupid and suffering for nothing
i cant stand democrats  their thought processes are so alien
dr ford and the me too movement brought credibility ohh manoh well fauxnews and these spinelessrepublicansthere can be no dialogue with these communists none
ford is not credible do not get fooled
grassly not wise
harris and booker have no classthey are just ghetto ratsnothing more
grassley is weak make abortion illegal
grassley was weak and nearly mucked up the whole thing the ford allegations were preposterous in the first place and should never have been entertained but grassley allowed it  only by the grace of god were the dems unsuccessful in derailing kavanaugh grassley is way too old to be where he is
2001  when the usa was attacked by the alliey  israel 911 truth will drain the swamp
yes its called civil war 2
1981wtf retire mutherfukrfukn leaches i swearterm limits needed badly for these old hags

fox us garbage
feinstein wants 7th fbi investigation sealedhow can you impeach when theres something in fbi report they want hidden
the ones who needs to be impeached are frankenstein booger  hiroshima and the other perps

democrats cry fool they will never do anything which they wish
the greatest pathological liar the likes the world has ever seen
nothing was revealed you idiot they were all lies
speaking to reporters no wait make sure you tell her the rules 
im not sure i understand why grassly thinks shumer poisoned the well but its ok for him to choose to not vote on a nominee that seems hypocritical
can you be proud to be white sen grassley
when does the uncivil war begin
alot ov gerrys need to be sodomized
democrats should just declare civil war as they did when they fought to keep the black man enslaved only the next time republicans need to wipe every last one of them off the face of this country
you knew i was a snake b4 u took me indjtpuppet of the wealthy special interest and lobbyistswe have tons of money wait 4 it pouring i from russiaeric trumppuppet of putin
i love when ben shapiro called cory booker mr potato head when he bulges his eyes out he looks just like him
what i find funny is they say roe vs wade is settled law because its been that way for 50 year or so but those same people say we need to over turn 2nd amendment witch has been settled law way longer than roe vs wade that rule cant apply to just one it has to apply to them all
dump trump   vote blue this november  save our country

vote blue in november    vote out hate
vote out pathetic redudlicans
the mob must be stopped vote red
ford was not credible she is insulting and demeaning to real assault victims i would love to see her investigated
the dems wont have anyone left in november to even attempt an impeached on kavanaugh  these liberals have hurt themselves with this mess everyone i know personally who were democrats have switched to the republican party  theres a red wave coming in nov
it wouldnt be no abortion issue if people took responsibility and made sure they dont get pregnant when they dont want to get pregnant
most courrupt administartion in us political history makes nixon and w look like choir boysscandal after scandal investigation after investigation thank god for bob mueller holding these crooks accountable
ford was not credible
yes  its very odd judge kavanaugh didnt thank the democrats during his swearing in ceremony they reached out to him  with a noose in their hands    maybe hes planning on reaching out when their lunatic court cases come before him
americans firstyes
i remember justice kavanaugh saying and thank you to all senators who carefully considered my appointment
rid the filth and drain the swamp in november blue tidal wave
collins what a amazing women you for staying up for whats right ty
stupid question you asked was kavanaugh supposed to thank the people that smeared him
prn world
thankd god for the deep state exposing the lies from the right the party that claimed they were the party of jobs and families has been a ruse dems have created 2x the  of jobs in 8 less years going back 5 decades miniumum wage should be 23 hourto adjust for inflation the gop has suppressed ur wages for more then two decades while enriching themselves and their wealthy friends  rid the filth
dr ford did not bring credibility just the opposite she brought bs what a maroon
i dont believe a word christine ford said
grassley is a good example of why term limits should be imposedand im conservative but he is out of touch as well
grassley did great
at the end he said and thank all of the senators  who evaluated him so he included everybody just didnt  name the democrats by name
fake feminist yes and now he will raise money to disprove that he will support the women that supports men
christine ford just walks away scot free enjoying soros money in the tropical islands cringe 
im not american and i consider myself a liberalist  theres a lot about american republican politics i dont like but im pretty pissed at the democrats for attacking collins   western societies must not treat accusations as fact   and the ends do not justify the means
i love that he stays neutral you are a great soul
impeach kavanaugh for what passing 8 fbi background checks including the ford democrat scam why not impeach someone who deserves it like waters and or every other lying cheating scamming democrat  pos out there
me no likey me wanna impeach you 
is it martha  please martha she did not have a seminal experience speech or whatever in any case why did you did not say an ovarian experience as  remember semen comes from males
the gop puppets gerrymandered districts to cheat the electoral college voted to take health care away from people with preexisting conditions children with cancer diabetics seniors veterans the poor and middle classthey want to take u back to the days of the flinddtones where u pay outrageous amounts of money and have no coverage so the comapanies reap the benefits and keep them in dc
so professionally done chairman grassley thank you sir blessings to you and yours grateful patriot
its ok to be conservative
grassley abuses children that makes whatever he has to say irrelevant and worthless kavanaugh committed perjury and should be held legally accountable and be put in jail where any other red blooded america would be
paid soros lesbo democrat protesters
the dizzy dems never learn now they want to impeach everyone but the local dog catchera sure sign of desperation
hispano para trump
admiralty fringe on the flag right over grassleys right shoulder
martha mccallum what the hell would justice kavanaugh be thanking the democrats for
ford her attorneys and the democrats have set the womens movement back 50 years her own 3 witnesses said that she was lieing
crazy to see how much damage just one or a couple of democratic senators can do to the whole process schumer feinstein pelosi hell the list is long
you think it bad now just try it the day that happens will bring catastrophic results the demonrats will need more than throwing rocks and water bottles
it takes a twothirds supermajority for the senate to remove im sorry democrats but that aint happening in this lifetime
gop puppets to the wealthy keep voting for them and keep handing ur paycheck over to them  theyve taken ur health care suppressed ur wages suppressed ur voting rights attacked womens rights attacked internet rights put 1000s of taxes on us citizens thru tariffs cars soaring 2k6k food prices soaring gas prices soaring obama had gas at 150  vote them out
fake news keeps mentioning the protesters like the whole building was surrounded for as far as the eyes could see  it was about 2030 snowflakes in the door way in reality they caused about as much trouble as a 3rd grade class on a field trip
dont aid feminists  at the very core feminists are evil  and evil always eat their own
corey booker is an admitted sexual assault predator why isnt he in prison
before the dems seek impeachment of kavanaugh i believe the american tax people have the right to see how many of the sitting senators have used the tax payer funded slush fund thats used to pay off sexual harassment victims they should think twice about this
chuck grassley made me laugh when he told cory spartacus booker how many times you going to say the same thing that he said he broke the senate rules chuck grassley said okay how much time do you need
only came here to say disbar
oh hell the metoo movement is just a bunch of pms women in george soros pocketbook
too much diversity in america and they want to change the constitution thanks to obama dividing the america people now they are attacking the old white men doesnt matter if old or young your are still white it is racist
they keep saying ford was credible  why  she lied about fear of flying  her so called witnesses said they didnt know anything among other things  thats not credible
this man is a true american to those of you on the left try to wrap your head around that
real men
the impeachment demonuts wants it never will take place why bec american people are tired of same bs over and over from leftis theirs hatefulness tactis against trump didnt worked now same want do kavanaugh red waves coming on midterms and on 2020
all these hate filled left wing liberals are welcome to start a country dividing war knives at a gunfight
hold the phone did she just say that kavanaugh only thanked the republicans as if that was a bad thing listen here lady the only thing those democrats deserve is a middle finger for obstruction of justice not to mention the orchistrated coup detat of not only brett but also the president no he dose not have to thank or recognize any democrats in that matter
cory crooker stfu crybaby 
ginsberg needs to be retired or impeached never kavanaugh
smart man
grassley avennery has a reputation in the porn world love that coot
usa loves grassley
booker and harris do we really want spartacus and a proven whore running america hell no
demonrat vision is always  die vision 
thank you democrats for calling me a serial rapist alcoholic and evil ice thrower yeah thatll happen
senator collins gave a historical well thought fantastic speech she needs to be applauded for it
god bless grassely
be smartdont be like stupid peoplevote r 
this is a real onorabla men
ah hahaha the me too movement is opening the can of rotten worms that the clintons never expectednow the me too movement will be the initiative to go after the washington pizzagate conspirators hallelujah
nobody is going to impeach justice the democrats arent planning for that its just a trump selffabricated story an invented framework on which to trample the democrats more
first of allthere is nothing to impeach him onsecondthey dont have the balls to try
when standards are tried and decorum strained those who hold too shine and you sir have shone
plus its not possible
mr grassley  thank you for your loyalty thank you dont retire
he shouldn t be on the supreme court he is a liar he lied under oath disgraceful  perjurer and felon
thank you chairman grassley you are one tough cookie and i am not even an american but canadian  brought up in the us from 4 to 13 years old  i thank you so very much for all that you have done to get kavanaugh through bravo to you
got my voting papers in the mail today cant wait to vote republican get these demonrats out of office
when are these dinosaurs gonna retire
eh hem eh hem clear your fvking throat liar
cant wait till some of these dem politicians are prosecuted all they care about is keeping their abortions their weed and their free handouts
ford allegation was a hoax fbi report delves into that and demonrats are not going to win unless mass illegal voting
im happy to be hispanic but i thank jesus christ im americanhispanics for trump 
fords leftist deep state handler monica mclean needs to be investigated
the left is not known for doing anything wise
the american citizens are united and strong in restoring our great nation vote red
grassley is a class act
they love the word impeach lol get over it dems yall lost and instead of trying to make things better yall went apeshit nuts and hopefully will never be put in office again
impeach him for lies
not sure why fox keeps calling these freaks protestors not unhinged rioters
grassly unless you investigate demoncraps and the whole cabal that worked with ford this is what we have to endure it is your fault that you dont have the spine to open investigations ars kissing does not work
the globalistno borders crowd are not grass rootsthey are totalitarians and operate from the top down
which is exactly what is  missing in the entire democrat party wisdom is lessons learned and it just does not happen
dont feed the trolls  dont respond to their stupidity  why are they even here on foxnews except to troll  simply dont respond  troll  tds soros paid trollsofn69583 highburyafcsoul rose goldcb john bongiovipoetic aphorism timothy ryan  master ouya crazy clown  proud californian chris smith  im all out of bubble gum acab 2 chainzmichelle stephensanne bennett hillary clinton mr kim is america great againthe memovyr more frank king hillary clinton  emancipated hostdonny ponykakaroto  patrick gilmore maetiberius jodie holmeskeyboyrecordslawrence torres john winslowsun sean hong ursula moon p chan oscar montgame freak9 cuekwe jones dizolvoctavio rodriguez christopher hamill bytor 1001elvin ostrupchristine diaz sheila boydroshan tapa love of carnage brad shores trollpiefillingricky jordan money colorsheik yoyo boyrc ur butthurtdexter johnston rethinking religion sigmund freud escape from  music quote the raven all infected with tds and soros paid trolls  dont feed the trolls
what do the dems even do besides whining
ford bought credibility to the hearing
the constitution indicates that impeachment requires a majority vote but conviction requires a super majority vote kavanaugh can only be removed by conviction and i doubt that a super majority will ever make that happen even if the leftist take control
shockingdems crying  reminds me of 2016  same reactions
the party on the left has had one goal in mind and that was to over throw america and its constitutioni pray those that were key players in washington will be prosecuted
well i have to give it to democrats  even when these three allegations fell apart they rode that ship right on down when they spent half the day going over a scotus nominees high school yearbook then i thought they had hit rock bottom  apparently they got out the excavator  will they impeach him over these three ridiculous allegations or will the ice throwing incident be the key  have they found some disturbing finger paintings he did in kindergarten
you have to have 23 of the house and that will never happen
well i didnt necessarily like the judge but now he is on the supreme court and i see no need to continue this battle it was fought and like all battle a side won leave it alone now
i like him
mr grassley seems like a very intelligent man i bet he is fun to be around after a couple eggnogs during christmas vacation thank you for keeping this circus in check senator grassley ringmaster of the senate judiciary committee
good guy rightfully called out schumer rightfully pointed out that rs will vote for a ginsburg but not vice versa
whoops almost forgot and nor should anyone ever have to apologize for what gender they were born as man or woman give me a break
lets just impeach everyone the left doesnt like i hope and pray people grow up
hes a good man
go fund me should not he allowed to fund political agendas if caught doing so the money should be confiscated and those asking for the money should be jailed
and after that no one should ever have to apologize for their age either how ridiculous how racist and how prejudiced
the period of common sense prevailing in the 1990s when almost unanimous appointments were ginsberg and breyer both democratic appointments this means the republicans were the opposition party at no time since bork have the democrats allowed for appointments without making a circus thats the 1980s
dummycrats will do anything including harassing  people to get what they want most of these people who are protesting in the streets are a bunch of losers
no one in this country should ever have to apologize for what color they were born as white black brown whatever we are all americans and we were born the color we were born how horrible to think that anyone would condemn anyone for their color i dont even know what to say its such a horrible thought
vote these reichwingers out their uneducated hillbilly supporters are holding the country back

i have to admit i was neither for or against senator grassley although i am a conservative  after this interview i am totally onboard with senator grassley  a great interview and hopefully more people than myself learned a lot about senator grassley
about as likely a chance as that of swetnicks saga being true besides they dont have the votes
wise to impeach all you old farts
the dems cant impeach him it would take 23 of the senate to impeach kavanaugh thats 66 senators of the 100 never going to happen
attention the red wave has been upgraded to a red tsunami go out and vote for the betterment of humanity vote out violent leftist criminals
maga  republicans get on board  or get  off at the first stop
dems want to detroy the us the dems are trash
that very room is also in a recent movie btw
these corrupt folks need to stop they are going to pay heavily come november
grassley has 20 years on me and he is so much more open minded  seems like a stand up guy
has anybody accused the democrats in recent centuries of being wise
shhhh chuck let em spend political capital on foolishness
democrats please go home
see they can not corrupt him buy him out so they are pissed hahahhahahah he needs to get them in his court room hahahahahah
too bad donald dogturd and this entire communist crooked enterprise will be over in 29 days
he thanked manchin as well
kavanaugh isnt a member of the deep statethats why they tried to smear him
keep it up democratsthis is how nixon won two terms
fux state propaganda network is a steady stream of bullshit 247
67 votes for impeachment haha good luck
please democrats threaten to impeach kavanaugh thank you for giving us on the right something to rally behind we couldnt have done it without you
949   nobodyfffffffff      now i see why kavanaugh and his buddies came up with that line 
screw you grassley cuckservatard pos
that avenatti should be disbar he is a shame for the bar association
me i wonder if she is as attractive as i imagine her to be
good ol chuck may stumble over his words at times or seemingly find himself thrown off by completely predictable interruptions but gollygee he sure hung on with all he had left to achieve kavanaughs confirmation thank the lord above for this mans follow through good job grassley
grassley says its not wise but hes talking about the liberal democrats the democrats in general they never do anything thats wise i really like senator grassley
do not entertain lunatic dems threats theyre empty
democrats
how did this country bumpkin end up with so much power i hate these old crackers
believe all women until you do not agree with them collins is real woman
okso get rid of grassley before 2020
the socialist dems are so desperate they cant even see what they are doing still coming against justice kavanaugh now is going to hurt them more and more each week in the eyes of the american voters their thirst for corruption is so strong now they arent even thinking straight the proof of the pudding will come in the midterms
can we impeach this old useless fool
bullshit fucker has to go
it was not wise for grassley to block merrick garland to the supreme court screw what grassley thinks democrats can get rid of brett kavanaugh if they win in november
rich old white men should be turned into dog food

god bless the republicans
this has shown me just how messed up the left are i hope many many eyes in this country have seen this also and want to vote all red
lol i clicked on this video because it said 777 views but when i got in here the viewership was 1820
at first i wasnt even that keen on kavanaugh becoming a justice i have a problem with him helping write up as well as his stance on the patriot act but how he was smeared and how the left behaved forced my hand and i was very impressed with his testimony go ahead and try to impeach first of all youll need a majority and thats extremely unlikely and second youll have to have proof of wrongdoing or loss of mental capacity and that is even more unlikely
the jackals are restless again theyre bunch of sour grapes
republicans stop playing by the bigoted left playbook having women on the committee doesnt mean anything you need to have fair impartial people on the committees
they dont even have bases for impeachment they just talk to fire up their voters that only get motivated by hatred and disturbance
not wise coming from this old fart
i liked beer i still like beer
impeach for what these people are foaming at the mouth rabid psychos
if the democrats take the house we can count on kavanaugh and trump being impeached there will be long boring hearingslong boring antitrump and antikavanaugh diatribes in other wordsnothing will get donenone of americas business will be worked it will be one loooong witch hunt against both men to work up as much antitrump feelingin the minds of as many american voters as possible so the democrats can win the 2020 presidential election of course removing either of these two men is just about impossible since it would take 23rds of the senate to remove them from office something that has very little probability so in other words it will be another long waste of time that will cheat the american people by letting these high paid democrat politicians primp pose and expoundand not do any real work
when i was five i got a doctor kit for christmas thats all im sayin
hmmm another dem bs tactic
hurt feelings does not equal an impeachment amazing how people still dont understand that
we drank beer still like beer still drink beer
grassley stood strong so did graham lets not forget kavanaugh and president trump we are winning not tired of it yet
that is what got jesus killed the republican jews denied him but he was a real judge now fvk with that
senator grassley thats not even visible unless mobbs will commit more fraud in election  and most importantly mobbs  are the ones to be impeached on fraudfalse accusations and other criminal acts committed while manufacturing  executingperpetrating this scam  criminal mobbs want lawlessness sign me up as 1 for hunting season
show people these fools they are dangerous as any other radical group
the dems are just 2year olds having a sht fit because they didnt get there way its time to start putting them in jail for crimes against the people of the usa
dems are trying anything to enrage the dem base but impeachment will never happen
red tsunami and blue  teardrops falling demonic rats need their own country the sooner the better
looser left looser libtards
the judiciary committee doesnt provide much opportunity to its members in the way of constituent service its members cant exactly bring home the pork from working on the judiciary committee and then there is the downside such as we see in the kavanaugh hearing
the people qualifies you to be a judge dummy
grassley buddy there was the appearance of common sense on the courts in the 90s because clinton was president for 8 of those years the dems grinning like cats with cream because clinton would make the picks
mr president let the nation support you one more time  talk about medicare immigration sanctuaries states more jobs  subsides for the farmers manufactures  tell fox to stay out justice cavanaugh because is not helping for the november election  to stop talking about impeach justice cavanaugh all the senators go and campaign now  the president needs your help now mr president america and american people are first above all and stay together
vote republican onnovember 6th
the demonrats are the party of chimney puncherssoyboysdumb sluts and unevolved primates
democrat thugs driving us closer to civil war every day
qualification does not make you a judge  the people do mr einstein
i respect sengrassley but how can he say ford brought credibility to this anybody with a bit of common sense could plainly see that she and her lawyers were perpetrating a complete fraud i think this was so ridiculous to the point that they are daring you to call them out so they can throw a tizzy and call anyone that doesnt tow the line vile mean namescheck her back ground and id bet the farm that this would prove to be a conspiracy
we all know the motto of the intelligence shown by far left liberals and thats let the door hit you on the way out
dr ford brought no credibility nothing absolutely nothing she said could be corroborated
trump won againyall lost again
kavanaugh is a good man so let it be god bless america
senator grassleya senator with principlesnot many of those left in the senate

trumpsterdumpsters and faux news fans you got to stop marrying your first cousins it may be legal in your state but its not good for your gene pool as evident in your low iq comments and thoughts
believe all wahmen unless they have opposing views then they become race traitors
its illegal to impeach him he has done nothing wrong yet
for the love of pete why in the hell should kavanaugh thank the democrats martha the democrats who tried to ruin his life fyi martha he did thank joe manchin a democrat
the dems cant impeach kavenaugh you cant impeach anyone for something that happened before they got the job he didnt do anything anyway he would have to be impeached for something he did as an associate justice of the supreme court he just started and hasnt done anything as a justice what would they impeach him on i cant believe how ignorant democrat lawmakers are of our system of government they are clueless regarding the constitution they are too stupid to be in our government come on people vote them out
unless the democrats have over 67 seats in the us senate then they will never impeachthey are just undergoing a phenomenon called bargaining its part of the stages of grief
the vile lying corrupt democrats arent fooling anybodyyouve lost everything democrats get used to it its only just begunmaga
do the republicans have their faults sure we all do but i must say our side has a very good moral compass
the left seems to want to destabilize everything
dems do not work for america they work for the soros nwo agenda  they are evil haters there to divide create problems create activist groups as pussycat girls like ford antifa kkk isis blm ect november will be a woi for the trump team ans an exorcism for america
ford is not credible
grasshopper grassley  turtle mitch mcconnells age combined is almost 180 years old get rid of these old farts  creepy kavanaugh too
demonrats have become the party of impeachment lol
i think its time to euthanize the trump trash  they no longer contribute to society
we should impeach kavanaugh
what happened to the lying ford womanshe done took that million dollar go fund me pay off and went into hiding the entire thing was a total smear on a good man because he will protect the constitutional rule of law
grassley not wise
i cant get tired of all this winning 
why should kavanaugh thank the dems for anything 99 of them tried to f him over
i wont be suprise if he was cracking
maybe term limits for congress no one person should spend 10 years in congress  none of our elected parasites are going to support  term limits  how else can we make term limits  on congress house or senate   no one should make a 30 year career in  congress 10 years and out
flinging poop at kavanaugh just gonna make more of a red landslide this november
