Which makes me wonder why they care nothing about the long game.  And the logical answer seems to be:  Because we're in their end-game, and the long game is irrelevant.  I really do believe that this is the last stand for freedom.  Vote for these people, and Due Process won't be the only right you lose.  Allow them to continue using schools as indoctrination centers, and you will be handing your nation away in the next generation.  But allow them to dissolve due process, and you will discover friends going missing under their next term.",

I do not deny that Europeans, after having discovered America, they needed people to work in the fields. Perhaps it was at that time that the white man started catching Africans to sell them in America.\nWhile the White man did many wrongdoings, it was the White man that developed Science. The best example is Sir Issac Newton. He had no slaves, he was dedicated to mathematics and natural philosophy (know as physics today). Laplace, the French mathematician, James Clerk Maxwell, the Scottish mathematical Physicist, Carl Friedrich Gauss, the German physicist and many others who lived during the time when the slave trade was legal, yet they didn't have slaves. Their contribution to human knowledge cannot be overstated. ALL WERE WHITE MEN.\nMaybe many of those who will read this comment know that there are slaves, today, in some Arab Countries.",

    "commentText": "Roe v Wade should be overturned but not by the Supreme Court--by congress. The same is true of many other Supreme Court rulings.  Every ruling which changed practices that had been considered constitutional for almost two centuries in our nation to be unconstitutional and vice versa.\nThere are only two legitimate ways to change the laws and principles that govern our nation. An amendment to the Constitution: A bill voted into law by congress. If the Supreme Court can change the Constitution or a law by a 5-4 vote, the Constitution becomes a meaningless document and our legal system has no stability.\nIf the majority of nine unelected officials have the final uncontestable say on the laws and policies that govern our nation, we are not a constitutional republic, we are an oligarchy.\n\nThomas Jefferson said as much.\n\"You seem to consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions; a very dangerous doctrine indeed and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy. The Constitution has erected no such single tribunal knowing that to whatever hands confided, with corruptions of time and party, its members would become despots.\" Sept 28, 1820 letter to William Jarvis.\n\nJames Madison also said this was an indefensible practice.\n\"As the courts are generally the last in making the decision [on laws] it results to them, by refusing or not refusing to execute a law, to stamp it with its final character. This makes the Judiciary department paramount in fact to the Legislature WHICH WAS NEVER INTENDED AND CAN NEVER BE PROPER.\" Oct15, 1788\nWe have a government of checks and balances. Congress limits the power of the executive branch, the executive branch limits the power of congress.  Unfortunately the only thing that limits the power of the Judiciary is the courts themselves.\nUntil this is changed we will have a contentious and divided nation.\nA two thirds majority vote in both houses of congress should enable congress to set aside Supreme Court decisions. This can be done by congress passing a law or by an amendment to the Constitution.  When one studies the founding of our nation it becomes obvious our founders intended for congress to be the most powerful branch of our government. This is because it is the only branch that has all its members elected by the people. In a government of, by and for the people, for congress not to be the most powerful branch is completely illogical.\nPresently congress is subservient to both the judicial and executive branch and that has brought a lot of problems to our nation.\n\n\"The germ of dissolution of our federal government is in the constitution of the federal judiciary.\"  Thomas Jefferson.",

He's destroying trade in this country.  Our stock markets have gone down the last year by a lot. He has no understanding of his job, his staff has to pull papers off his desk to keep him from making a stupid decision. \n\nHe is now giving Miranda rights to terrorists. He's attacking our FBI and intelligence agencies at every turn for doing their jobs. He fires anyone who criticizes him and belittles anyone who criticizes him in general (typically on twitter). He's dismissed Russian interference. He won't condemn the Alt-right or even the KKK.   He thinks there is such thing as \"Clean Coal\" and denies climate change even though it's been proven by hundreds of scientists in the field of weather. He makes every single issue about him, he thinks John McCain who was captured isn't a hero and prefers those who weren't' captured\n\nHe engages is corrupt business dealings which he ends up not paying contractors for good work. He got in trouble for only selling his apartments to white families and discriminating against those of color even when both families had equal qualifications. When is Mexico paying for the wall?  He lies about the UN, yes the USA pays the most into the UN  BUT if you look at total GDP other countries pay more than the USA.  He dismantled enviormental regulations.  Messing up the affordable care act but had no replacment system or even changed any laws.  Has lied more than any president in history.  Can't hire good staff to save his life. All tax breaks for middle class expire but upper classes tax breaks never expire (doesn't seem fair). Puts a travel ban when we're a country built on immigrants.\n\nMaybe you don't agree with some of these claims and that's probably fair, but how can you support him? Why can't the republican party bring anyone better?",
