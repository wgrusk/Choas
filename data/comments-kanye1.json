There is one thing the left can't mentally cope with, as Judge Clarence Thomas pointed out, is an upperty black. But more and more critical-thinking blacks are daring to step outside of the Democrat Plantation and vote Republican. The GOP is already blessed with some very smart blacks, like Candace Owens, Kanye, Stacy Dash, Diamond and Silk and lots, lots more. This is driving the leftists crazy.",

So Lets all simply take charge of whats wrong and fix it as we go along. Theres Good people in this world, that will help us along with this task, and it shows when something good prevails when were all trying to do the right thing towards others. So each time we do something, think before you do it and ask yourself, How will this effect everyone else before I do it!",

Just cause it happens while you are in the whitehouse doesn't mean you are 100% responsible, economic indicators lag. Wall Street just took a tumble, is that all Trump's fault?\nWhile Trump is manipulating a self confessed sufferer of mental health issues, many of his people were walking through the carnage of their lives after a hurricane - where was he? Couldn't be bothered to go throw paper towels or make crass boat jokes. And today? Most likely on the golf course, courtesy of the tax payer, or scoffing cheeseburgers and getting in his daily 6 hours of television, or is he back on holiday - AGAIN? Zero work ethic!\nOnly in the Presence of someone as dopey as Trump can Kanye sound smart. His language has demeaned the Oval Office as much as Trump's presence demeans it.",

He needs to do it every day for atleast 5 years, he needs to block schedule.   I think if your where going to meet with a rapper, 50 cents, is probbly the smartest person ive seen talk, in the genre,   but i cant say i agree with all his tactics,  i think i could flip him, in meeting, a conversation, put him on the happy train for america.  50 cent.     I think kanye, i would have to say, buddy, im going to give you a go cart and a beer,we can talk while your driving it,  thats how i feel about kanye's(west)  idea's , conversations, skills, plans,abilities, know how and intellect.\n\ni think kanye probably a good dude,  celebrity syndrome.    It like how do you learn everything if you have everbody telling your right all the time.  So what happends is, you get in front of america,  and where like dude slow down.   i think go cart engine best sums it up,    Kanye lost me when said \"levi's\"  and jeans.    I listened when he said Atlanta, Home, and Georgia,  A state in A america.  TGB the way i mean it\n\n( where the plan Kanye?   hows it going to be all American)",

Democrats are dividing to conquer.  \"Old white men\" and \"Uncle Tom\" shouldnt be the base of an argument or discussion. It serves to divide. You have to see that! Defend and conquer instead. Defend your congressmen and Senators and let them know what you want. They are being trampled and shot at and followed around getting screamed at. If The crazy Left can stick together, why cant we???",

Oh wait, we have tape!

Although the language isn't becoming, and I find it unnecessary, I don't see how it's so inappropriate because of the Oval Office. The Oval Office has been denigrated by past scumbag behavior and the filthiest talk anyone can imagine. It's not in and of itself a holy sanctum where no one has ever cussed or acted in disgusting manners. I've heard much worse recordings by Lyndon Johnson, Nixon, so many historical accounts of filthy language and unmentionable infidelities occurred in that room. Kanye probably took it up a few notches compared to Clinton's, Obamas. \n\nIt's supposed to be a government of, for, by the people, last I knew, and though I may disagree or not listen to Kanye's music, nor care about football, Jim Brown, Kanye, other Americans have the same right to express their views, visit the WH as long as they are  respectful to our commander in chief, respectful of the property, not there to harm anyone. \n\nThe socialist/globalist corporately manipulated lying propagandizing press however, is so out of hand, they are the biggest offensive guests being given that privilege. I find it very offensive and damaging to our country, our President and the office in general, when I have to watch the horrible behavior and language, non-stop nasty vitriolic and angry unprofessional leftists attacking our POTUS, his supporters and by extension, our Constitution, the Office, Country, every single day. The lack of civility and intelligent, sane discourse, by the media is incredible! I think there should be greater accountability and standards for those who work there, are daily guests like the press corps, and they should be talking about how crazy they all act, work on themselves before criticizing Trump or Kanye, Sarah Sanders, or anyone else.",

But, Kanye can't go to the White House and actually talk about relevant issues with Trump. He gets called an attention whore, and accused of doing it as a publicity stunt. The only reason they are vilifying him, is because he supports a President they don't like. If Obama was still President, or if any other Republican was President, liberals would be praising Kanye for his bravery, and how he is a shining example for all liberals. Liberals are at the point where they dont even try to hide their hypocrisy and double standards! I dont even know why we bother with them anymore. You can't reason with them, you can't have a civilized conversation with them. All they do is attack and insult. Those are the only 2 things in their toolbox. They either attack you, or they insult you, or they do both! Republicans, at this point, need to just ignore them. They thrive on chaos. Ignore them long enough, and maybe they will go away.

WE have been fragmented, weakened, and made to feel felt out and like victims. WE only have THIS moment to wake up and make life better for our self and for others. HE SEES what we have been doing to ourselves for a long long time. Here he has the President of the United States of America across the table - LISTENING to him.

President Trump brought up the positive vibe in the office, that's what the Democrats don't want, because they thrive on negativity, hence the resistance.

    "commentText": "I love how \"Donald Trump is a racist\" is simply accepted because it's a trendy presupposition that is immune to questioning and needs not be supported in fact.  The two common pillars to support that statement are both seriously flawed.\n\n1. \"Trump hates immigrants, therefore he's racist.\"  First of all, stay in school, prejudice of race is not the same thing as prejudice of nationality.  Second, the problem with illegal immigration is not the \"immigration\" part, which is probably why there are 350 million LEGAL crossings of the Mexican border per year, it's the \"illegal\" part.  A controlled border is not a closed border.  When you are the head of the Executive branch of federal government, enforcing federal law is kind of your job.  If you have a problem with what the law is, talk to Congress, they're the ones who write it.  That's what we elect them for, that's what they're paid for.  In the meantime, you could do something crazy, like abide by the law and immigrate legally, then you get to live here without looking over your shoulder.\n2. \"Trump speaks to workers, workers are primarily white, therefore Trump is a white supremacist.\"  When you are literally telling the world that a minority of non-white workers do not matter, you don't get to lecture other people about the evils of marginalizing and ignoring racial minorities, because that's exactly what you are already doing.",

That's  a lie from the democrats.  Trump started up the FIRST African American country club and he has employed and helped plenty of African Americans.  Juan is so wrong and blinded by his hatred that I really can't stand to listen to his silly arguments.  He needs to spend some time with the Democrat who wrote the case against impeaching trump.\nHe might get some wisdom and fair mindedness.",

They are the ones doing their best to divide folks on party lines...Instead of bringing folks together...Dr. King told the World \"I have a Dream\"...That Dream came True!

Like \"The Red Elephants\" channel, \"Know More News\", \"Poseidon\", etc. Much more information/knowledge from these people than Kanye. Rich people are not feeling the crush of the leftist policies like us regular blue collar American citizens. 😏",

Black unemployment is down to a historical low and working class black folks are waking up and really starting to understand and will now back Trump! The left is scrambling to come up with any lie or just anything to derail Trump's popularity with black voters but black voters see that Trump is a man of his word and this is why you will see the difference in 2020 when Trump is reelected because he will receive a hell of a lot more of the black vote!!!!",

I don't agree with all of them, but I have never subscribed to the \"just shut up and dance/sing/act\" line of thought that seeks to forbid artists from sharing their opinions.  In fact, I can think of a few times Greg Gutfeld didn't like celebrity endorsements (although that was when they were left-leaning celebrities).  Now lefties don't like Kanye because he'd leaning right.  They are hypocrites, but so are those on the right who denounce left-leaning celebrities while now embracing Kanye West.\n\nBut...that's who we are.  All humans are hypocrites sometimes.",

But the reality of things are that America went from being a nation of hope to a war machine that cant stop nor fund its own infrastructure because power hungry people care more about wars. As leaders here in America keep attacking Russia, China and anyone else while its obvious our infrastructure is falling apart and the citizens and politicians are divided. A house divided is meant to fall, if Putin is smart all he have to do is relax and watch America fall on it's chaos. As nature ravages America and leaves us more vulnerable and weak all China and Russia have to do is weight, after a coming big quake and some insane hurricanes then they can come sweep the nation without any resistant. America who was the police of the world soon will need others to police it and because Americans are too busy fighting they won't see it coming 👉🎭",

I wish the 10 Commandments were back in our society and schools. Now, everything is \"relative\" to what you \"think or FEEL\" is right or wrong vs. what somebody else thinks or FEELS is right or wrong. Now, if it \"feels good\" do it! So the left, has no problems \"pandering\" to people with \"free\" this, and \"free\" that. That's because it's not their money!! Just like a \"child\" does with their parents money. Where are the adults on the left? They don't even denounce their bad behavior etc. In fact now, they are promoting it! Kanye in his weirdness, still has more going for him then most of them. They've got to hate that. The left \"eat their own\" no matter what the color of their skin.",
