Johnson was the most racist President that we have ever had but the false history that we are told gives him all the credit for the voting rights act. He had to sign it or they were going to expose him for killing JFK. Robert Kennedy would have exposed it if he had not been killed and he would have been elected President in 1968 instead of Nixon.

But to claim that ALL liberals are bad and evil and a \"disease\" is plainly ignorant. Yes there re \"bad apples\" on the left but equally as many on the right. And no the left is not communist, maybe a little socialist but not communism. FDR was a socialist and he pulled us out of the worst financial stage in American history: the great depression. So dont jump around like a bunch of uneducated Americans and say \"liberals are bad\" and \"socialism will ruin the country\" when really you should just fact check yourselves. I do it, not many do it including liberals do it. But I am one of the few that actually care and therefore find the facts, not opinions.",

How can he know what it’s like to sit in a hospital watching your child die? How can he know the struggle of wondering how you’re going to pay for that hospital care? This is not against Kanye in fact my comments are not against anyone. It is just my preference that our president make an attempt to come down to the level of the people he serves and understand the life of his people. People on the sites attack Democrats and point fingers and called names. That is not American. Americans care for each other and it would be nice to see an example not only on these sites in the comments but from our leader ship. I am an American. I love all other Americans regardless of their Politics. I love each person here who has commented that they want someone to die or be killed or set on fire or any of the other horrible things I read. I send you love and compassion.

Let's take the idea of TrumpCare to a world wide platform. Basically we take the Affordable Care Act and bring it up to the UN and World Bank. Anyone who wants healthcare in the world that can pay something can get it. This favors everybody, especially those who travel abroad because it adds to TrumpCare. Now there is a cheap travelers insurance for average joe American. In turn our TrumpCare in the US becomes cheaper becomes we have support from the World Bank and UN Delegates. How we handle those who go abroad is different you have to let your TrumpCare agent know for possible adjustments. This will help us travel easily to out best friend countries!!! Maybe it can help Average Joe in not so friendly countries that we have to travel to. I think it would be a great idea. - Prince Roby Pariyanickal Mathew.",

Five entire apartment complexes are evicting all tenants and plenty of people are without their homes because of water damage and they are forced to live with friends or relatives or are still stuck in shelters. Fema barely even mentioned the idea of 'fema trailers' for all these people last week (after someone asked a question about it) but they hadn't even discussed it with the governor of NC yet. In fact the director of fema mentioned that even if they began the process they would still have to figure out where to put them, how to get power and water to them and how to overcome local regulations. It didn't sound encouraging at all. Also, a family friend who has lived in her home in Wilmington for years, whose house was heavily damaged by collapsing trees and who isn't rich by any means, was just denied fema assistance. Don't buy into the idea of a quick and positive recovery.",

Now he needs to turn on the switch, and turn to black people, and literally say “What have you got to lose? Your lowest unemployment rate EVER? Dems attacking you for having thoughts that differ from theirs? For the first time ever, you actually have something to lose. Remember that.”\nThese cities, liberal run cities, get money by using the violence in black neighborhoods, but then use that money for illegals to have lawyers, and to take down Confederate statues, or ‘offensive’ statues and signs, instead of putting that money into the communities that actually need the money.\nAs Dems cry about the Justice System towards blacks, why do they get illegals million dollar lawyers, yet allow blacks, who are being locked up at higher rates, deal with court appointed bums who have 500 cases? Weird.\nBlacks need to start holding Dems accountable, and they can see it coming, and they are turning blacks against blacks to fight the battle for their rich, white asses.\nKanye showed a strength that none of these other entertainment cowards have, he didn’t bow down to mob mentality. He didn’t allow himself to be forced into a line of thought. What that proved, to me, is he’s probably the most educated one in the industry.",
