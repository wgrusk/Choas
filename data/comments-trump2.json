I also believe that may not be the appropriate manners to criticize successor‚Äôs governing leadership, let Americans to feel, sense, learn by their own feelings according to America‚Äôs own principles.  This is why I totally understand that why President Bush 41and President Bush 43 never want to criticize their successors, but let New President to lead and govern by their own styles and let Americans of all to evaluate themselves.  Their attitude is to support and help newly elected President to lead and govern only according to our country America‚Äôs own principles of either election laws or Constitution only.  Also I believe that during the Presidency campaign, Mr. Trump shouldn‚Äôt say Gov. Bush is low energy person, because people‚Äôs madness really had nothing to do with Gov. Bush at all, he was a great Governor of Florida.  Although it was campaign, still it was our own manners and appreciation for great, good, better, ok services and contributions to our country.  Although it was the debate, after that, still are friends for America‚Äôs greatness to work out together instead of hurting or others, I guess.  Surely elected President Trump has learned much after he became elected President Trump.  I believe that he learned quickly and worked very hard without paychecks and achieved some important things with Congress altogether or his administration.  I believe that it‚Äôs time for all of us to unite together again by our country America‚Äôs principles from now on and in the future and our own generous mind of forgiveness to put our energy, time and financial resources to achieve greatness by getting things done quickly together again.  America‚Äôs principles and unity together are the strength of our country by learning experience to understand more and do better things from now on and in the future.  I also believe and wish that Gov. Bush‚Äôs quality will be able to serve and contribute together again for America‚Äôs greatness by the principles as well as by elected President Trump‚Äôs leadership wisdom of generosity for America‚Äôs greatness.  One step further, unity and getting things done quickly altogether won‚Äôt be too hard to achieve.  Not easy to be generous mind as ordinary Americans, not to hard to achieve the unity by generosity, kindness and wisdom through learning experiences as governing leaderships, I guess.  Let‚Äôs be united together by our country America‚Äôs own principles of freedom and equality of the opportunities and patriotism and loyalty toward America‚Äôs greatness.  God bless America always.",

Well then the ridiculing was probably justified, no Americans took Trump serious back then when it came to him actually being our president & on top of that not many people even thought that he would ever run nor have the chance to win if he did run. ( including myself )¬† ( Back then is when he was bring up Obama's birth certificate and sh!t like that, Americans just wasn't have'n non of it, to many real problems to be talking about something so silly as that, is what most people here thought ) ( you see back then Trump was playing the republican and Democrat game, meaning he was being a normal politician ) . \nMost Americans really started paying attention to President Trump when he ran against H. Clinton. Trump was just being himself, taking no BullSh!t from the media and most importantly he was actually giving Ideas and some solutions if elected pres. AND HE WAS FEIRCLY STICK'N BY HIS OWN BELIEFS AND IDEAS ASWELL, WHICH WAS SUPER RARE TO DO SO EXSPECIASLLY SO EARLY IN THE PROCESS OF RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT., In the political world that is a big no no cause they don't wanna be to attached to firm stance on nothing until they become president, just in case they have to flop or switch later on before the actual election takes place, ( they don't wanna lose votes ) I only explain it like this cause I know nothing about yhall's process of election and not sure what u know about ours ............ Anyways Trump generally has 2 types of supporters here in America. 1st type of supporters , they are the republicans till I die and that's just the way it is, ( they play the game ) 2nd type ( which is what I am ) we are the ones who vote for the man or woman that we feel will do the best job, we are the ones who were really impressed with trump through the election process ( impressed and at the same time in disbelief because of the way he was single handedly putting the media in there place.) He was saying on the highest platform available in the world to say it, say what many of us Americans wish we could say and be heard by the world, and that is *WE AMERICANS ARE TIRED OF BEING BETRAYED BY THE MEDIA, THEY DON'T SPEAK FOR US AND GENERALLY DONT REPERSENT WHAT MOST AMERICANS REALLY ARE LIKE,¬† THEYRE ALWAYS TRYING TO PERTRAY US AS FU(KING IDDIOTS WHO WILL BELIVE ANYTHING, AND ALWAYS MAKING IT SOUND LIKE¬† WE ARE ALL IN 1GROUP OR THE OTHER, 1 SIDE OR THE OTHER, AND ECT. ECT................... WHEN REALLY MOST OF US DONT BELIEVE NON OF THEIR ASSES, FOX CNN , NONE OF THEM, WERE TIRED OF THEIR GAMES AND BULLSH!T. I don't agree with everything President Trump says or does. Some things are down right wrong but I believe if he can just stay focused on why he ran for pres. and come back to some sense of calm¬†¬† he will get a lot accomplished and make a lot of Americans proud. ( fyi I liked Obama too but I knew he was a politician meaning same O same O , ya know? )\nI don't like politics & never would I claim to be in 1 of they're fake @ss republican or Democratic groups ta play da game of corruption. *I do understand the real purpose of our gov creating these groups though. The real reason for creating them is 1 of if not the only reason that the USA became the most powerful country to ever run this earth and while now days it plays a part but isn't the main reason that the USA runs shyt now days but its def. still relevant. The main reason for creating them was to give an illusion to the rest of the world that their is actually 2 USA govs 1 dem. & 2 Rep. The purpose was and is so when a rep. or a dem.¬† pres is in office he can bomb da h&ll outta whoever he wants or cause the damage needed to accomplish there agendas. Then depending on the damage he does is how the gov decides if the other party needs to be elected and smooth out the mess while the new president symantaneously on a global level puts down the last pres that created it. This creates the illiusion of separation when in all actuality there is no separation just a long ever changing plan that exists. To be honest though I I hope its ever lasting as well because while even though I don't like it, the truth, If were not running the show no more that can only mean one thing and that thing is, SOMEONE ELSE IS RUNNING THE WORLD AND CREATING A NEW GAME MAYBE NOT AS SECRETIVE AS OUR GOV'S BUT WHO KNOWS MAYBE MUCH MORE BLUNT AND BRUTA;.*IMMIGRATION concerns Solution ! There should be A Center in every major city in America where for the next 6 months Any person in the United States Illegally can go too with the promise of no penalties for already existing or living here illegally and a lenient fast tracked process to citizenship. After the 6 months is up , CLOSE THE CENTERS & THEN THE ICE AGENCY SHOULD GO HARD AND REALLY PUT TOGETHER A PLAN TO GET THE ONES WHO DIDNT REPORT IN FOR CITIZENSHIP FOR THOSE 6 MONTHS, GET'EM OUT OF HERE!¬†¬†¬† IF THIS HAPPENS HOW CAN ANYBODY FEEL BAD FOR THOSE WHO DIDNT GO TO THE CENTER TO GET CITIZENSHIP ?¬†¬† WE CANT FEEL BAD AFTER THAT !¬† I FEEL BAD RIGHT NOW THOUGFH FOR ANY PEOPLE GETTING KICKED OUT OF OUR COUNTRY JUST BECAUSE THEY WAS DOING WHAT ANY OF US WOULD DO AND THATS TRY AND GIVE OUR FAMILIES A BETTER LIFE ! real talk",

I could bet you he could not last a week  or say month in a regular life as typical Amercian in a day to day go work come home take care of the family live off the food tge average American families do. I d love to see that. Never will happen why because in reality he is the loser not to know what real happiness is or Real Love. The man has been married 3 times he is adultery type. I would not want be him when he meets our Creator. You know money can buy alot of things on Earth. But it cant buy your way to Heaven nor can it buy real happiness that most  of us as poor and middle class Americans work hard for. God Bless America. Donald Trump is a joke in the White House.

When Obama was viciously  attacked,  he never spent more then 2 mins complaining about the person. No whining from President Obama. As he repeatedly told US, \"'The buck stops here!'\"   Oh yeah,  he killed three of the world's enemies,  put national health insurance in place, worked for everybody  without attention to the so-called race or nationality or religion or creed of people.  Obama never got caught with his ass/face exposed (as trump-da-rump'\"shithole countries'\" historical statement) never once refered to himself as a \"' stable genius \"' because most geniuses are not stable.  Obama wears his genius quietly!  Besides all of the other presidential  achievements,  Obama worked for more then three hours per day.  Kept  US  well informed with eloquence, grace,  humor, and respect for American citizens.  Unlike trump-da-rump,,  Obama is an honorable  man.  He shows love to his family.  We will  remember The Obama Presidency as the best of times because Obama always rose to any situation  with poise, intelligence, invested knowing the facts and history,  deep knowlege and respect of the laws of our land and government,  a calm show of strength through adversity,  patience and gentleness toward our children.   Thank you President Obama, for you wonderful service!",

He has signed more e orders that do absolutely no justice for the American ppl in 9 months then obama did in 8 years. Obama has made alot happen during his first hundred days thru legislative assembly and TRUMP not 1 single thing. The hypocrite of all time. God we made the biggest mistake.",

If you still love this man, I hope you open your eyes soon, because he is going to make America worse for us. Woman who voted for him, don't you feel violated after he said he'll grab woman by the *****? Native Americans, he has built casinos on our lands and has violated our ancestors with the genocide in celebration of Columbus day. Chinese people, trump says he loves your country even though he attacked your country 10 times. Asians, aren't you torn by the administration move on affirmative action? Black people, I really don't know what to say at this point considering I know you all hate his guts. South Americans, he threatened you and can affect your currency. Canadians, he's picking a fight with you and is bluntly calling you the enemy. Koreans, I don't know what to say about you considering you're wanting to Nuke us.

Henry Kissinger hoping the president to focus on the USA's real issues while those attacks are obstruction or distraction of saving the USA and themselves and have to be dealed with reasonably necessarily. While Nixon, kissinger and associates working tirelessly toward the  progress of world peace during 70's, can you be another pioneer?",

You're gonna reward Hillary, and Bill and Barack Hussein and try to destroy Sheriff Joe and President Trump. William Jefferson Clinton, Barrack Hussein Obama, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Their finished, long gone. What a sham. What kind of a show are you guys puttin' on here today? The only class in this act is sitting in the position of POTUS right here and now, Donald Trump! And his soul and integrity are intact! It's non-negotiable. A lot of Washington swamp scum have offered to to buy out his integrity etc., but Trump isn't selling. You people, LGBT, Anti Americans, Liberals, Communists, ANTIFA, Black Lives Matter, Liberals, Democrats, Anarchists, KKK, White Lives Matter, Neo Nazis etc. are trying to destroy rule of law, and amputate the spirit of America, you want to execute the very soul of true Americans and Patriots and bring this country down to your level of thinking, living and decadence. And why? Because Trump wants to enforce the law of the land and make America Great. Well, Bill, Barrack, Hillary, and all you anti-Americans and other political, anti-american, hate mongering entities wherever you are right now, just accept the man. It might be a tough nut to swallow, but get used to it, he is a role model for real Americana. Stop hating and embrace him, he will make all of you proud someday. Oh, and remember this, to be the man, you got to beat the man, and no one could do that either legal or illegal in our last Presidential race.o\n\nHitler inspired hope, when Germany needed it, is that bad? Barrack is or has done the same as Hitler did, but much more cleverly, more like a true Politician (Snake in the grass) would do. The seeds of dissent he has sown over the past 8 years of his Presidency are more evident now than ever perceived or imagined, Mission Accomplished! He is the one single reason why this country is so divided now. Even now he cannot stay out of the political picture, keeps sowing dissent and trying to keep America divided. He is a mouth piece, the great Orator, he has hate for America, hate and disgust and contempt for his own family, deeply rooted, I truly think he he would more than love to see America weakened and divided, just as he is himself. He has been experiencing an identity crisis for quiet sometime, mostly rooted in his upbringing, a mixture of communist/democratic ideological messages, mix of black/white/ethnicity and conflicting religious conviction (Muslim/Christian) influences and a sexual identity crisis which has been going on for sometime now. This I would say makes him more likely the Devils Advocate. He was and always will be the President who accomplished nothing, who always straddled the fence (or something else)! He is a talker, not a doer. Even now he is the main architect for the next Democratic contender against American Patriots in the next Presidential race.",

I have often wondered why ANYONE who is not wealthy would think  highly of this River-City con man. But the answer is below. Stupid, racist people who somehow believe this guy has ANYTHING in common with common people.  He only cares about and respects RICH PEOPLE. He's said it numerous times. His policies shit on his \"base\" and then goes there to hold a \"rally\" to make himself feel good.   He's only in office to make money. It is political usury. He's further enriched  himself, friends and family since he took office, ignoring all rules, laws in place, safeguards and protocol.  We're all paying for his record-setting number of golf trips to his owvresorts where he charges the govt. for the transpo  It's beyond stupid to think he gives a DAMN about you unless you are rich and white.

Unlike the usual parade of lying lawyers who wait for the latest (bogus) media poll to tell them what side their bread is buttered on. \n\nI still can't believe Donald did it. Everyday I say a prayer for him and this country and our world... For peace and prosperity for all 7.2 billion of us.",

Obamacare is too integrated, and at best it will be tweaked, it will not be repealed. We will fund every cent for that wall, guaranteed. His followers will blindly support him no matter what because in their minds they'd rather be in ruins with him then to have a black president. I hated obama for his policies, I was shocked at how many blatantly disliked him because he wasn't white, it was so obvious. Kasich would have been a great choice for president, level headed, he spearheaded Ohios opiate crisis which was the worst in the nation, and he rebuilt their economy into one of the strongest. Seeing so much of the GOP oppose him proves he isn't going to work out, I'm sick of seeing people call others traitors for not blindly supporting this asshat.",

    "commentText": "Is Mr. Trump like King Cyrus?\nMr. Trump is not like King Cyrus ‚Äì as many Christians are saying But he is like Nimrod who thought he could over throw heaven by building a tower. Everything Trump stands for is against what Jesus stands for. He thinks he has impressed God & man by bragging about all the towers he has build & that will get him into heaven! \nLike most  Christians today who are carnally minded -  Romans 8:6-10 - enmity against God! That is why a lot of Christians voted for Trump they like the way he thinks & is living & taking advantage of others.\nHypocrites - Pastors living in luxury being supported by their followers while many of them are having trouble keeping a roof over their head. Crying out about all the abortions that are happening while they abort Jesus in their hearts by not keeping the commandments of God! Wordshipping what mans hands has created like Eiffel's Tower & his Statue of Liberty or Trump's Towers! Not turning the other cheek but hitting back like Trump's tweets ‚Äì lies  ‚Äì torture or kill their enemy instead of praying for them! Like Trump wanting to bring back waterboarding or have Snowen killed for treason!\nMr.Trump thinks it is OK to covet your neighbor‚Äôs wife & goods. He even covets is own daughter! Brags about his sins then whats to blame them on others! Like Trump telling his wife Billy Bush cause him to speakout all his locker-room talk when Jesus said what comes out of your mouth comes from your heart not from someone urging you on { 2 Tim. 3:1-5 - -1 But mark this: 1-There will be terrible times in the last days. 2-People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, 3-without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, 4-treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God - 5-having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with such people. } Trump's locker-room talk was bragging & admitting to sexual abuse of women & so called Chirstians voted him in office because someone phophesied he would win! }-\nThere is more Fake News out to make Mr.Trump lusting after married woman & his own daughter look good again! Trump is the swamp so how can he drain it - as it would destroy him! You are one sick person that needs Jesus in your life if you are believing all the fake news about Mr.Trump. Most Christians voted for him because they would rather kill their enemy then pray for them. Like the Crusades who were told that by killing their enemy they would take back the Holy Land & go to heaven! Jesus said that his Kingdom was not of this world but most Christians would disagree with Him!\nMany Wars have been fought over religious beliefs but not one on God's Love - Jesus Said - Love your enemies & do good to them which hate you - Bless them that curse you & pray for them which despitefully use you - turn the other cheek - Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy - Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer & you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him - as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise - Trump is opening himself up so anyone can use the old testament as a means to kill his neigbour - An eye for an eye & a tooth for a tooth & both the old & new testament as a reason to own slaves again { Slaves in reverent fear of God submit yourselves to your masters, not only to those who are good & considerate, but also to those who are harsh! } America is heading to another civil war because of religious beliefs & Trumps Sickness! But Not on God's Love! - ISIS is killing others over their religious beliefs so shouldn't they be able to continue to do so under Trumps new law! I'm sure Trump & many others would like to have sex slaves or more than 1 wive after all Abraham started 2 nations with his wive & her handmaiden & Jacob started a nation by his 2 wives & their handmaidens that has become many nations just as God told Adraham he would be the father of many nations was fulfilled when 10 lost tribes never returned to the promised land but have become other nations in other lands & have been fighting amongst themselves ever since. Just as Jesus started the Christian movement based on Love & many religious teachings not just the Jewish ones has now become many forms of religious beliefs & they too have been fighting amongst themselves! That is why the Jewish leaders hated Jesus He was trying to destroy their way of thinking  An eye for an eye & a tooth for a tooth & replace it with Love instead. Most Christians are not walking in love that is why they voted Trump in office!  He is - An eye for an eye & a tooth for a tooth type of person - not like the type of person in { 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 ‚Äì NIV - 4-Love is patient - love is kind. It does not envy - it does not boast - it is not proud. 5-It does not dishonour others - it is not self-seeking - it is not easily angered - it keeps no record of wrongs. 6-Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7-It always protects - always trusts - always hopes - always perseveres. }\nThe 1st Nation people should of build a wall to keep out people like Mr.Trump who is making America Hate the wrong things again! The 1st illegal immigrants like Mr.Trump killed their enemies instead of praying for them! & then pushed 1st nation people onto reservations enslaved Black people  & then called themselves Christians! Mexicans where here in America long before people like Mr.Trump was! I'm a Christian & God has showen me the stupidy of all of this! They did not do unto others as they would want done to themselves! Now more than ever we need Gods Help to protect ourselves from ourselves. { Hosea 4-6 - My people are destroyed from lack of knowledge. \"Because you have rejected knowledge, I also reject you as my priests; because you have ignored the law of your God, -{ 1st Love God then love your neighbour as yourself } I also will ignore your children.}-\nGuess what if you can't  love God you will not be able to love your neighbour or yourself! When God took His spiritual hands off of the people in the bible they turn on each other killing their own people { 1 Samuel 14:20  +  Judges 7:22  +  2 Chronicles 20:23  +  Isaiah 19:2  +  Ezekiel 38:21 } now do you think - this is Gods Love causing theses people to turn against each other or Satan's hate for man! They even ate their own children when God drew back His Spirit. Read your Bible. Not to long ago a homosexual killed & ate his own partner ‚Äì was this God.s Love that caused him to do this ‚Äì I love you so much I could eat you ‚Äì how often have you heard people say that!  Satan put Mr.Trump in the white house to start another civil war in USA. A war of hate of man ‚Äì man against man ‚Äì Satans hate of man for not wordshipping him! Satan is the God of this world who is causing man to hate his neighbour - not Jesus - but Yeshua does want to be the God of your world! Say yes to Jesus!",

I am not the only one in charge. I am not the only one playing this world in a mind game diplomatic affairs. We have other presidents in the world, we have other leaders that we need to be diplomatic about, find their weakness and attack from there. It's called \"Diplomatic Policy\" which we have to take pretty seriously. Why do you think we have so much security, so much \"Eye\" seeing everything, including network? We have to watch out to open doors to our weakness or wounds for our enemies to attack us - and yes, ENEMIES, because no one wants to play \"The Good Guy, Make Earth A Better Place\" card game, only WEAK and listen, weak countries are doing so. And we can't rely on weak countries. They are already getting attacked from inside and outside. We would merely be giving some of our power and share it with them, and without good results lose both. This is how it is right now, we have to be playing a mind game with everyone. We can't trust anyone, because they don't trust us. We don't know, and we are paranoid - yes, paranoid, because we think every powerful leader would want to be the leader of Earth, and we just have to be careful and strong about this! Diplomacy is at hand!\nNo one wants WW3. It means the destruction of entire planet. This is the Fear we obide by!\"\n\nTrump: \"I know exactly what the fuck you are saying Obama. I know exactly what you are saying, you lying piece of shit weakling.\" and off to answering the journalist.\n\"He is the worst president ever along with those who signed up for presidency. I am the best, and I will do it in the way of true power. You worry about WW3? I welcome it, because I am so sick and tired of playing this mother fucking mind game.\nI know the presidents and leaders I shake hands with aren't to be trusted. I know they are cruel and evil, I KNOOOOW that from my heart, but this is how I am going to play my game. This isn't a 'Win-win' situation for them. It's win-win situation for me, and you will see what I talk about. Do you think I fired comey because he was lying or not even swearing loyalty to me, or even faking the 'tapes'. The tapes don't even make sense. They mean NOTHING. It's just a distraction. I fired him because he was weak. I fired him because he was under you Obama, and I want someone from my own staff. Someone I bred, taught, educated, and a part of my existence, a part of my soul that I can rely on with conscious and confidence - total conscious and confidence, someone that understands my thoughts in future, current, and past. You say this is a mind game policy game we are playing.\nYou will see how I am going to play it. There are no rules, the only rule is for America to win!\"",

Remember the tough talking, savvy, rich guy who was going to solve all of our problems and make America great again.  Remember his obnoxious criticism of the prior administration.  Insinuating President Obama was weak, suggesting that he wasn't intelligent, suggesting that he was incompetent, predicting that Obama was going to fail miserably.  I remember him huffing and puffing as he declared Obama to be the worst president in American history.  Trump promised his supporters that he was going make great deals, and the worlds leaders were going to respect him, Isis was going to fear him and there would be peace when he became president, because Americans would finally have a strong leader.  Remember that?  It was a sham to me from day one but Americans lost their minds and voted for him.  Many voted for him against their better judgement because they thought he was going to bring about positive change in American politics.  They thought because he was a savvy business man, he was going to fix the economy over night.  Then he won the election.  Donald J Trump became POTUS.  \n\nThough I never trusted Trump, I was willing to see what he was going to do, and he showed me.  He started off by lying openly about the crowds and it didn't stop there.  Donald has headed an administration in turmoil from the beginning.  Appointing wealth bankers and business men to important cabinet positions.  In-fussing his family into government positions. He appointed individuals of dubious character, with extreme views and questionable alliances as advisers.  He has headed an administration in utter chaos and turmoil; plagued with scandal after, after scandal, after scandal.  He has proven himself to be a pathological liar.  He has insulted our allies while exalting our enemies even in the face of that enemy, in spite of the fact that evidence suggested that enemy meant us harm.  He has turned American credibility into a joke and has made us the laughing stock of the world.  He tweets policy in social media, he publicly accuses prior administrations of committing crime against him without evidence or any basis in fact.  He has divulged our secrets and has made decisions that prove him to be unstable and incompetent.  Five months in office and there is a serious movement to impeach him.  His presidency has become the brunt of everyone's jokes.  Five month in office and he is already becoming the worst president in American History.\n\nAnd the other guy?  You know, President Obama?  He completed his second term with an 8 year scandal free administration.  The economy and unemployment records at record lows, he is revered by our allies and was able to leave office with a very high approval rating.  Incompetent?  Absolutely not!!!!!!!",

I mean, on the bright side, Donald Trump is helping our country, and has made some great changes since our history went downhill.

    "commentText": "Dear Conservative, \n\nThe United States has never had a more tyrannical and overreaching President! He has absolutely no respect for the law or the Constitution and he can only be classified as a criminal! \n\nIn his 2014 ‚ÄúYear of Action,‚Äù President Obama has promised to go around Congress and act alone whenever possible. Rather than work with Congress, Barack Obama intends to rule the country by executive fiat. \n\nThe response in Congress has been startling. When Obama promised during his State of the Union to circumvent Congress with unconstitutional executive orders, Members of Congress actually stood up and cheered. Instead of fulfilling their Constitutional duties to write the law, Democrat Congressmen have actually begun drafting executive orders for the President to sign instead‚Ä¶ \n\nThat‚Äôs right, instead of introducing legislation for Congress to debate and vote on, Democrats are drafting executive orders for the President to sign directly. Texas Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee (D) says that the ‚Äú[Democrat] caucus will put us on the right path and we‚Äôll give President Obama a number of executive orders that he can sign with pride and strength.‚Äù The Democrats intend to make this their number one priority, Lee explains, and she urges her colleagues to ‚Äúwrite up these executive orders ‚Äî draft them, of course ‚Äî and ask the president to stand with us‚Ä¶‚Äù \n\nThe Democrats plan to push through a number of their most progressive policies by completely going around Congress. This is blatantly unconstitutional! What is even worse is the fact that Obama and the Democrats don‚Äôt seem to even care‚Ä¶ They believe that they are above the law and that they can‚Äôt be touched‚Ä¶ \n\nThey are wrong! They are NOT above the law! \n\nThankfully, the Constitution provides We the People with a means to stop this tyrannical President! We must force Congress to impeach President Barack Obama before it is too late! \n\nTake Action! Tell Congress to Impeach, Convict, and Arrest Barack Hussein Obama for high crimes committed against the American People and our Constitutional Republic! \n\nJust two months into his ‚ÄúYear of Action‚Äù when he intends to rule by executive fiat, Obama has issued a number of executive orders and directives that are neither constitutional nor logical. In many cases, the Supreme Court has already ruled that the President does not have the authority to do what he is doing. Yet, Obama continues on, daring you to stop him‚Ä¶ \n\nThe year began with Obama promising to sign Executive Order 13658 to increase the minimum wage for Federal contractors. This is unconstitutional! The Supreme Court has already ruled in Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co. v. Sawyer that ‚Äúthe President‚Äôs power, if any, to issue the [executive] order must stem either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.‚Äù The Court elaborates, explaining that ‚Äúwhen the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb.‚Äù Given the fact that Congress set the minimum wage and has yet to adjust it, any attempt by Obama to increase the minimum wage without Congress is blatantly unconstitutional! \n\nNext, the Obama administration unilaterally delayed Obamacare‚Äôs Employer Mandate for the second time! This marks the 28th time that Barack Obama has unconstitutionally changed, altered, or delayed elements of the Affordable Care Act. How do we know this was unconstitutional? Well, the Supreme Court has also ruled on this issue as well! The Supreme Court ruled in Clinton vs. City of New York that the President does not have the Constitutional authority to alter a law or statute, explaining that ‚Äúthere is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes the President to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.‚Äù The Affordable Care Act explicitly says that the Employer Mandate must go into effect on Jan. 1, 2013, however thanks to Obama‚Äôs lawlessness, this part of the law has been delayed until 2016. This is completely unconstitutional! \n\nLast year, when Congress refused to pass Obama‚Äôs DREAM Act, which would have legalized illegal aliens brought into this country as children, the President implemented the program anyway by ordering his administration not to deport any young illegal aliens. Now, Democrats are encouraging Barack Obama to extend this executive order to ALL illegal immigrants in the country! With one signature, Obama could order his administration to cease prosecuting illegal immigrants all together! Barack Obama must be impeached, and it should have happened years ago! \n\nTake Action! Tell Congress to Impeach, Convict, and Arrest Barack Hussein Obama for high crimes committed against the American People and our Constitutional Republic! \n\nCongress is starting to hear us. Both Republicans and Democrats recognize that the President‚Äôs executive orders and directives are ‚Äúlawless‚Äù and ‚Äúblatantly unconstitutional.‚Äù \n\nSen. Mike Lee has been one of the most vocal opponents of Obama‚Äôs unconstitutional executive orders. On Obama‚Äôs decision to delay the Employer Mandate again, Lee criticized the action as ‚Äúa shameless power grab‚Äù and that the ‚ÄúConstitution doesn‚Äôt give the President that power.‚Äù \n\nWhat does Mike Lee intend to do about this? Nothing! \n\nOn a recent Sunday morning talk show, Sen. Mike Lee agreed that Obama‚Äôs executive directives were tyrannical and lawless, but the Senator admitted that ‚Äúlittle can be done about it.‚Äù \n\nLittle can be done about it? What on earth is Mike Lee talking about? \n\nThe GOP has been touting the fact that 100 Congressional Republicans have signed onto the Stop This Overreaching President (STOP) Resolution. What the GOP doesn‚Äôt understand is that the American people don‚Äôt want a weak, unenforceable resolution that will eventually die in the Senate, anyway. The American people don‚Äôt want Congress to just act for the sake of acting. \n\nThere is only one way to definitively stop Barack Obama‚Äôs tyranny and the Constitution exclusively empowers Congress to do so through impeachment proceedings. Only Congress can stop Obama, yet they don‚Äôt even want to consider that measure! The founders didn‚Äôt intend for ‚Äòimpeachment‚Äô to be a taboo subject. The impeachment provision of the Constitution is designed as a mechanism for the American people and their representatives in Congress to stop a tyrannical and overbearing executive. \n\nJust two months into the year, Obama‚Äôs actions in 2014 alone warrant impeachment proceedings. Impeachment provides an opportunity for the President to answer to the American people directly. Yet, we aren‚Äôt only looking at what the President has done this year‚Ä¶ Obama has five previous years of unconstitutional executive orders and actions that pale in comparison to his recent efforts. \n\nHow about the fact that Obama gave rifles to Mexican drug cartels, who then used them to kill an American border patrol agent? That is a blatantly criminal act, yet, like Richard Nixon, Obama exerted executive privilege to keep his administration‚Äôs criminal acts classified! \n\nHow about the fact that when Americans were being ambushed by terrorists in Benghazi, Libya, Obama told the military to ‚Äústand down‚Äù and just let them die? \n\nHow about the fact that, like Richard Nixon, Barack Hussein Obama used the IRS to target and silence his political opponents? \n\nThe President has asserted that he possesses the authority to spy on your phone calls without warrant, infringe on your second amendment rights without cause, and assassinate American citizens abroad without due process! \n\nThis is tyranny and Congress must impeach Barack Obama now! \n\nTake Action! Tell Congress to Impeach, Convict, and Arrest Barack Hussein Obama for high crimes committed against the American People and our Constitutional Republic! \n\nA recent Economist poll finds that 71% of Obama voters regret voting for the President. It is no surprise that Obama‚Äôs approval rating is lower than ever. The American people overwhelmingly disagree with the President on every one of his policy proposals, yet the President continues to press on with his unpopular agenda. So, the American people voted for Congressmen and Senators who represent their interests. Instead of accepting that he is a lame-duck President, Barack Obama has pledged to go around Congress to unconstitutionally implement his agenda. \n\nCongress has an obligation to impeach, convict, and arrest this criminal President. That much is true. But, you also have an obligation to force Congress to act! You have a duty to hold Congress‚Äô feet to the fire and refuse to accept anything short of impeachment and conviction! \n\nOver the past week, more Congressmen and Senators have come out and voiced their support of impeachment proceedings. The candidates running to replace retiring and vulnerable legislators are deliberately making impeachment a part of their platforms. Why? Because the American people demand it! \n\nThe American people have had enough watching this President violate his oath of office and the constitution! The American people deserve answers. The President must answer for his crimes and only impeachment proceedings can force him to! \n\nTake Action! Tell Congress to Impeach, Convict, and Arrest Barack Hussein Obama for high crimes committed against the American People and our Constitutional Republic",

If America doesn't break free of this situation we will all suffer at the same hands that have taken Our Country down. Give Trump a honest chance n see what he can n will do very soon. I am optimistic for the first time in 3 decades that change to our old country's values will prevail n make America Great Again. I expect a serious environment of the leftists to disrupt his swearing in as President Trump. USSS has a very serious situation to provide the best they have to offer, an they'll need everyone's help to disrupt these leftists communists that have infiltrated govt highest offices an abc agencies. I don't trust Ovomit in any situation as he's proven to be a world class lying pos. Anyone connected to his administration should hang their heads low for the actions they've taken not to make things right to the American People. Last chance America, better pray that Trump is for real an does in fact creates jobs n have our ecomically stressed population witness better times. The last 3 decades have systematically placed our country is dire dangers as we all recognize as deception from the elites criminally insane. Pray America, an lets get to work supporting President Trump. If Ovomit doesn't start Ww3 an the China Sea conflict before leaving office in a few days.",

And for you lower and middle income folks out there who voted for Trump, just remember that the tax plan Trump wants to implement gives tax breaks to the wealthy.

I really believe if Clinton had gotten down and dirty and called him a narcissistic asshole during one of the debates (maybe right after he called her a \"nasty woman\"), that some of the rural uneducated that elected Trump may have respected her more and voted for her. That sort of talk seems to appeal to the rural and uneducated.",

Making executive decisions about the US economy is not quite like leasing your brand name to a series of hotels around the country.

He has no experience with politics and all he has done in his campaign is said he's going to start mass deportation, build a fucking wall and talked shit about the current president and Hillary. hes going to make america great again but has no idea how other than get rid of anyone that's not white. he's called entire races of people rapists and drug dealers. he has talked down to Americas military force, people who are dying for their country, saying the military is weak. he can't even answer the question in this fucking video. Obama says he's not prepared for presidency and he immediately starts bashing Obama saying Obama is the worst president ever. how can any human being watch what trump has done, and still vote for him. every person who is supporting trump is saying what he is doing is perfectly ok. every fucking person, that is sitting here defending his actions might as well sit in front of their children and be telling them that bullying, rape, hatred, racism and more is ok. Did everyone forget that this election is to decide who is going to run the united states of fucking america? this person is going to be a role model, someone little fucking kids are supposed to look up to. our children are going to grow up through 4 years with a racist, ignorant, sexual assaulting president and think that those action are ok because the president did it and everyone turned their fucking heads. America is great, vote trump in and allowing what he has done to just be ignored is what will make america a joke. \nwho can honestly say they want their children to look up to a racist. \nwho can actually go to sleep at night knowing their little girl is going to grow up the next 4 years knowing its ok for her to be degrade and assaulted just because she's a girl. \nwho is it ok for a presidential candidate to do all of these things but if a I smoke a plant to help me function normally I get sent to jail. \nhow can america let something like this get so out of hand. \nthis isn't a joke guys, this isn't a dream. if something is not done now, then I'm genuinely afraid, terrified, of what will happen in the next 4 years.",

Cut your losses with him and fetch someone better qualified, less secretive, with less false pride and more open to discussion and actual problem solving. He's a fucking business man! He's not interested in people - he wants money, because money makes power. And not for you, the sorry mass of dimwits flocking around him, but for him. Solely for himself. And while on the mention of him being a business man, remember he's a rather poor one at that. He didn't MAKE his fortune, he INHERITED it! On top of that, he nearly lost it, too! He insisted Obama show his birth certificate to prove him being born in the U.S., but he refuses to show his tax papers to prove he's not dead broke? Come on, it reeks of poor judgement from any voter's side to accept that from a public person and would-be leader. He is not a man who spreads a vibe of trustworthiness. 'Cause, let's face it, criticizing others isn't a way to make yourself look better, owning up to your own words and accusations is. He's every bit a lesser man than Obama and would make an insanely unfit president.",

I'm not saying that being pro-life is a bad thing. Everybody has their right to have an opinion, but most of the wars were started by religion. (Also over power.) Which if I;m being honest is all I think he's after. It's very typical for successful business men to go into politics.\n\nBut worst of all when Obama gives his opinion, all he starts screaming is: You're a bad president. It's a childish response.\nI like that Trump is not scared to speak his opinion in a non-political way. But I don't like his opinion... ( Or so to speak.)\n\nObama is one the greatest presidents America has ever had.\nI wish Michelle had been in this race for presidence.",

I WOULD Give you another Pocket Book of SHARIA and ask whether that book represents the American Beliefs Your son died for ? Do you subscribe with Sharia belief of Caliphate and NO democracy ? Do You subscribe and belief on sharia's Instruction on Polygamy, Abortion , Pluralism and Not Living in a land where ISLAM is NOT the state Religion ? Mr Khizr Khan If You have Graves of 13 Muslims died for USA in Arlington Grave then there are graves of 3000 people who died in 9/11 who has died as a result of the Values you Believe in did u ever go to those graves or any Muslim Cleric begged an Apology ? what about those graves ? What about the graves of Orlando & Paris and Nicee ? So If You have the courage Denounce Sharia Law in Public and publicly announce that it doesn't resemble the american belief system and\n\n ''DONT BECOME AN AMERICAN BY WEARING AN AMERICAN HAT BECOME BY HEART' AND RATHER THAN MAKING YOUR SONS SACRIFICE AS EMOTIONAL ISSUES TEACH YOUR COMMUNITY TO DENOUNCE SHARIA LAW AND BE ASSIMILATED IN A PLURALISTIC SOCIETY",

I wish we wouldn't have to settle for less, but we are in times of desperation. unfortunately, there have been no candidates that were able to make it to elections that have had these qualities. We really are just victims of ourselves. We failed to become or create the perfect leader for our nation, now we will suffer the outcome of this. What else to blame would be the fact that the election system is set to a certain amount of years each for term, so we only have that much time to come up with the next best president.",

I'm not making any claims if whether or not  trump is a happy person, but if you really pay attention to the way he acts and goes about topics, he doesn't exactly seem like much a pacifist, to say the least. especially the way trump made that first \"rebuttal\" to the clip they showed of Obama making a statement about trump. Out of a good candidate, I would expect, if any at all the most humble response to a statement like that. Not some charged up, angry spew of shit.

You \"love\" the guy if you share similar opinions and interests, you hate him if it's the opposite. that makes me think citizens who vote for trump must prefer him because they agree with his views, which, to me, is sad.  he reminds me of most everyday people I meet when they walk into dairy queen. personally, I want a president who is one of a kind. one that is truly wise and sophisticated. not a president that is going to agree with just about everything the old fashioned, racist, and ignorant crowds of people that live in America. the only reasonable explanation I can see that would explain the cause of trump's popularity is because he is a liar and he knows how to blend in with the crowd, after all, it seems like all some people want these days is someone to agree with them.",

It amazes me how people flat out reject the reality of what President Obama inherited and all of the opposition from the GOP. They literally shutdown the government to respond to Obama use of executive orders to force them to do their fucking jobs. History will paint a different picture of President Obama's tenure in the White House. Everyone criticizes his Iran nuclear deal yet over look all of the administrations prior to Obama failures to even get the Iranians to acknowledge the US. The US hasn't been able to work with Cuba in 90 years now we are building a relationship with them. Obama's the 1st president in history to call for suspending weapon sells to Israel and Saudis.

Mr Trump's rhetoric is encouraging terrorism because he is agitating an already angry group of people. Mr Trump does not show the ability to give a focused answer as he repeats himself and has three arguments going on at the same time. If we were to print this interview with mr Trump I am sure the text would make no sense at all. Because he doesn't make sense. \n\nLike I said, the world is scared... because whatever trouble happens to the US usually happens to all of us...",

This man is full of scars and sequels due to attacks on him, on his needs and on his richness. \n\nTHIS MAN THINKS OF USA AS BEING HIS OWN HOUSE\n- He uses the trash bucket when he has something to thrown. He doesn't get rid of the garbage around his living room, in hallways or in his bed;\n- He wants to protect his personal property, as each pulls up a fence around their house. He needs a front door to stop the others entering anytime and anywhere into his intimacy;\n- He want to be a member of this great family, whit all those together who maintains this house, where all should have equal rights. Mr. Trump thinks that a parent is obligated to love his offspring, sharing responsibilities that these children could support;\n- Mr. Trump thinks widely, looking for The Big Picture, even if for some people, with smaller thinking, this means tyranny. He wants each one to learn to make mistakes, from this being able to develop, but also to assume their own sins;\n- He is tired to be fooled by these great leaders, by these presumed parents, who should protect their children. How, the fuck, are you responsible, as a mom and as a dad, if you teach your boys to become barbarians, attacking other neighboring houses? How are you protective, with tutorial rights, if you allow that in your own home to enter and reside all kinds of foreign characters who believe that women don't have equal rights with men? What monstrous conceptions can develop your own daughters? \n\nWe are all like any other being and non-being of all the universe. We are as well as the asteroids in space. as all suns and the rest of this whole entire galaxy. \nIn fact we are this whole infinite as well; as the infinitesimal organisms that are the basis of the whole rest; the virus masses of everywhere, which also trying to thrive. And like the bee families, we are too - who need to beware of predators such as wasps. And I don't say that these thieves of honey and criminals of bees that are lower than anything else, but which themselves need to make their own place into this existence as anyone and anything else, into all this \"chaos\".\n\nI love the fascist thinking, but only a half of it. The history has taught us to learn from our mistakes. The tyranny is very useful, just as a parent sometimes must rebuke his own children.\nSo I love the Hitler‚Äôs thinking, but only a half of it, and Mr. Trump learn from our history mistakes as everybody and everything else. And from this it follows that I, a gypsy from Romania - my own tyrant of my family, I respect 100% the path of this man, Mr. Donald Trump.\n\nP.S. Forgive me if I didn't use correctly English, but my excuse is that I'm still learning and Google translate is my support.",

It is like he is trying to coach him and help him but Trump just won't listen.  He tries to do it in a smart way so that there will be sympathy with Trump's position with recent Media stories, yet the word's out of Trumps mouth just don't allow O'Reilly to actually sway the conversation in a way beneficial to Trump. He starts off with a quote from Obama related to Khan, and then when Trump when completely lost focus and starts talking about the fact that in a recent interview he was actually unaware that Russia invaded Ukraine after saying that Russia would never attack Ukraine he had to \"re-focus\" (O'Reilly's words) Trump to get him back to the subject. Let's face it, the Russia - Ukraine incident is a conversation even O'Reilly doesn't want to step into. Then he continues to try to paint Trump in a light in which Trump could be apologetic for the petty and unimportant comments he made about the Mother and in this way will solidify and cause forgetfulness about the real and important comments he made about the lost veteran, but Trump continues to deny his fault in anything. This makes O'Reillys job of looking like an antagonizer while actually swaying public opinion and sympathy towards Trump hard, and it also looks like the two have a past and O'Reilly clearly thinks he is much more intelligent than Trump, which he most certainly is. Trump probably tried to borrow O'Reillys Tempur-Pedic money to build a paper casino at one point and O'Reilly said no way Trump your corporations always claim bankruptcy to reduce what you have to pay to your creditors. Looks like some bad blood between these big wig businessmen at some point, but what do I know, I'm just a regular guy.",

    "commentText": "Under Democrats black Americans and all minorities have the highest unemployment rates, lowest amount of home ownership, lowest amount of high school and college graduate, highest poverty rates,  highest crime ridden and unsafe neighborhoods, highest drug and alcohol addictions, and near 75% of black children grow up without fathers.\n\nToday the overwhelming majority of black children are raised in single female-headed families. As early as the 1880s, three-quarters of black families were two-parent. In 1925 New York City, 85 percent of black families were two-parent. One study of 19th-century slave families found that in up to three-fourths of the families, all the children had the same mother and father.\n\nToday's black illegitimacy rate of nearly 75 percent is also entirely new. In 1940, black illegitimacy stood at 14 percent. It had risen to 25 percent by 1965, when Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote \"The Negro Family: The Case for National Action\" and was widely condemned as a racist. By 1980, the black illegitimacy rate had more than doubled, to 56 percent, and it has been growing since. Both during slavery and as late as 1920, a teenage girl raising a child without a man present was rare among blacks.\n\nMuch of today's pathology seen among many blacks is an outgrowth of the welfare state that has made self-destructive behavior less costly for the individual. Having children without the benefit of marriage is less burdensome if the mother receives housing subsidies, welfare payments and food stamps. Plus, the social stigma associated with unwed motherhood has vanished. Female-headed households, whether black or white, are a ticket for dependency and all of its associated problems. Ignored in all discussions is the fact that the poverty rate among black married couples has been in single digits since 1994.\n\nBlack youth unemployment in some cities is over 50 percent. But high black youth unemployment is also new. In 1948, the unemployment rate for black teens was slightly less than that of their white counterparts ‚Äî 9.4 percent compared with 10.2.\n\nDuring that same period, black youths were either just as active in the labor force or more so than white youths. Since the 1960s, both the labor force participation rate and the employment rate of black youths have fallen to what they are today. Why? Are employers more racially discriminatory today than yesteryear? Were black youths of yesteryear more skilled than whites of yesteryear? The answer to both questions is a big fat no.\n\nThe minimum wage law and other labor regulations have cut off the bottom rungs of the economic ladder. Put yourself in the place of an employer, and ask: If I must pay $7.25 an hour ‚Äî plus mandated fringes, such as Social Security and workers' compensation ‚Äî would it pay me to hire a worker who is so unfortunate as to possess skills that enable him to produce only $5 worth of value per hour? Most employers view that as a losing economic proposition. Thus, the minimum wage law discriminates against the employment of low-skilled workers, who are most often youths ‚Äî particularly black youths.\n\nThe little bit of money a teenager can earn through after-school, weekend and summer employment is not nearly so important as the other things he gains from early work experiences. He acquires skills and develops good work habits, such as being prompt, following orders and respecting supervisors. In addition, there are the self-respect and pride that a youngster gains from being financially semi-independent. All of these gains from early work experiences are important for any teen but are even more important for black teens. If black teens are going to learn anything that will make them a more valuable employee in the future, they aren't going to learn it from their rotten schools, their dysfunctional families or their crime-ridden neighborhoods. They must learn it on the job.\n\nThe bulk of today's problems for many blacks are a result of politicians and civil rights organizations using government in the name of helping blacks when in fact they are serving the purposes of powerful interest groups.",

It's over! Of course he will say it was \"rigged\" or someone \"cheated\" like the true sore loser that he is! I can't wait to hear his concession speech. He will blame blame blame and not accept any fault for his heinous actions, lying and saying he wanted his donation to the veterans to be private,yet later brags about donating 6 million dollars which is proven to be UNTRUE,attacking a gold star mom, mocking a disabled reporter,the NRA comment, Isis was founded by Obama which he said over and over again,,then says it was \"sarcasm\" to just name a few. He CAN'T admit that he f'd up by saying what he did to that Gold Star mom. See how he dances around it and blames the media and says what he often does that \"many people were talking about about this and that.\" Many many people were NOT saying \"go after the gold star mom. ANOTHER LIE!  We are smarter than that. Many people did not say anything bad about that Gold Star mom which he wants to claim..even if that was true, does that make it right? Isn't he smart enough to know that attacking her would back fire.  ‚Ä¶. HE alone caused himself to loose this election!

I‚Äôm not saying Trump donated money to NAMBLA, but people are saying that. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve heard, but I don‚Äôt believe Donald Trump donated several million dollars to NAMBLA over the last several years. Still, if he did that would be a great reason to not release his tax returns. But look, I‚Äôm not here to say whether or not Donald Trump donated millions to NAMBLA, I‚Äôm just here to let you know that every candidate has released his tax returns over the last 40 years, so there has to be a reason he doesn‚Äôt, and several very smart people are saying he contributed millions of dollars to NAMBLA.",

There is so so much disagreement with his actions because it doesn't fill the needs of everyone, or of his skin color, or because uneducated people make an assumption from listening through the grape vine. He is not someone looking to take power for THE power. He  wants to help. And make peace. This is not what I see through Donald Trump. He's not even educated enough to recognize Obama's insult and begin maturely defending himself. If the kind of people who see this man as great are going to choose him over someone who, although I cannot clearly argue Clinton's  supremacy, are seemingly more structured and comfortable in the white house and it's grandeur of decisions, then I have lost hope of the idea that America could finally be the country to move forward in advancements for all aspects of our dear human lives.",

It's not necessary but yet continues , it's making me wonder if it's not being done on purpose . Does he really want to be President ? The reality that he may win maybe scaring him to death .",

TRUMP made the right allusion to sharia islam which is an undemocratic, barbaric inhumane muslim set of governance.  \n\nKhan waves the constitution at Trump because Khan is a muslim immigration lawyer who operates in corrupt EB-5 pay to play visas, attacked Trump, because his son would never have died for America if it were up to Trump.\n\nNow anyone who has had some interaction with muslims, you will find that muslims accuse America of the most vile atrocities and corruption, most of based on the fact that it is America that prevents the muslims from wiping Israel of the map. \n\nMuslims want you to believe that the 5 dancing Israelis committed 9/11, or Bush and the Freemasons. Muslims spread the rumour that 9/11 was not a islamic jihad but a mossad plot. In all this sits Hillary Clinton who voted for the Iraq war, including many of the GOP50 who denounce Trump.  Under Obama, Hillary turned Libya into another Afghanistan and. The two of them openly support the Muslim Brotherhood especially in Egypt. \n\nObama and the Clintons are the total enablers of the Islamic State in Babylon, Iraq. Without their assistance they could never have gotten as far as they have for so long.  Obama is funneling American kaffir money to aid extremist jihadist muslims to overthrow the Syrian govt.  Without America, this war would have been over a long time ago already. \n\nVOTE TRUMP to stop this MAdness. Hillary is downright evil.  Her criminal camp is killing of people whom would expose her, or are perceived as having double crossed her.  \n\nWE ARE FED UP with Clinton and her criminal corrupt cabal.  TRUMP IS THE MAN to do the work of a wrecking ball to BREAK this criminal stronghold over the West.  He will fire every incompetent snivelling anti-american from out of the govt.  \n\nMuslims pay allegiance to islam first of all.  They cannot be patriots and be muslims at the same time.  I would say that the son of Khan was an apostate or he was a muslim plant who died because he thought that iraqi muslim lives were more important that his own muslim hide. The problem was that Americans were shooting off \"innocent\" iraqis who attempted to enter the camp without following the rules. Khan's son was trying to prevent this from happening when a muslim did a suicide murder jihad on him.  This is the war that appears to be universally accepted us unjustified.  This is the war that Bush, Hillary Clinton and McCain, among others, voted for.  America was not supposed to be in Iraq at all.  \n\nObama made sure that whatever good America did in Iraq was undone.  Even left behind a nice stockpile of arms and equipment for ISIS to sieze with the Iraqi soldier receiving orders to vacate and run away.  Rather odd.  Billions of military equipment.  All of this was done under the watchful eye of Hillary Clinton.  \n\nBill Clinton is the one that bombed the serbians and handed over Kosovo to the muslims.  It is considered a resounding victory for islam.  The Serbians whom were illegally occupied by muslim invaders wanted to rid themselves from muslims whom were continuously engaged in violent and stealth jihad on the kaffirs and apostates.  Bill gave the muslims that one.\n\nAll the while the Clintons are embroiled with receiving large donations from muslims at the Clinton Foundation.  Clinton appointed herself as the enforcer of hate crimes against those who blaspheme islam.  Benghazi and the anti-islam video as the cause of it, all comes down to setting a precedent that will prevent people from drawing cartoons of mahomet, the false prophet etc.  \n\nThere is no way that any sane person will vote for Hillary Clinton.  If you do, you are most certainly wilfully ignorant.  \nSeth Rich also thought that Clinton assassinations were just an urban legend. He died.",

Your glib and horrifying comment about \"Second Amendment people\" was heard around the world. It was heard by sane and decent people who shudder at your fondness for verbal violence. It was heard by your supporters, many of whom gleefully and angrily yell, \"Lock her up!\" at your rallies. It was heard by the person sitting alone in a room, locked in his own dark fantasies, who sees unbridled violence as a way to make his mark in the world, and is just looking for ideas. Yes, Mr. Trump, words matter. But then you know that, which makes this all even more horrifying.",

That's like if I voted for trump just because he's white that makes me racist. And I'm Hispanic from Texas! I mm going to vote for who I think will do a better job and will keep America safe, appoint a justice that sticks to the constitution, fight terrorism. How you going to give Iran 400 million in cash and not expect Some of it to be used by Terrorist? This election just woke a lot of people up that have been asleep for a long time. Wake up!",

I speak very well.\" \"I think I have the right, am I supposed to not have the right to at least say something back?\"\n\nO'Reilly mentions the wife of Mr. Khan and how attacking her essentially \"opens a door for them to come in and hammer you as this mean kinda guy.\"\n\nTrump responds, \"I read a lot and I watch a lot and many many people discuss this.\" \"So when I said it became a big deal, and that's, you know, the way it is.\" \"I was very viciously attacked and I said not very viciously back.\" \"The press.. just kept it going and never stopped and honestly it's too bad.\"\n\n\"You can come at me, but if there's some little muslim woman who loses a son you can't, you just can't no matter what she does - she could set you on fire and you could say \"thank you I hated those trousers, you know.. you just gotta let it go\"\n\nTrump responded, \"Well...

Why isn't the shariah in the Muslim countries getting rid of hunger, thirst, rape, and civil war? Again, the shariah answer is shariah to everything! Why are Muslims migrating to the EU and to America? It's because of a better humanitarian  stable civilization. Plus their shariah has failed them. Europe and America have a better opportunity, for all kind of religions or personal situations. Now you want to spread your corrupted fantasy which can't even build a hair gel, thorough out the west. Trying to destabilize the stabilized! rather than trying to establish the shariah, and stabilizing your own country where you came from. Maybe an ISIS Islamic shariah is your answer to a peaceful Islamic civilizations. An ISIS shariah is your desire, your final shariah country system result, for defining a shariah an ISIS peaceful civilization is the shariah answer. It's the example, the shariah answer you want to implement in the western world. Heck I don't want to see violence, rape and slavery, thirst and hunger, in Europe. If it's only peaceful, anywhere in the world, stable and consistent. Example; Europe and the American citizens will then migrate there or visit you. For relationship and business. Religion and development have different angles to building and developing a country. U.K and the Western world, wasn't build from religion. It was build from hard work, science, passion, and industrial civil engineering. It was built by builders!! not religiousness! STOP mixing religion with the development of the country. Religion is not the fastest way to build a strong global civilization.  Corrupted psychological fantasy civilization. The mental psychological cause to rape, unsafe, civil war, extremism, in the Arab world. RELIGION is not the answer TO DEVELOPMENT OF THE  AFRICAN MIDDLE EASTERN, DESSERT!

Trump doesn't need the left press to attack his character, he's rotten to the core and fully able to show it, whether it be talking about muslims, talking about mexicans, minorities in general, his general objectification of women, his admiration for dictators, his willingness to commit war crimes, humanity crimes for results (he mentioned doing worse than waterboarding and killing the families of terrorists).\n\nHow can you Trump supporters live with yourselves supporting a man like that ? You've been had. A fat rich con artist has pulled one over your eyes, and made you think he's the only possible solution when he is the problem.\nYou've been brainwashed into thinking Trump can solve your problems, but the guy doesn't know the first thing about politics (outside of how to convince people he matters), how to run a country, how to handle foreign issues.\nThe whole world is largely critical of Trump and in many countries such an extreme candidate wouldn't even be able to go a fourth of the way he went.\nLike i said earlier, it seems only dictators have endorsed trump. \nWhat more do you want ? how far will you let him go until you realize what a monster he is ?",

There are also other awesome aspects of your salvation only I direct you to a good bible believing church or another believer or wherever God leads you to .",

( not one bit) we live in a fallen world and it will only get worse. What is important is where will you be going after you die . Think about it ? Everyone of us started dying the moment we were born. And why is this? It started with Adam and Eve and their rebellion in the garden . They ate from the one tree that God asked them not to. Hence the FALL. To make a long story short God the father sent God the son to earth as a man to redeem man , Jesus the Christ was the only way this could be done . All of gods wrath was placed on Jesus thereby getting us off the hook. God is no longer at odds with sinful man as Jesus paid the entire bill that we owed . Hence the term GOSPEL which means ( good news) but more precisely ( nearly to good to be true news) so what now ? SIMPLE you and me and everyone needs to either accept or reject this .",

Kahn for his heroic service to our country and sympathize with the Kahn family in our shared loss of a beloved son, that is where my support for them stops.¬† While they have every right to speak out, their actions when they appeared on stage at the behest of the Hillary campaign have, sadly, politicized Gold Star families.¬† This past week, the Kahn‚Äôs have been on\nnumerous television shows, and their story has been heard from coast to coast.¬† While I hesitate to further politicize this issue, I feel like, to be fair, my voice should be heard, as well. ¬†The Kahn family does not speak for me.\nThose of you who are old enough to remember Paul Harvey know that it‚Äôs always a good idea to ‚Äúlook at the rest of the story.‚Äù¬† I did so and suggest that those reading this letter do so, as well, so you can draw conclusions.¬† As for me, after learning more about Khizr Kahn‚Äôs affiliations and the mission of his law firm, I found that it could be construed that Kahn used his son‚Äôs sacrifice and his elevated status as a Gold Star father to advance his agenda in a very public way.¬† I find that very distasteful.¬† I am not fooled by Kahn sanctimoniously\nwaving a copy of our Constitution on national TV, and I can recognize an\norchestrated setup when I see one.¬† Enough said!\n\nNow, let‚Äôs see if we can turn our thoughts back to the important issues that face our country, as there are many!Nancy Hecker\nColorado Springs",

Ukraine  was with Russia but the group who wanted to be part of Europe they have plans already take the presider out and put someone that they can control the main reason is to stop buying gas and oil from Russia and start business with Qatar and for this they needed Ukraine land to Run a pipe line From Qatar thru Crimea and into Europe do to the circumstances Putin Decide to Defend all the Russian citizen from this non government group and stop there intentions so he take Crimea back because when they give to them there was no papers sing or anything saying this Crimea that is a bout the sizes of Texas was part of Ukraine.so when he send troops he was not attacking  Ukraine but tho group that wanted to be part of Europe and Ukraine Gorverment cant't control. than USA and Europe decide to go against Russia and start putting sanctions cut the business between Russia and Europe or USA the intention of USA was to cut all the food imports to Russian what Russia did is to start producing everything  locally  they have touch land for agriculture on the south that they have good whether. that they try to make them week with the Currency the dollar went up and the Ruble went to the ground when this happen Putin plays his cards very well he stay down and all the foreign companies enter in panic and start selling than Putin Buy them off for pennies and kick them off it looks like the more harm  USA want to do to Russia is useless. it just funny all the media how is manipulated by the government to sell us lies. i was living in Russia for the last 10 years.",

That soldier is a fucking hero. A hero who gave his life so we don't have to. Then Trump trivializes a purple heart that was just handed to him... because he's never had to earn a goddamn thing in his entire life. Every single problem he ever faced, either He, or Daddy Trump threw money at at made it go away. Vietnam.. \"oh he has bone spurs\" FIVE medical deferments to keep him from active duty. He was given a 'small ' loan of a million dollars.. in roughly 1970.. if you adjust for inflation thats $4,557,321.77   THEN he got the rest of the billions his father had when Daddy Trump Died... Hard work and Sacrifice? This Chump knows nothing about either, other than making  other people do both for his repeatedly failing businesses. He's filed for 4 bankruptcies.  'Reorganizations' because he has the business sense of a failing highschooler. Are we really even thinking about making him leader and commander in chief of our nation?

He just has his  own way to respond back. He is a very competitive person and driven to see this country become better than it is. Hence, if elected into office, I am sure he will proactively take measures to protect, improve, & make living in America a better place than it has become.   we can all only hope - but the hope ship of Obama has sailed!",

This little girl, as stated in the news, was raped, and urinated on by three Syrian refugee boys of the ages 8, 11, and 13. The boys took her at knife point into a laundry room and proceeded to take part on the previous stated actions which was videotaped by the eldest boy. The father was also caught on tape high fiving the boys for their actions. The incident as well as the video was submitted to the police department. However, due to a language barrier, and the ages of the children involved, this case is being sealed. Many people in this community are in awe, and outraged that no consequences are being served to these boys nor their parents for this vile incident.\nhttps://www.jihadwatch.org/2016/06/idaho-residents-call-for-justice-for-5-year-old-girl-raped-by-muslim-migrants-perps-remain-unpunished",

The American people are like sheep, how could the press who are owned by key interest groups be fair, and the Americans are eating it up.  No one owns this guy and the American people should be happy about that.  America is being run into the ground by politicians wouldn't be refreshing to see what a nonpolitical candidate could do? We often hear of how we need to show our kids to speak their minds, be confident be yourselves and stand up for your ideas.  Is that not what Trump is all about in action.   The media loves him for the ratings but they are terribly bias. Hilary is the worst type of politician and the only thing that would be nice about her is that USA would have it's first woman president either than that I hate everything she stands for.",

    "commentText": "Harvard Republican ClubDear Members and Alumni,In every presidential election since 1888, the members and Executive Board of the Harvard Republican Club have gathered to discuss, debate, and eventually endorse the standard-bearer of our party. But for the first time in 128 years, we, the oldest College Republicans chapter in the nation, will not be endorsing the Republican nominee.Donald Trump holds views that are antithetical to our values not only as Republicans, but as Americans. The rhetoric he espouses ‚Äìfrom racist slander to misogynistic taunts‚Äì is not consistent with our conservative principles, and his repeated mocking of the disabled and belittling of the sacrifices made by prisoners of war, Gold Star families, and Purple Heart recipients is not only bad politics, but absurdly cruel.If enacted, Donald Trump‚Äôs platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad. Domestically, his protectionist trade policies and draconian immigration restrictions would enlarge our federal deficit, raise prices for consumers, and throw our economy back into recession. Trump‚Äôs global outlook, steeped in isolationism, is considerably out-of-step with the traditional Republican stance as well. The flippancy with which he is willing to abdicate the United States‚Äô responsibility to lead is alarming. Calling for the US‚Äô withdrawal from NATO and actively endorsing nuclear proliferation, Donald Trump‚Äôs foreign policy would wreak havoc on the established world order which has held aggressive foreign powers in check since World War II.Perhaps most importantly, however, Donald Trump simply does not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the United States through an increasingly perilous world. The last week should have made obvious to all what has been obvious to most for more than a year. In response to any slight ‚Äìperceived or real‚Äì Donald Trump lashes out viciously and irresponsibly. In Trump‚Äôs eyes, disagreement with his actions or his policies warrants incessant name calling and derision: stupid, lying, fat, ugly, weak, failing, idiot ‚Äìand that‚Äôs just his ‚Äúfellow‚Äù Republicans.He isn‚Äôt eschewing political correctness. He is eschewing basic human decency.Donald Trump, despite spending more than a year on the campaign trail, has either refused or been unable to educate himself on issues that matter most to Americans like us. He speaks only in platitudes, about greatness, success, and winning. Time and time again, Trump has demonstrated his complete lack of knowledge on critical matters, meandering from position to position over the course of the election. When confronted about these frequent reversals, Trump lies in a manner more brazen and shameless than anything politics has ever seen.Millions of people across the country are feeling despondent. Their hours have been cut, wages slashed, jobs even shipped overseas. But Donald Trump doesn‚Äôt have a plan to fix that. He has a plan to exploit that.Donald Trump is a threat to the survival of the Republic. His authoritarian tendencies and flirtations with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy. He hopes to divide us by race, by class, and by religion, instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the White House. He is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor, friend against friend, American against American. We will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our children. President Reagan called on us to maintain this, our shining city on a hill. He called on us to maintain freedom abroad by keeping a strong presence in the world. He called on us to maintain liberty at home by upholding the democratic process and respecting our opponents. He called on us to maintain decency in our hearts by loving our neighbor.He would be ashamed of Donald Trump. We are too. This fall, we will instead focus our efforts on reclaiming the Republican Party from those who have done it considerable harm, campaigning for candidates who will uphold the conservative principles that have defined the Republican Party for generations. We will work to ensure both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands, continuing to protect against executive overreach regardless of who wins the election this November.We call on our party‚Äôs elected leaders to renounce their support of Donald Trump, and urge our fellow College Republicans to join us in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this dangerous man. The conservative movement in America should not and will not go quietly into the night.A longtime student of American democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville once said, ‚ÄúAmerica is great because she is good. If America ceases to be good, America will cease to be great.‚Äù De Tocqueville believed in the United States. Americans are a decent people. We work hard, protect our own, and look out for one another in times of need, regardless of the color of our skin, the God we worship, or our party registration. Donald Trump may not believe in that America, but we do. And that America will never cease to be great.The Harvard Republican Club",

What years was America greater than it is today? \n\nThis is a question that me and 99% of the rest of the world is asking: Why the fuck are you voting for a childish psycopath with outdated views of the world¬†to be in the most powerful position in the world??? Who is supported by the leaders of Russia and North Korea. That tells me a lot. \n\nThanks for answers!",

Are there any decent people in the Democratic Party, who recognize the depths current leaders will go to to win what they want?

Whereas, I would NEVER vote for the Benghazi Butcher, Hillery, even if hers was the only name on the ballot. \n\nHaving said that, one thing I can't help noticing about Trump is his compulsive fixation with getting in the last word all the time. He seems to be lacking certain discernment capabilities....when to respond to criticism and when it just isn't important enough to offer a response.  \n\nFor example: He never should have bothered responding to Khan's wife at all.  She and what she had to say, are both totally important. \n\nBut, for some reason Trump feels as though he needs respond to everybody and everything with the final word. This type of behavior is going to wear the man completely out before his second year in office!  \n\nRight now it's only the Communist Left Trump has to deal with. Just think how it will be when he's facing all world's leaders as our National Representative. It is my hope, Trump will, by then, learn how to focus his energy....and his responses....on only important matters that arise,  and leave all that other non-important baggage laying by the wayside where it belongs.  \n\nSome things are simply too far beneath Trump's pay grade to warrant any kind of  response from him personally.    \nJust a thought. :0) Cheers!",

Maybe you should also point out then how FoxNews is actually losing ratings lately... and losing respect from all the other media houses because of their rookie media coverage. As an econ student most of the times when I listen to Trump I want to shoot myself because most of his plans are not realistically possible. And a lot of what he says is complete and utter lie which no one bothers to check. -.-",

He may have many \"strong\" businesses, but it falters many times as well. Now, being a president is not just about business, but also about understanding the foreign policies. He speaks vaguely about MANY things and especially foreign policies. He's like one of those people that read the article headlines then completely bullcrap everything to they \"know\" from their understandings of the  headlines and knows NOTHING about the actual details of the articles. He makes accusations that aren't backed up with persuasive facts. Now, if we factor in his personality then HOLY FUCK - it is just fucking disgusting. Yes. \"fuck\" is the only way I can describe the horrendous, ignorant, and disrespectful person he is. Yeah yeah....he doesn't like to be \"politically correct'. That's fine, you don't have to. I actually respect people who aren't a puppet, but you're supposed to be a decent person above all. Also, if you don't have some strong connections in the office then well....your ideas will face a lot of difficulties becoming a law. When your own parties are against you then I'm not sure how you're gonna pass the laws you are promising (if he does figure out a plan for these laws). Therefore, he's gonna end up being a \"liar\" because what he promised will have a hard time finding itself into the real world. For christ sake, you're a leader. Help people believe that they should trust you. \n\nThis man is gonna represent our country, and I'd rather not travel the world with his face and personality representing my country. I hate Hillary because she's a liar, but of the two, she looks like the only one who can get  things done in the office. Now, it may be unfair of me to say that Trump has never given the chance to do anything in politics, and you're absolutely right. As a result, I just simply want to hear his goals, and AT LEAST the rough drafts of how he is going to get to those goals. That will show me that he knows that he's talking about and whether he's the man/woman for the job. I'm neither a Republic or a Democrat currently, but I am for sure an American. \n\nLook. All I'm saying is I want a person in the office that knows what they are doing. You can make all the great advertisements, but if I don't know how it works then I can't stand behind the products, the ideas, or the source. You cannot criticize anyone unless you have a better plan.\n\nIf you disagree with me, please talk about it. Be civil. Please. If you do agree, then like this so others can see it too.",

Andrew Jackson for example, practically made a depression by printing countless amounts of money. Or Reagan, who contrary to popular belief wasn't a great president at all. In terms of economics, he did terrible. He was on of the main reasons the economy has such a high debt today. He may have ended the Cold War, but he did in the wrong way. You can't lower taxes and increase government spending. Where does the other money come from? Investors, and lenders. I mean a lot of presidents were bad or just completely useless sometimes, including Obama in my opinion, but he's not the worst, that's probably Jackson.",

The problem is that the Khan are the parents of an American hero who died protecting other soldiers and this nation. Candidates should never, never and never attack the grieving parents of fallen heroes because Americans won't go for that. Comrade Trump is a jackasssss.",

Judy Woodruff's interview with the Khans was pathetic whining as she asked questions.   It is not a all clear that Captain Khan is being honor by using his death as a political ploy.  Women in Islam do not have the same rights as men.  For example a man can divorce his wife by saying 'I divorce you' three times in a months time.  A woman has a very hard time to get a divorce and if she does the man has the primary care of their children.  This discussion needs to happen.  So Mr. Trump is right.  The media though uses this as a means of attack.  Mrs. Khan was on a national stage evidently wanting her presence to reinforce what her husband said.  Then there is Mrs. Pat Smith who was told her feelings about losing her son did not count.  Is she not a Gold Star mother?",
