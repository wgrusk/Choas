Youll find her performance here is identical to how a fraud would portray this. \nBut... \nlets look at rape. \nHe had no weapon.  He made no action or comment that suggested hed hurt her if she resisted.  So she just laid there and let him do this? \nOkay... \nSo hes holding her down,  holding her hands and legs (and trust me,  if someone were doing that to me theyd have a HARD time restraining me)  so he rapes her while she just lays there hoping itll be over quick. \nHe orgasms,  lays there,  keeps restraining her while his penis goes soft, maintains his hold on her until he can get another erection and then he rapes her again? \n\nDid she scream for help like ....she was being raped?  Did she do everything she could to get out from under him?  How did he restrain both arms,  both legs so she couldnt get away? \nNo man could rape me without a weapon or convincing me that if i didnt get away i wouldnt live. \n\nPlus she adds her guilt... \nand portrays hillary like theyre these scary,  powerful people who terrorized her. \nGIVE ME A BREAK! \nNO 35 YEAR OLD WOMAN IS SO BIG A VICTIM THAT SHE HAS NO RATIONAL THOUGHT. \n\nAfter watching this video,  I am convinced she is a fraud. \nI am no fan of Hillary's and especially not of her husband,  but no one deserves this kind of false allegation.  I hope there is a special place in hell for people who are willing to lie like this. \nMaybe she has a dying relative and needs the money, maybe shes being blackmailed by a republican to say this. \nBut there is no excuse or amount of money that makes making a false rape allegation ok.",

With the aid of her lawyers she filed a deposition in which she said she was not raped, but did not deny having sex with him. \n\nThe deposition was filed in lieu of being questioned in person, and the Jones lawyers could have challenged it, and the judge could have ordered her to testify, but apparently they did not catch the fact that it only denied rape. \n\nNow, why deny rape, but not deny sex? Maybe because denying sex would have been perjury, since it was a sworn statement. Denying sex would have had the same chance of avoiding testifying as denying rape, but might have been perjury.\n\nSo, if denying rape was a lie, that carries the same penalty as denying sex, yet she only denied rape. Why? That is the question that has to be answered. \n\nThen there is the fact that so many women who accused BC had a paycheck as their motive, did Broaddrick? \n\nThat is why I don't believe her. Was the lying then, or is she lying now? Since lying then carried a prison sentence possible, and now has a paycheck possible, which do we chose?",

Bill is a price of shit, but I don't see how this affects Hillary",

Again I'm not trying to discredit her i think that it's important to point that out and to also point out that they are supporting a man who's being accused of making women feel exactly the way that they say that they felt and he's bragged about it for years that's the difference here",

A platform they should have had from other people a long time ago,, if the rape is true, and it seems to me that it is-i wish these women to find a platform--bcs these kid of ruth needs to be spoken out! but not supporting a man is acting like trump. bcs you women get abused through this a second time!

    "commentText": "Consider the fact -- as compared to her recent and past statements in television interviews -- that twice, the only times Juanita Broaddrick was placed in a position where she was legally obligated to confirm or deny the veracity of her allegations against Bill Clinton (first, in a sworn affidavit, under oath as \"Jane Doe 5\", under a 1997 subpoena by Paula Jones' lawyers; and then again, in 1998, in a sworn deposition in the same case), she denied that these events actually happened.  Even during the Kenneth Starr investigations of Clinton, Broaddrick was determined to not be a credible witness.  I'm not pretending to claim with 100% certainty that her claims are/were false -- but why, given the chance to implicate Clinton, even anonymously, as \"Jane Doe 5\", in the Paula Jones harassment case, did she state, in her own words, that there were \"no unwelcome sexual \nadvances‚Äù, that there was \"no truth to the rumors\", and that ‚Äúthese allegations are untrue\"?  How is it wise for anyone to put blind faith in the words of any individual, regardless of their political affiliations, who makes certain claims in public that they are unwilling to substantiate in private and under oath?",

This woman was a Clinton supporter in his run for governor of Arkansas in 1978. She was married to Gary Hickey at the time of the alleged incident (April 1978),¬†but she was carrying on an affair with a married man named David Broaddrick (whom later left his wife and married Juanita in 1981). She claims that she suffered a swelled lip from it being \"sucked on\" during the alleged incident, and that she told her then husband, Gary Hickey,¬†that she accidentally injured her lip, but¬†Gary Hickey has stated that he did not remember her lip injury, or her explanation. Juanita Broaddrick attended a Clinton Fund Raiser, 3-Weeks after the alleged event took place. Juanita Broaddrick, herself, asked her local paper (The Van Buren Press) to cover a visit by¬†Clinton to¬†the Nursing Home she worked at in her home town of¬†Van Buren AR, in \"1990\" (there are pictures of the two of them together at this event). An FBI investigation, headed by¬†the infamous \"Kenneth Starr\", found the¬†evidence against Mr. Clinton \"INCONCLUSIVE\". Their were no eye witnesses¬†seeing Bill Clinton arrive, or leave, the Camelot Hotel (where the alleged incident took place), on the day of the alleged incident (4/25/78). It took me all of 10 minutes to look up these facts via GOOGLE. Look, could this women have been raped by Bill Clinton? I honestly don't know, and no one but herself, and Bill, knows for sure.¬†But I do¬†know this, anyone can make a¬†allegations,¬†and there have been¬†no two people in history that has had more¬†lies told about them, and¬†false allegations waged against them, than Bill and Hillary Clinton. Oh, and last time I checked, Bill isn't running for president!",

And Donald Trump was very astute the other night - she indeed has much hatred in her heart.",

Please note before you comment, that she isn't \"just now coming out with the allegations\", they were made decades ago.. And the reason she agreed to be interviewed about it now is because she is terrified of Hillary being in the white house. Is Trump running against Bill? No, but Hillary supported him after the (15/16?) alleged rapes, and assisted him in threatening and silencing victims, which is likely why they remained allegations. Plus, have you never heard about suspicious deaths that occur to those who attempt to betray the Clinton campaigns? I think the count is at about 50, and you can easily find many videos of people who claim to have been threatened by the Clintons, again decades before this election. These interviews are hugely relevant, considering half of Clinton's campaign has been about \"bringing up women\", and if you actually watched this video, you would notice an ironic tweet of hers mentioning how she supports rape victims. Do your research before you doom yourselves, people!",

They don't come more credible than Juanita Broaddrick. Bill raped her physically and Hillary did it psychologically. And there are scores of other women the Clintons victimized and left by the wayside in their pursuit for power. In college, Bill was thrown out of Oxford for raping a woman, but a State Department contact wiped the entire matter clean because Bill was actually working for the CIA at the time monitoring anti Vietnam war protests in England. ¬†\nFor people wondering why we are hearing about this now, it's because the media has been absolutely complicit in covering up for the Clintons for decades. Andrea Mitchell interviewed Broaddrick back in the 90's and the minute Broaddrick started talking about the rape and the viciousness of the assault, they stopped filming and said, \"We're not going to go there.\" Worse yet, after Mitchell completed the half-assed interview, NBC kept the film in the can for several months and didn't air the interview on television until AFTER Clinton was elected.",

Back in 1999 Trump agreed with Bill Clinton and even insulted these women. Hillary on the other hand had to deal with learning about how her husband who she loves, cheated on her several times and raped women. Most of you don't know what that's like so don't judge Hillary on her actions. No, I am not saying that everything Hillary says is right but people make mistakes and she truly cares for women and their rights, being a woman who has gone through something similar.

The Clinton's are master manipulators and twist everything to their advantage.  People, Hillary isn't going to do anything for us, except let possible terrorists in the county, another recession, unemployment, more illegals to support. The list goes on and on...When are people going to open their eyes and ears and listen to what's going on? Trump may not be the best choice for us, but at least he won't screw us. He's been telling it like it is from the very beginning. He does not sugar coat. It is what it is. Yes, Trump does use salty language and does not talk like a politician, but he's telling us the truth about the Clinton's. He's spending is own money to save us from a Hillary administration. He's the only outsider with the balls and the money to try to save this country from total destruction. If you guys vote for Hillary thinking you're getting a good deal, think again. She will do absolutely nothing for you. She hasn't done anything fro the past 30 years. What makes you think she'll do anything now? All of her so-called successes have all been failures. So, people you really need to think hard about putting her in the oval office. We will all get a raw deal with Hillary. Think I'm kidding? Just wait and see, but then it will all be too late. If you're satisfied with the way this country is headed, if you're satisfied with possibly having ISIS as your neighbor, if you're satisfied with your health care, if you're satisfied with working harder and getting nowhere, if you're satisfied with paying more taxes, if you're satisfied with getting screwed, then you know who to vote for. If you really want a change for the better, then you know who to vote for. Just don't complain when you start feeling the sandpaper, or even worse...the barb wire.",

Questionable integrity there on their behalf.  I'm sure the media would have been happy to hear their stories, but to put this in his family box at the debate (and for them to accept after he personally demeaned them and defended  Bill (I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that all of them weren't aware of this) is DEPLORABLE.  The good news if he loses: he can go back to sexually assaulting women without all the media attention.  Grab em by the pussy Donald, Melania said It's OK.... If he would release his current employees from contracts keeping them quite I'm sure we'd hear some real horror stories.  Is Bill Clinton perfect, no, but he's not running for president, Hillary is.  Is she perfect, no, but has she admitted openly to molesting people against their will? Last time I checked no, and I'm sure Donald would be retweeting it at 3 AM if he could find anything close.",

Hillary ain't perfect at all and if she really bullied those women than like wtf that's horrible! But that was a long time ago! Same for trump he did a lot of mistakes years ago that are being brought up! But I'm judging them by their campaigns now not their past bc people change! From what I've seen trump hasn't learned anything and regret anything bc he keeps on doing the mistakes from the past!",

If she wants to know what it's really like, she needs to talk to some real victims.  Clinton is many things, and no politician is \"clean\", but I don't think she's done anything other that regret sex  she got into long after the fact.  Regret is not the same mechanism as revenge.",

Now that she is finding the courage to tell her story, people have the audacity to be critical of her, to question her, to ridicule her, to thumb her down in this video?  We need a culture in which it is safe for women to come out about these issues. Ms. Broaddrick is one woman in a long list of Clinton's rape victims, and if you think Hillary didn't know about her husband's actions, your ignorance is not excusable.  \n\nUnfortunately we are in the strangest election.  We have the choice between a serial braggart, self-aggrandizing peacock and a professional liar who flip-flops on issues depending on voter sentiment, dishonest, email-deleting, the only first lady to ever be subpoenaed, the only first lady to aid in trashing the white house on her way out (i mean immature crap like gluing the keys on all the keyboards), let's not forget white water, travel gate, and insider trading.\n\nSo for those who thumb this down, for those who won't vote for Trump because he is not presidential, how can you find solace with Hillary.  I would rather go with the guy that the political machine has fought so hard to sabotage, rather than the one who has gotten special treatment the whole way through.  But then, I want the system to change, not more of the same.",

With such an emotionally charged subject for myself and countless others coupled with a plea , under oddly controlled \"on/off\" crying, to please don't vote for Hillary..how can I NOT considered refusing to give her my vote. I just saying the timing is very strange for her to come forward and being so afraid...isn't the fear still there? shouldn't she be just as afraid to make a video like this, over the possible \"consequences\"  should Hillary get elected? this is designed to be emotionally charge  attempt at swaying my vote over something that has not been proven and the timing of revealing it does not make sense, because she could have very well brought it up during during one of the two Term Obama was in office. \n\nThe interviewer wreaks of someone hired to scandalize someone running for office. Someone pointed her in his direction, as I'm sure she didn't just find him (this interviewer) on her own on her own someone put him there, and for a specific purpose. His questions sounds like he wants her to follow his direction and help her to be ever so careful as to not break character. \n\nThis has been the dirtiest back and forth opponent bashing I have ever seen before an election, ever.",

So I am very sorry, but as long as she does, I don't believe a word of it. Why is he never even questioned about any rape or assault and if she knew, how does she know that for sure, maybe she thought she was just another fling of his, coz he did cheeted on her. So Im not convinced, sorry, coz I don't like to doubt any victem. But in this case, it's been atleast 20 yrs ago, so to proof either way is impossible, esp in this election, where there are already so many lies, from both sides of the Isle. But after all is said and done, we have to choose between these two, a degenerate and a woman with bagage. I take her over him any day, but after she's elected, the ppl have to get engaged in their political sc√®ne, from schoolboards to the cityhall to the Senate and vote down the ticket upcoming years, so we can change this rediciulous two Party system that hasn't really worked for most of us. That's probebly why Obama has gotten 30 yrs older in 8 yrs time, he underestemaited their hatred for him as POTUS. A black man telling us what to do? The thought alone..... And so he became a ghost of the man he was before he got into the White House....",

Sure, you can argue that \"the truth must be revealed about the clintons\" but think about why you may argue that. And if your reason is \"for the sake of convincing others to vote someone else\" then fine. But this was handled badly. She could have handled this in a more private way, contacting the clintons, sitting down face to face, and find closure, clarification, and somewhat forgiveness. Or at least file a report. Clinton was already impeached for sexual allegations. But that doesn't mean his wife will be advocative of that and intend to be that, either. You put something private like that out to the world, and the world will eat that up, causing the people on the other side of the story to back into a corner and not say anything about it. I would like to know the clintons' take on this story. But if this causes them not to say anything, then it is like it is the world's media to blame, because they basically said \"let's get some confidential leverage over them, and let's see how they handle it\".

Trump has a lawsuit of raping a 13 yr old, still on going,  did you as a rape victim reach out to that 13 yrs old girl? \n10th.  you didn't reach out for that 13yr girl, why are you trying to speak out on behalf of someone that is also on trial for doing the samething  that happened to you. \nwhile am sorry for what happened, I think you just hate Hillary and you are not afraid of her and she's not going to hurt you, you just hate her and like Lewinsky, you're using your story for political purpose. since you think Trump is not like on that tape 11 yrs ago, why can't Hillary change,  Trump can change,  but Hillary can't.  that was 20yrs ago and Hillary been advocating for women since, if she fell short she made up for it and after the trial she never messed with you and you still scared of her? give me a break mam, get a grip, we see through what you're doing.\n you just pull victims of rape backwards, you should be against what happened on that tape,   but yet you backed it and still endorse Trump, you're a raped victim that became an opportunist and that's the damn truth.",

    "commentText": "People ask how Clinton got away with raping this woman. He got away with it because she didn't report it. You can't wait years to report a rape and expect anyone to do anything about it. You have to do it immediately after the crime happens. I totally feel her pain, but she has no proof that it ever happened. I believe her. She's told the story quite a few times and she doesn't change it. However, at the time she was married to one man and having an affair with another man, one who became her current husband. Back then they would have crucified her in court because they would have brought her personal life in to use as evidence against her. Often rape victims are subjected to having their personal life dissected even though the rapist doesn't get the same treatment. Had she reported it immediately and had he been arrested though, he would have went on trial and he would have never become President of the United States. The statement she claims that Hillary Clinton said to her at one of his rallies/fund raisers years after the rape just doesn't ring true because it is something a candidate's wife would say to anyone to thank them for coming.  Also, why would Broaddrick as a rape victim attend a Clinton event?",

So JB's story requires that Bill said to his wife, \"I had sex with this woman.\"  Either that, or Hillary knew her husband so well that it was obvious that JB would be one of the kinds of women that Bill would have had sex with.  More than that, JB is saying that Hillary also knew that what happened was non-consensual.\n\n2:51 - On the topic of consent, this is the first time I've heard a woman stating that \"...he did it again\", in a case of rape.  I expect that people who study such crimes have stats on how common it might be for a man to force himself on a woman more than a single time while the woman is continually expressing objection to what is happening.\n\nThese two points in the video are difficult for me to comprehend.  So maybe someone can explain these in a way that makes sense to me.  I would have liked to have heard the interviewer ask about it himself.  Something like:\n- How do you think Hillary came to know what happened?\n- After the first time ended, what effort did you make to get away?",

One, because I highly doubt the questions were brought to her attention before the interview was underway, and two, the simple suggestion or permission a private journalist attempts to secure, is handled in the most excruciating approaches, such as the appeal amplification, using emotional drama to stir an experience that has not even once, officially closed (at least in her perception) and the varying fallacies used by corporatism to make another dollar.\n\nWas she aware that these questions were going to be exploitative? Was she given a guarantee that her trauma would be respected, and to forgo the explicit details one must penetrate, in order to reminisce a dire, life-changing situation?\n\nOr was this the original intention of Ms. Broaddrick? Is she in, on this appeal to emotion?\n\nNone of these answers can be answered objectively by any, one of us. We can at best, only speculate....which is the entire purpose of this charade?\n\nBut maybe I'm biased... I will be voting for Trump...

Its very convenient for Trump that this lady is just now accusing Bill of raping her. My advice to people that never question anything is that you shouldnt believe everything you hear. Like I said, Im not sure, I wasnt there and there isnt any evidence. Also, Trump has a lot of money and this story could hurt Hillary's campaign.

Neither can win on moral grounds, neither is clean, and unfortunately these are the kind of leaders America is projecting to the world. Rest of the world must be literally laughing at this election. Every day I turn on the news, there is there is something about their dirty past. Leaders are supposed to set an example, not be a misogynist, not be an 'enabler', not a crook. Forget these candidates. why is this country not able to find a leader who deems fit to be a president. Some one who is first a moral human being. And the sad part is both these candidates have followers despite their frailties and are pig-headedly backing their candidates, instead of questioning them! I just want this election to be over! So freaking depressing!",

This would be damaging if he were a candidate. \n\nJust like Trump has been damaged heavily by saying that he likes to grab women \"By the pussy\".\n\nUNLESS of course there is a recording of Hillary saying she likes to grab guys \"By the cock\".\n\nor \"Suck that cock dry\" or \"Shove that cock so deep in her pussy that it comes out of her mouth\" or \"Slap Donald Trump with her big old cock\" or if she had said \"Donald Trump is a whiny little cunt and I would love to plant one in his asshole in the same manner he tried to grab my pussy\".\n\nI think the media has blown things WAY out of proportion because he did NOT say \"I want to grab them by the cunt\", he just said \"pussy\"......and now you can say \"pussy\" on television, so it is not a big deal.\n\nNow if he had said \"I want to pound that pussy so hard it bleeds and the bitch falls unconscious......a bit of the old Billy Cosby\" that might be a story, but all he said was that he likes to just grab them by the pussy. Which is not a big deal. Though next time he should use the word Coos-snootch. Sort of a wink wink........where we know what he is talking about, but most people would not. This way the social justice warriors out there can't go crying home to mommy.\n\nAll these whiny PC bitches just can't handle the way a real man talks. It is not like he said \"I want to ass rape this cunt, stick her in my dungeon and fuck every hole in her body until she passes out from exhaustion\" because obviously had he said something like that he might not win. Saying that he likes to grab them by the pussy does not exclude a person from being president.",

If Donald Trump had been in that position he would have said that they were asking for it and that they just did it for show and that it wasn't rape at all. He may have even commented on what he thought of their appearances and called them sluts or something else that is to disgusting to be in a YouTube comment. I would much rather vote for a person who puts herself and her family and her career over all of woman rather than a person who just sees women as cattle that can be judged and slept with.",

If one accepts this explanation\none must also accept the power or drive of the survival instinct, appears to have neither. I find this extraordinarily difficult to believe.",

That said, I have few comments to make based on this testimonial and taking it as a truth word by word despite Breitbart being a source of pretty disgraceful editorials, headlines, and articles over the years.\n\nIn her testimonial, Juanita is talking about Bill Clinton assaulting her and then she points out that Hillary approached her and told her \"I just want to thank you for everything you're doing in bill's campaign, and it's so nice to meet you\" and then for no apparent reason Hillary decided to go from nice to crazy (which I don't quite understand from a pure logic point of view)  and said \"Do you understand everything you do?\" and from that sentence alone, Juanita assumed Hillary meant all the following things without any evidence at all:\n\n1) Hillary supposedly knew Bill raped her\n\n2) If Hillary supposedly knew, who told her? Bill? really? why?\n\n3) She also assumed Hillary was intimidating her in particular, yet she is not making a single statement that justifies such conclusion.\n\n4) Juanita is scared of Hillary Clinton becoming president because Bill raped her and cheated on Hillary... how exactly does this angle make sense? Hillary was cheated on, she was in the public eye, exposed as the wife of a cheating husband accused of rape.\n\n5) Without hard evidence (I'm afraid there was no evidence in this case as opposed to Monica L. and some others) why should Hillary stand by you as a victim of a rape that was never proved? \n\n6) Yes, a victim of a rape should always be heard, believed and supported by giving them the opportunity to prove her case, which didn't happen in this case.\n\n7) ANYONE in their right mind will try to discredit a case against someone you firmly believe to be innocent, why wouldn't you? you're literally asking Hillary to take your word for her husband's without any concrete evidence in a moment of extreme pain for her, so you're also focusing your attention on Hillary, who is also a different kind of victim in this whole story, rather than pushing your case forward against Bill until you see justice for your case.\n\n8) You've openly supported Trump even after the release of a 2005 video in which he literally describes trying to assault a married woman... so I have a very hard time understanding why a victim of rape will accept such behavior when it comes from Trump towards other women... This would officially be the first time in my life I see a victim of sexual assault support another sex predator rather than standing by women in similar situations... especially when you could easily support Jill Stein, Gary Johnson or simply retract from voting because you are disgusted by all candidates.\n\nPlease help me believe you and stand by you... \n\nPS: If you're a Trump supporter reading this and are already thinking about any insulting thing to reply as you so often do with everyone with different opinions, I urge you to save your time and energy, I'm not planning on engaging in meaningless political discussions, I am not a Clinton supporter, I am not a Trump supporter, I wanted Bernie for president and he's not running any longer so I am not trying to convince anyone to vote for or against anyone.\n\nHave a great day",

Trump has had dozens of allegations of sexual assault against him and has been accused of raping a 13 yo. However, Breitbart has been silent on those allegations. I am not saying Donald Trump or Bill Clinton are innocent, nor am I saying they are guilty. The evidence against both men is too miniscule to make a proper judgement. Though, with so many allegation against both men, some are likely true. However, at least be fair with your coverage. Also, if you are going to report on this story give all the information. Juanita Broderick isn't the most reliable source of information; she changed her story of how she was raped multiple times ,and at one point recanted her claims against Bill. Juanita's story could be true, but the only evidence we have are her allegations, which were ever shifting.",

It might have been said already, but I'll say it this time.\n\nThis is not about who's running or who raped who. We know Bill isn't running, and we know that Hillary isn't the rapist. This is about morality and honesty.\n\nMillions of dollars have been given to Clinton by women's rights activists and feminists. \n\nLike in the pic I posted, she tweets and claims that victims of sexual assault and rape should be believed and supported.\n\nAnd now we have a woman who says that Bill raped her and Hillary enabled him to.\n\nAll Trump needs to do is acknowledge this at the debate.\n\nHow is Clinton going to defend this in the debate? If she denies the allegation (or any single part of it), she'll make herself look like a hypocrite and feminists won't like the denial. If she admits to it, she and her husband are disgusting. If she (with the help of Anderson Cooper) avoid the question, it won't make her look good on stage. How will she get out of this?\n\nThis is one of the things that I like about Trump. He can say dumb shit and his morals can be in question, but if there's one thing good you can say about the Don, it's that he can use his enemies words and actions against them. And that's genius.",

Now, her lip was almost bit off! She's crying about this in 2016 at 1:38, but not 1999? He \"did it again\" in 2016, LMAO!!!! Clinton got sunglasses in 2016. She developed a nearly broken left clavicle in 2016. The friend she had in 1999 has disappeared in 2016.\nRegarding Hillary Clinton \"knowing her husband raped her: I'm calling bullshit. Hillary Clinton suspecting Billy cheated with her is far more plausible, assuming the event happened. \n Ms Clinton was correct in removing the statement that a rape victim has the right to be believed. Too often, police have blown off a rape victim's story, which is wrong. \nSo what Ms Broaddrick received from me was listening to her stories of 1999 and 2016. At best, it's not credible against Bill Clinton and irrelevant in voting for Hillary Clinton.\nNo wonder you fucking scumbag shit for brains Breitbart maggots got me banned from your shitty assed safe space, which is really a place where you guys suck each other off.",

    "commentText": "TRUTH.  Juanita's account:  In 1978, Bill Clinton was accused of raping Juanita Broaddrick in Little Rock, Arkansas:\nIn a famous interview aired on NBC‚Äôs Nightline in 1999, shortly after Bill Clinton was cleared by the Senate of impeachment, Juanita recalled:\n‚ÄúThen he tries to kiss me again. And the second time he tries to kiss me he starts biting my lip. ‚Ä¶ He starts to, um, bite on my top lip and I tried to pull away from him. And then he forces me down on the bed. And I just was very frightened, and I tried to get away from him and I told him ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù that I didn‚Äôt want this to happen, but he wouldn‚Äôt listen to me. ‚Ä¶ It was a real panicky, panicky situation. I was even to the point where I was getting very noisy, you know, yelling to ‚ÄúPlease stop.‚Äù And that‚Äôs when he pressed down on my right shoulder and he would bite my lip. ‚Ä¶ When everything was over with, he got up and straightened himself, and I was crying at the moment, and he walks to the door and calmly puts on his sunglasses. And before he goes out the door he says, ‚ÄúYou better get some ice on that.‚Äù And he turned and went out the door.‚Äù\nThe Washington Post reported that the White House released a statement in 1999 denying the allegations, ‚ÄúAny allegation that the president assaulted Ms. Broaddrick more than 20 years ago is absolutely false,‚Äù Clinton‚Äôs personal attorney, David E. Kendall, said in a statement released by the White House yesterday.‚Äù Beyond that we are not going to comment.‚Äù\nBroaddrick claims that Hillary confronted her shortly after the incident. At a fundraiser she said, ‚ÄúI just want you to know how much Bill and I appreciate the things you do for him. Do you understand? Everything [emphasis added] you do,‚Äù conveying a not so subtle threat.\nOn the encounter, Broaddrick says ‚Äúwhat really went through my mind at that time is ‚ÄòShe knows. She knew. She‚Äôs covering it up and she expects me to do the very same thing.'‚Äù",

Here you have a woman making a similar claim but with the story attached, yet the same people who jump on the trial by media bandwagon will overlook this to vote for a megalomaniacal psychopath. Yeah I know Trump is a dumpster fire cuntbag, but he's not a corrupt status-quo politician no matter which way you slice it. Better to break the status-quo now to prevent hurt down the road. The Clintons need to be in prison not the White House. And this is coming from a guy who still hated Trump and mercilessly attacked him while simultaneously supporting Hillary, at least I did until I actually had an understanding of the situation. Don't get me wrong I still hate the cunt, but for the sake of humanity, freedom and justice. Vote Trump.",

It just kind of strikes me as bizarre \nthat Broaddrick would forgo testifying in the Lewinsky case, which would\n be a prime opportunity to get Bill to face some justice, and instead \nfocus on destroying his wife‚Äôs career, decades later.
