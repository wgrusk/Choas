Will Trump and McCullen then resign in abject disgrace? Yeah, right! \n\nThe on-going SCOTUS debacle originated in 2016 when McConnell blocked Obama's constitutional right to nominate for the vacant SCOTUS position. That disgraceful situation deteriorated until we now have Justice Kavanaugh, who may soon be declared by his peers to be unfit even to be a Judge. This is all down to the corrupt McConnell, who is unfit even to be a Senator!",

    "commentText": "Putin's Asymmetric Assault on Democracy in Russia and Europe: Implications for US National Security - A Minority Staff Report Prepared for the use of the Committee on Foreign Relations - US Senate, 115th Congress, 2nd Session, January 10, 2018\n\nWhile consolidating his grip on power at home, Mr. Putin oversaw an opportunistic expansion of malign influence operations abroad, targeting vulnerable states on Russia‚Äôs periphery, as well as countries in Western institutions like the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The Kremlin has substantially increased its investments in propaganda outlets beyond Russia‚Äôs borders, funded and supported nongovernmental organizations and political parties that advanced Mr. Putin‚Äôs antiEU and anti-NATO agenda, nationalized mafia groups to help launder money and commit other crimes for the state abroad, and used its near-monopoly over energy supplies in some countries to exert influence and spread corruption.\n\nIn semi-consolidated democracies and transitional governments on Russia‚Äôs periphery, the Kremlin most aggressively targets states that seek to integrate with the EU and NATO or present an opportunity to weaken those institutions from within. For example, as Georgia and Ukraine moved closer to these institutions, the Russian government attacked them with cyberwarfare, disinformation campaigns, and military force. When the Kremlin‚Äôs attempt to politically influence Montenegro‚Äôs election failed, its security services allegedly tried to launch a coup. In Serbia, the Kremlin exploits cultural connections and leverages its near monopoly on energy supplies to attempt to slow down or derail the country‚Äôs Western integration efforts. And though they are in the EU and NATO, countries like Hungary and Bulgaria face acute challenges from the Russian government, which exerts significant influence in politics, business, and the energy sector. Despite some efforts to counter Russian malign influence, these countries remain significantly vulnerable to the Kremlin‚Äôs corrupt agenda.\n\nIn consolidated democracies within the EU and NATO, the Russian government seeks to undermine support for sanctions against Russia, interfere in elections through overt or covert support of sympathetic political parties and the spread of disinformation, and sow discord and confusion by exacerbating existing social and political divisions through disinformation and cultivated ideological groups. This group of countries has developed several effective countermeasures that both deter Russian government behavior and build societal resilience. As it crafts its response, the United States should look to these lessons learned:\n\nThe United Kingdom has made a point to publicly chastise the Russian government for its meddling in democracies, and moved to strengthen cybersecurity and electoral processes.\n\nGermany pre-empted Kremlin interference in its national election with a strong warning of consequences, an agreement among political parties not to use bots or paid trolls, and close cyber cooperation between the government and political campaigns.\n\nSpain has led Europe in cracking down on Russia-based organized crime groups that use the country as an operational base and node for money laundering and other crimes.\n\nFrance has fostered strong cooperation between government, political, and media actors to blunt the impact of the Kremlin‚Äôs cyber-hacking and smear campaigns.\n\nThe Nordic states have largely adopted a ‚Äò‚Äòwhole of society‚Äô‚Äô approach against Mr. Putin‚Äôs malign influence operations, involving the government, civil society, the media, and the private sector, with an emphasis on teaching critical thinking and media literacy.\n\nThe Baltic states have kept their publics well-informed of the malicious activities of Russia‚Äôs security services, strengthened defenses against cyberattacks and disinformation, and diversified energy supplies to reduce dependence on Russia.",
