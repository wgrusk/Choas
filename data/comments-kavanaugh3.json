I remember posting this on YouTube and being attacked, but that did not stop me. When the campaigning started, I worked his campaign and loved every minute of it.  I noticed right off that, then, Candidate Trump, was THE only candidate with a vision for our country. Other candidates not only were not equipped with a vision, when asked, not one of them had a good response about what they would do for the country. Not so with Candidate Trump. He would give a healthy litany with specifics of how he would \"Make America Great Again.\" Now, it is fun to see what new thing President Trump has done to \"Make Anerica Great Again,\" such as his recent modification or enhancement of NAFTA. I love to follow his accomplishments because I know I will be working his campaign again. \nNow, this evening folks, I am concerned. I see on YouTube where the Clinton's are going on a speaking tour across the country. I think how depraved and demented this is. How in Gods name can they be allowed to do this thing. Are they not, at minimum, a pair of serial killers? I think of the damages done during President Trump's campaign - the lies told etc. They should both be banned from ever serving in office again, or from being at all involved in politics. I encourage watching two videos on YouTube, then tell us your thoughts. Spread the word:\nVideo #1: \"The Clinton Chronicles. \"\nVideo #2: \" Twelve Clinton Whistleblowers Found Hanging from Doorknobs.\" (Incidentally, Robin Williams was one of the twelve)[This is a MUST see]",
