what surprised you most with this change my mind and what arguments do you most often hear against the wall
does he actually believe on all these topics hes talked about im confused
a lot of the hispanic population i know do not believe on paying taxes if they became us citizens they would still ignore the tax rule id every hispanic you come across  and look for any unpaid traffic tickets or violations and kicks them out we will still have a lot of illegal immigrants but the numbers would stay low sorry my people most hispanic education on the laws and regulations of the states are a piece of ignorance the situation
pineapples should not be on pizzachange my mind
its funny how u always interview the biggest degenerates
the wall really needs to be built on mexicos southern border
please steven make a part two because i dont think these people you interviewed were mentally fit to give a simple opinion
i wish leeroy didnt show up to this argument
leroy for governor 
im a big fan of this channel like mr crowder but the guy from new mexico won this or was right in this convo he couldnt put his words right but we get the idea the border will cost too much money too make
i like youre videos and agree with some points you make but not all i would have loved to sit in that chair for this one
leroy out here making the rest of us brown folk look bad smh
building a wall will substantially decrease the number of poverished illegal immigrants who come to us to contribute as well somewhat decreasing some of the people walking drugs across the border but cartels or properly funded drug dealers will be generally unphased by any kind of wallremember when trump said maybe a ropelol there are many ways to get overunderaround a wall so fine build the wall just dont forget to fix the immigration system in general especially the court system which is terribly under funded
seriously  didnt germany  have a wall to separate the west and east
build the wall i like walls
to be honest that guy scares the hell out of me he has more serious  issues than a simple wall chipping people  like animals lol sounds more  totalitarian than a wall
scientifical  not the future governor of new mexico
scientifical
204 i have family all the time in canada lol
honestly left wing people why do you act so ignorant  i really dont get why they are such sheep   they should all tape their mouths shut and take a look in the mirror 
okay wtf leroy
i wish we could open a hole in the fabric of reality look into another dimension and see what would happen if they have their way if we had open borders and everything else they wanted
trump 2020
i cant wait for the new spanish governor of new mexico to start microchipping people and to build his xray border
how the hell are you gonna make illegal immigrants pay taxes and wear id when you dont know if theyre coming into your country thats what makes illegal immigrants different from legal immigrants
that man is a crack head
that dude wanted an xray gate but no wall how exactly do you have a gate without a wall
why does he put an uh at the end of so many wordsuh 
did we all just forget he said scientifical
it would be very expensive and the immigrants would just get a ladder and climb over it
i agree with some points steven but i wouldve liked to be there i think i couldve possibly changed your mind
i like seeing civilized conversations whether people agree or not
does anyone ever change your mind lmao
man that dude is hella mexican you can hear it in his accent
so have them go through a xray gate  sounds good  so we probably need to put somethign around this gate to ensure they go through the gate  i dunno something like a wall
steven id like to see the data that indicates that 3  5 of the population the illegal population commits 13 of violent crimeaccording to statistics on the federal bureau of prisons website we can deduce that in a worst case scenario 15 of the inmates noncitizen inmates in federal prisons committed 5 of the murders kidnappings and aggravated robberies obviously this figure can be expected to change when we start to account to for the individual states but i havent seen data that reflects the figure you gave leroy
checkered vans
a lot of people hate trump and his wall but he still won what
what surprises me the most is the assertion that immigrants andor latinos are have a higher crime rate the ucr would disagree with that assertion wwwfbigov  path servicescriminal justice information servicesucr2017 crime in the united statespersons arrested arrest tablesexpanded arrest datarace and ethnicity according to these tables white people seem to be the ones with more arrests on record yes latinos are according to the us census bureau considered white but look at the hispanic or latinonot hispanic or latino it still shows a vast higher level of criminal disparity among nonhispanic whites after this many would argue percentages theres a number that continues to be made public 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the shadows if that number is true there is an even higher disparity percentage wise in the number of white nonhispanic or latinos than there is in white hispanic or latinos
another example of how the educational system is failing in the us
let me preface this by saying i support crowders opinion on the matter but i can really respect the way the guy in the white shirt conducted himself he had an actual conversation rather than yelling insults and stuff while his proposed methods might not be plausible he was respectful in his conversation more people like this need to converse on the show im not sure how he behaved off camera but from whats shown props
illegal immigrants will still come here legally on a plane and just overstay their visas and the wall will trap them here
anybody else get a build the wall ad
maybe try and change people to stop doing drugs and there wont be so much drug trafficking but then again there wont be no money made for the system so then again it wont stop until we the people stop
do you really want the wall
the wall would be useless theyd go to canada where we just let anyone in and come to america through there
wtf is wrong with that guy from new mexico he talks fucking weird he adds an a at the end of almost every word
build the x ray gate 
the statistic that steven quotes around 640 in the video is completely false no where on the internet is there a source that backs up the claim that 35 of the population illegal immigrants commit 37 of the homicides in the united states first of all just logically thinking about what is most likely that is asinine the fact that steven touts this absurdly false statistic is misleading and gross and invalidates this entire video
napalm all of them
thank you for being a real person amidst all tbis shit the work you do is important more so than you know
do more change my mind videos
the truth of the matter is there are many closeted racists in this country thats why no one wanted to sit down they dont have a counter argument because they dont want or need one as long as people pretend to care about other groups of people then they  save face this is coming from a  black contractor who gets followed through neighborhoods despite clearly working did i mention people grip their purses or cross the street due to my 56 presence alone
new mexico since 1550  it didnt become a state until 1917
i got a better solution  kill them all
the first guy genuinely annoys me
lol aw that poor kid he thinks hes gonna be governor 
holy shit mexican guy is basically advocating no borders but instead gps tracking everybody at all times to see where theyre at
most stupid phrase i heard today mexican  american
forget the wall lets pull out of these countries and strengthen are borders with are military thats the only way to effectively doing
i hear pogo boy and the bear in the background wow
how were you not laughing your ass off about the xray borders haha
the second very out of breath man just described basically invisibly microchip tracking immigrants without there consent forcing them through field of radioactive waves often and having the ever so kind police force do sweeps of cities to monitor the movements of said immigrants trump would be proud
how can he be for the wall if clearly statistics show the immigration is bringing innovation and jobs for al of us and not crime
stevencrowder is just a typical american citizen with obviously no global awareness change my mind not in correspondence to just this video
is not necessary to build a wall
love the channel dont agree with your views but love your open talks
build the wall  deport them all 
the ignorance is real
scientifical
you probably shouldnt have showed that first lady she didnt really say anything useful that the public needed to see and if she rolls with the kind of people that she says and they see this shes fucked if they personally knew her and got deported or arrested shes in legitimate danger
a wall wont change anything tbh beside build an obstacle for an immigrant to get in you can go under a wall knowing how low you have to dig or fly over with a visa or go over sea on a tour to the us the people he interviewd are stupid
im a mexican and the only issue i have with the wall is the environmental issues that it can cause like dividing territories of animals and messing with their ecosystems
no offense but perhaps filter some of these people
506 the boy has the face of an aztec peasant spanish my ass
leroy is a fucking moron thats cleara  you knowa whata i meana
crowder this lady might get attacked by the dudes
1046 sounds like he is just hinting at building a high tech wall lol
why would you want to actually build a physical wall you know how much that shit would cost and how impractical that would be im australian so i dont really care about your immigration problem im just saying actually building a wall is the stupidest thing ive heard of
do liberals are retarded change my mind
lets start deporting all the illegal aliens  europeans who traveled a ocean to get here and kill  murder  rape  enslave  all the native civilization that where here  they are the ones who need to be deported back to europe across that ocean  lets not forget they used jesus christ to justify millions of human murdered 
wow new mexico youre fucked if this guy wins
yea but the wall wont fix literally a thing
its not gonna stop them so why build it so that a bunch if people cam make money
this non mexican spaniard 
i dont think its fair to say this guy is stupid but it just goes to show that the majority of people do not research and investigate the actual data and criteria with certain propositions and ideas to help the united states majority of people get defensive and then let personal ego blurt out any nonsense that in their minds make them feel right
im also a latin but i hate seeing some latins talking shit or talking when they do not know anything and make the rest of latinos as ignorants
the fucked up part is that they blur her face but not her id 
i agreed so far with him on all the topics but this one no
i dont agree with you on this
please blur her id tag
if i saw him with this i would tell him build the wall hell yeah trump
whats the ecological cost of something like that how much natural resource do we have left why are we not addressing garbage in the pacific ocean that has formed a texas sized pile why we are not implementing alternative energy resources maybe just maybe clear up the debris that orbits the earth and maybe destroy some dams while were at it mother nature gets mad and says fuck you to us from time to time ask any earthquake or volcano or tornado or tsunami or hurricanes and if were not careful a nuclear haloucastmisspelled my point is lets stop being so decisive and lets save ourselves together because the record shows mother nature undefeated and o humanity barely hanging on
that dude with the back pack is spun out
i deadass got a trump add telling us to build a wall
this doesnt prove shit honestly i woudve just fuck this nigga up and had him post it up for the views fucking lame ass fool
here u guys are all supporting this steven guy and calling out the people he interviewed but he came well prepared and did research before setting up the table meanwhile these people from the streets have to be put on the spot yet be expected by you guys to give statistics fair and square aint it
this just proves there are uneducated people on both sides
bruh i was hoping id see smarter people discuss
when can you come to arizona i know multiple people that would love to have a sit down conversation with you that are not only adults but also the youth of our nation aging from 8th to 12th grade
an xray border is not a strong argument 
i got a build a wall ad tryna watch this lmaoo
probably the scariest thing ive ever heard
leroy needs to lay off the netflix
pause then go to 059 they didnt block her face entirely
im not mexican im spanish my family has been living there since 1550
just my opinion i know some of this can take years and too good to be true  dont build the wall save the money for us debt use money for more investigations raids and deport immigrants with criminal records illegally not the ones going to college and working for their families with clean record but make them pay and finish courses to become a resident atleastuse money to beef up security on borders stop saying mexico is paying for the wall make it harder to get us work visa or citizenship use money for more background checks etc 
why the fuck would u build the wall
i believe that people should be free to live and work wherever they want in the world we all leave on earth and we all were randomly born in a certain location on earth i dont see how im bound to the same location for all my life and this vise versa to everyone i believe that borders are a status que that hard to change because thats what people are grown into but if we were born to a society without borders i think that nobody whould agree to implement borders in any way we can build a fence around our house for protection but why whould i build a fence around such a large piece of land if usa portraits itself as the greatest nation on earth then people from 3rd world countries will always will try to immigrate to the best possible situation for themselves and i think they should cause thats what will create balance to our society wich is the entire earth population as a society we are as strong as our weakest link thus the strong should lift the weak and not put it down most of the people in the world are poor just imagine how they could benefit our society wit the right platform and tools and im not saying that usa should support the entire world but i wish that more strong countries will try lift the weak and put there money to that instead of creating destructive tools and building giant walls
the wall is dumb illegal immigration is at an all time low theyll go under the wall over the wall planes boats its just a huge waste of  for those who think it will stop drugs those will just come in through canada
okso when one says a wall are we saying all sides nsew because the focus is mainly one in the south
that guy was just rambling on and on 
good lord that guy was not the brightest
that second guy needs to watch psychopassfreaking frightening
pineapple should be on pizza change my mind
i swear some people are incapable of higher thinking
build a dome if you want just stop saying that mexico has to pay for your follies
im not for a wallbut lets have something worse a wall with a xray gatelol
but donald trump did say the majority are rapists and murderers 
trumps wall xray gate 
leroy on that good good
leroy said boss hogs instead of boss dogs lmao silly ass lil tortilla mexico
oh my goodness god please watch over new mexico because if this guy becomes governor theyre in trouble
wow that guy from nm lives in a delusion and he wants to be governor
so does steven actually agree with building the wall
15 years and 30 billion dollars of tax payer money later untill that wall is up
lets just build an enormous xray scanner across the whole us border and microchip everyone who comes across
omg that spanish guy was so retarded
this guy reworded what border patrol already does threw in electronic tagging and presented it like he discovered the answer of all answers
im not mexican im spanishyeaaaaand my dick is 15 inches long
here are my statementspeople should come into the country legallyif people come illegalydeport themand if they have children in americadeport them toosee mexican nationality law at httpsenmwikipediaorgwikimexicannationalitylaw crime should be punisheddone by a legal or illegal immigrant according to the us lawwe should work to legallize the illegals that are productive to communities and without crime recordsbuild an electric fencenot a wall
spanish guy watches too much blade runner
he looked mad at the end
both people seemed to really support the idea of controlling the borders but a wall is badbecause the media says it is mean
im not the best with public speaking but this was hard to watch not because of steven tho
we already have a high rate of poverty amongst american citizens and this dude  810 is saying make those illegal immigrants legal citizens and tax them make everything easy for them instead of fixing our own problems problems we already have
dude is payed to stir shit up i clear to me now steven coward is sold and payed for like a ho
well i heard most fly in
when you say mexico is not sending us their best they are sending us people with problems they are bring drugs they are bringing crime they are rapists and some i assume are good people that insinuates that most mexicans that come here are criminalsif we want to be so tough on immigration lets kick out every person who is not at least 51 native american let them create their own immigration laws and see if they let us back in
lol the look you gave at the end was me throughout this entire video
that guys on cocaine or has anxiety
the masterminds have had a idea build a wall
building a wall will cost americans billionsand a ladder cost mexico 50 pesos  money well spent lol 
this is like telling a doctor who beat up a patient that its the patients fault he is injuried and doesnt deserve to go to the hospital history hegemony and support of dictators in south america by the usa usa should be lenient on immigration due to owing reparations
that guy is kind of dumb i wish i was able to argue with steve bc i would probably win lol
the wall is kind of irrelevant due to the holes and air travel
this is confusingthis woman is confusing criminal law with immigration lawif every person was sent back to their country of origin due to crimes committed  north america would only have native americanswhich would include mexicans
the wall will be useless it will be a huge waste of money there is more ways to get into america plus building that wall will make the cartels stronger drugs may be a bit harder to smuggle but when they do get their drug package through it will be more expensive and since drug will be more expensive then those people who are hooked and cant afford it then they will get desperate and do what they need to do to get their fix meaning more crime
becoming your own sponsor thats a new one 
against the wall because its ineffective border patrol wants sizemic and thermal sensors with more agents
i think that building a wall is a waste of money i also think we should try to find a way to keep illegal immigrants out if the us but there has to be a cheaper way
that guy leroy is by far the most ignorant being i have ever seen on your videos i am spanish my family has been in new mexico definitely not mexican please classify him as anything but mexican
1034 lets just build a hiant xray scanner instead of a wall
im sorry to say this but i believe the homie leroy was stoned asf at this moment
steven crowder for president
xray chip servile and over taxholy shit just build the fucking wall
watching this guy talk killed my braincells
this guy is so stupid im sorry im a latina america citizen but this guy talking to steven wants everyone get a easy way with citizenship they need a wall to stop this criminals for coming here to stop bringing drugs to stop the human trafficking coming from mexico trump put that wall soon we having and my state mexican trying to kidnap women with childrens and walmart so is and others store they are all looking mexican doing this kidnaping
just tax them and the us gets the revenue than the us can use that revenue to pay for them and their kids
stevencrowder where do you get your statistics genuinely curious not sarcastically asking do you have a link 
i would have love to be there and changed ur mind bc ive changed many peoples mind on the border and their view on immigrants and how they have identified them to be
the wall is just a terrible waste of tax dollars
how many illegal canadians are in the country
whos is going to pay for it 
this guy was high
i really dont have a dog in this fight at all  however i would rather we take that border wall money and spend it on upgrading the us infrastructure for better bridges roads and electrical grid   my view point is that the wall doesnt harm anyone so why not build it but im good either way i dont agree with trump on making mexico pay for a wall the us wants however
i think that illegal immigrants that commit crimes should be deported but i think that illegal immigrants that contribute to the economy should be given a chance at citizenship i also think citizenship should be made simpler for people from mexico so theyre more likely to get it in the first place in the end wall or not most illegal immigrants get to the united states on a plane
soooare these people just going to ignore the fact that human trafficking is perhaps one of the biggest problems affecting mexico and a lot of it has to do with the lack of border patrol between mexico and the usa border wall will definitely help deter the problembut alone it wont stop it completely if nothing is done then in a couple of years when the new president of mexico fucks up the place due to socialist policiesthen even liberals will ask for a border wall
the zoom in to his face at then end  hes like wtf did i just listen to 
this is the biggest l ive ever felt as a latino
2nd guy is being illogical lol
that guy in the end is retared
that guy is a fuking moron lol xray gate hahahaha
i wish i could encounter this guy  i would love to talk about this topic  lol plus the spanish wanna be guy sounded dumb stupid 
as a conservative i think building a wall is a stupid idea these coyotes bringing in these illegals are not hopping fences theyre crossing tunnels plus it has an obnoxious price tag we could use those funds for something else
come on man this is like challenging a mentally handicapped kid to a fist fight  pick someone that actually has something logical or intelligent to say  theyre out there somewherefeels like the real agenda of this show is to show how stupid a lot of people are out there  you dont really want anyone to change your mind if you did i expect you would choose more formidable adversaries
michael scott for governor
that dude was high af on coke and adderall lol
im not mexican im spanish oh papi dont lie
omg is anybody else having like a nailsonchalkboard moment everytime this guy holding the gopro on himself ends words that end in a vowel with an extra uh syllable at the end of them
fix mexicos corrupt government why is the greatest country on earth next to people who are suffering
change your mind   easy   very first thing that popped into my mind was so what is supposed to happen to all the millions of animals that routinely cross the border all the time as part of their usual migration patterns in those area while feeding migrating etcyeah sure ok theyll adapt over time or die as im sure they did after the great wall of china occurredin concept i like the idea of the wall but in reality it seems like a huge ill thoughtout idea  what kind of illthought out consequences would their be for the wildlife directly confronted with this new obstacle  has anybody studied or documented what effect the great wall of china had on the animals stuck on one side or the other of it  how long it took for affected species to adaptalso being a native californian unfortunately i realize that our economy demands that we have cheap exploitable labor at our disposal its just the way it is  to make things fair something ive often suggested is the following make it so that a child born in the us is not automatically considered a citizen unless at least one of its parents is a natural born or legally naturalized citizen of the us thats it thats all youd have to doim tired as hell of having these folks rush to make it past the finish line of the border just so their kids can be born here and have my tax dollars spent on their education public education and their healthcare feds allowing hospitals to writeoff a bunch of the fees that wont be paid by low income immigrants who do you think pays for that we do etcand then ya gotta imagine like in a movie scene where the lead guy of this wall project is all leaning back on it arms crossed feeling proud and admiring his work when all of a sudden maybe 100 yards away from him he starts to hear a sound then something starts burrowing up out of the soil just on this side of the wall he looks over and its a set of human hands
its amazing the level of ignorance by the average person in this country  they truly are unaware of what is true and what is propaganda  who is to blame the mainstream media and willfully bliss who absorb what they are being told and parrot what they are told
he probably meant not so much a xray but a scanner to identify an identity chipif we were to use identity chips then the country could put these scanners literally everywhere and always know where you are its not a very free system for people also this idea sounds like border security the very thing he said we shouldnt have
bro youre mexican stfu
this dude is living in 2035
we are in 2018 while this guy is in 2091
dont build a wall just take away every humans freedoms and put an electronic chip in them and radioactively scan them when they cross the border lol heck just scan at state county and city borders too people legit scare me
land mines would way more cheaper and effective
so hes not mexican but his family was there since 1550 
we tag sharks and other animals to track migration put a tracker on people who come here illegaly before we put them back that way we know when they try to come back you get your tracker removed when you earn legal status
im a cheap prick
bhat who is salling the drugses good point
my family is immigrants and i still support enforcing our borders im all for immigrants coming to the us but i am 100 against illegal immigration into the us come legally or dont come at all
the new mexican is on some good shitanyway although this wasnt much of a debate i am definitely against the wall i can think of a million better ways to spend the money every other developed country can manage their immigration without a physical wall
yup  this problem requires a m a s t e r m i n d
the spanish dude has the right mind but wrong ideas he had no idea to explain himself
electronic id tag 
if the united states made it easier for people to immigrate legally they wouldnt have so many problems with illegal immigration same as with drivers licence as soon as they oppened the oppertunity for all most people obtained it now for those who didnt it is easy to tell they have problems with the law
i dont support illegal immigration but building a wall is nothing but a waste of tax dollars it wont fix the issue theyll still find a way into the country id be surprised if it even slowed down the rate at which they enter
i like a lot of ur change my mind  but not this one
hahah did anyone notice the lady has a plant in her drink
im confused do they actually believe these things like do they actually support the wall
an xray boarder yeah kids dont do drugs or you too will have idioc ideas you think are brilliant
you need a wall for that x ray sensor
ive seen this first hand also criminals dont get deported while nice hard working  ilegal  immigrants get deported all the time ive seen ilegal people getting pregnant just to have a card to stay in this country the amount of shit ive seen just make me want to vomit build the wall deport all criminals and tax the money that leaves the country i want my children to live in a nice country not being hit and run by some drunk illegal alien that doesnt have any remorse for killing people while intoxicated all nice immigrants should be welcome just kick the bad ones the system is broken  please allow trump to fix it
buid a wall with your ass
can someone tell me which statistics crowder is referring too about illegal immigrants committing more crime than natural citizens i am trying to find it for a citation i am doing but having no luck
waste of money ladders diggingdrones and etc
a physical wall does not stop people from entering
they need to build the damn wallits so damn hard to find a damn job bc all the mexicans got the hoes
fuck that shit they need to stay the ass in mexico if that where the need to be at
if mexico were nigeria the us will need not just a wall but a moat and archers  gonna be some world war z  at the boarders everyday
if we build a wall on the mexicous border then we should do the same up north on the canadianus border
dude at 1000 is a moron
x ray lol please deport that guy
this guy gives me a headache
go green global has 5 subs and 1 video
1316 that face though 
is that dude on meth or some shit
shouldve changed her voice bro
sure it makes perfectly sense to build a checkspot without walls to the sides sure all the people will pass through there
put some socks on
you could tell homie is from nm haha
no offense but i hope that 2nd guy never becomes governor of nm
yall gotta leave leroy alone sure an xray border aint the greatest idea but as crowder said he was on the spot he still made a couple good points though
omg the guy from new mexico makes me cringe i know people like that  that talk out their assssssssssss
lol what the hell was leroy talking about was that moron high
leeroy is definitely tweaking
that spanish guy was smart
just because you are a republican doesnt mean you have to support that wall
652 is that an r32
the mexican dude sound retarded af
a wall is a waste of money we already waste too much taxpayer money and conservatives are supposed to be about small government
the guy that sat down is a fucking retard talm bout a fucking xray scanner wtf
haha i get it the only topic you wont really all you wont talk about seriously lol
that guy was a clown
drugsuh
the drugza
no borders no standards hence the second one interviewed
im not mexican im spanish lol
build a wall that shoots frickin laser beams
whos that skinny chick in the back shes hot as fuck
why do u talk to the biggest idiots  hurts my brain listening to these fucks
the first guy has his own show 
this guy leroy might be one of the dumbest fucks ive ever listened to
leroy is smoking some hell of a crack
scientifical 
1050this man is talking about idiocracy the movie when every one hasneeds a barcode to live lol
the wall is pointless  they already have tunnels  if you want to waste taxpayers money go ahead  i say unmanned aerial drones with non lethal ammo would work way better more cost effective less need for border patrol agents as they wouldnt need to patrol rather go out to calls from the drone pilot
chicanos are stupid asf mexicans come in a variety the ones born here are the lazy fucks the paisas are the hard working ones out of all fuken mexican people a dumb ass chicana lady had to sit and speak for mexicans fuk were fked
lol
i dont like the idea of a wall but hear me out on this one we could build a giant xray scanner along the border and track immigrants in real time wherever they are so we can tax them what kind of drugs do they got down south i need them
im spanish im from new mexico since like 1550s wut
when that spaniard talked about borders are going to be a thing of the past i dont think he gets how reality works what a stupid statement all throughout history there has always been struggle for power to grab land look at china they dont own south china sea yet theyre trying to claim it by making islands out there theres a reason why we dont have many wars today is because we already claimed all the land that has to be claimed on earth i would one hundred percent agree on an idea if that there was more land on earth that needed to be conquered there would be more wars wait till we get to mars and if we do terraform it just watch there will be conflict on grabbing up land
man everybody knows building the wall is just a political statement why even bother pouring billions of dollars towards the construction of something that will not even work illegal immigrants crossing the border will not see the wall and just turn back and give up these people come all the way from central america and beyond a wall aint gonna do shit this was just a stunt from donald trump to gain more votes but people like this guy take it too seriously
im not even going to lie steven i was opposed to the wall before clicking on this video but i must say this video kind of made me more open minded to the idea it makes more sense now appreciate these types of videos brother they allow me to open my eyes and take in new perspectives keep up the good work
60 percent of illegal immagrints are from asia guess we got to build a wall around the whole goddam country
spanish not native american lol
1550s yeah right what a dumbass
i can prove they arent buildings a wall to keep people out
hes not mexican but his family has been in mexico since the 1500s dude sounded like a moron every time he opened his mouth
im interested in the science of that xray border scanner
1141 wow this guy has come up with a ton of great ideas in only three years that hes been thinking about it he should definitely be governor holy shit its scary how delusional people are
this guy is just going places
as a mexican in my opinion the discussion with this thing is overrated there is already a wall and we mexicans dont complain about it although my feeling with american immigrant policy is what you would expect americans are too extremist and protectionist mostly republicans taking for example that i lived in germany for one year abroad for high school and i never struggled nor in the airport neither with police because of being a foreigner in comparison when i travel to the us when i want to cross the border to go to san antonio police make an interrogative session just because i want to go to the riverwalk to buy some clothes
i hate how people choose to believe something is bad with no actual reason lol
this is the only one that i disagree with so far man
why did none of them talk about the cost of the wall that is the only argument against it
i live in las cruces new mexico we are doomed if this guy gets elected governor             scientifical xray boarder
as a mexican american i dont care if you wanna build a wall just know thats your tax money going to waste
we should like micro chip them and track them when going through the border and write an essay on why you are passing the boarder he didnt say that but this man would probably say that
everyone wants a wall just not physical one 
damnit leroy
i dont think ive ever heard anything like leeroys idea before i dont agree with the idea in general but it suprises me that theres more options being brought to the table its not often you see new ideas like this im still pro wall though 
lets turn the us in to giant walled castle and put signs on the wall that read if you werent invited stay out or you will be shot on sight thank you have a nice daythat is after we put firearm education into schools finally because thats the only true guncontrol education seriously not a joke 
i dont think we need a wall we need greater surveillance possibly with drones and hire more boarder patrollers
this video probably got that lady killed
the dude from spain is like talking about stuff from comic books
dont really need a wall just need unlimited open season on illegals crossing the border im sure there are a lot of texas arizona and new mexico residents that would love it and help out
this guy is talking in a circle he just wants open boarders
your intro made me laugh so loud  how do we report those people lmaoo
like crowder is ok pogo and that walther shirt is why im here
your not gonna get a wallget over itd
as if a normal wall wasnt expensive already just make a xray one
holy fuck this guys living in a fantasy world x ray borders
leroy stupid liar he isnt spanish he is obviously mestizo not white italic spain is not his country latino and latin are not the same either hispanic is not the same thing god these people are just uneducated
this mexican guy is why trump wants to build a wall they have enough dumb mother fuckers
nonsense answer why we shouldnt build a wall
taxing immigrants is the most retarded thing ive ever heard
what these people dont understand is that mexico built a wall to keep guatemalans out of there country so why should america do it im all for the wall and they should do it because if they do jobs would go down from all the illegal mexicans coming in
what the fuck is the second guy talking about
so he is actually describing putting a chip in every one as they cross the border it scans the chip  then informs the irs to start following them so they can collect taxes before they hop the border
why the fuck do this dumbfucks sit down and talk about shit they have no idea about
fuck rachel mad cow ad
its funny how the dude at 510 defends mexicans but distances  from them by calling himself spanishhilarious because he obviously is not spanishhe is mexican aztecspanish are europeans and they look european in fact almost 15 of the spanish population has blond or brown hair and light coloured eyeshe does not  the devil is always in details
i hate you for schooling my less intelligent peepz like this lmao 
building a 2000 mile wall is useless and ridiculous im against illegal immigration but a big wall is idiotic and unrealistic
building the wall wont work tell that to the chinese with the great wall of china also how about fences around peoples property now im not saying a wall is 100 effective but it is definitely a deterrent if nothing else its like having a car sitting in a bad area with the keys in it vs a car with the windows closed and locked its much easier to turn someone away with a barrier between them and their goal
its kind of misleading to say that illegal immigrants commit crime at a disproportionate rate to regular citizens and not mention the fact that the crime rate has fallen over that past 30 years while immigration levels have increased taking steven on his word without actually citing the study is the same sort of anecdotal argument he tries to fight against in a lot of other videossource httpswwwnytimescominteractive20180330upshotcrimeimmigrationmythhtml
37 of homicides are not done by undocumented immigrants bullshif
my family are legal immigrants but i was born here and its incredibly heart breaking how hispanics try to come here for a better life but its hard for them to and im so fucking thankful that i was able to be born in this great country but my family came here legally fair and square like i said its heart breaking for the poor familys out of this country who cant provide for there family but you cant illegally come here and not only cost the government trouble but your family
was i the only one who got a headache because of the second guy
is that kid high on coke or something
this one is not good i want to see some triggered people
nearly had a stroke listening to the second conversation
fucking a i can feel my iq dropping with every passing second of listening to this spanish guy what a kumquat
were living in 2018 meanwhile this guys living  in 3048 suggesting having x ray borders 
i think he just show what we want to see if he show all the people who have really good points it wouldnt be so good for the image here we are watching the message from stevencrowder and his opinion is just one face of the coin
that look in the end is priceless lets tax it 
wow i am embarrassed being from new mexico now lmao
the last guy jesus fucking christ think before you speak punkass
422 wait what
it was funny but waste of time listening to someone who can barely speak
yeah why dont usa send out citizenships to everyone in the world no more illegal migrants and the usa tax everyone
well america is very lenient to illegal immigrants which is not something that there is much of in other countries
doesnt support a wall what should we have describes a high tech wall
bruhhh this dude said an xray wall
the lady is probably in some acid barrel by now
xray dude in what world do u live in lol
we need reproductive law imposed immediately for the xray wall dumbass
if you believe a wall is going to stop immigration you better get your facts right that only limits one specific way to get across there are so many illegal ways into the us if anything its just going to cost us more tax money when mexico doesnt pay for it im all for stopping illegal immigration but seriously guys a wall thats a pretty small minded idea i mean its so practical i wouldve put up a firm debate against him on this because im not against the idea of stopping illegal immigration im against the idea of building a useless symbolic wall
that guy has to be on drugs jesus
hello immigrants come through this gate so we can get your id and tax you we dont like bad people coming into the country those with bad intentions please dont just go across the border unnoticed this xray gate is only 3 ft wide in comparison to the 1000mile long border if you go past it oh well nnno fuck they all just went over god damnit if only we had a wall
i agree with the enforcement i just dont think a wall will actually do anything the wall doesnt fix the issues with tunnels being built and people will always find ways to get to this country for instance overstaying their visas i think we should use the money for the wall and invest it in better technology and more ice agents
imigration reform yesbuild a wall seems cost ineffective
im not mexican im spanish  lol i have heard that one before
im not mexican im spanish
i think building a wall is a waste of money since most illegals come from flying
the second guy is living in a imaginary world of his mind
so instead of a wall we should just micro chip all humans freedom
the question is why how when did we let these fucking retards into our country who think they know what is best for our country a country with no borders is not a country at all and that dumbass wants to be the governor of nm wow
it doesnt make sense that he says 37 of crimes are committed by illegal immigrants but everyone says that blacks commit 53 of all crimes so youre telling me 90 of all crimes are committed by black people and immigrants even though america is 77 white those stats dont add up
usually enjoy these but the statistics steven referenced are just not true see pew or even reports from the conservative think tank cato institute
even if tagging everyone was a good idea which its not why was it so hard for leroy to understand that there would still need to be some sort of border with a checkpoint spot to read the tags  if there were no borders why would anyone go get tagged to then adhere to a checkpoint that you could easily walk around loli guess his idea does decrease drug trafficking though cause it would be legal to just walk it on over all the druglords could come and go as they please nobody has discussed how this would effect not only mexicans but the rest of the world  in his mind all illegal aliens would be allowed over from anywhere he specified that people were going to travel fast and borders were going to be a thing of the past
if you own a house do you have a fence between your house and your neighborsif you have a house or apartment do you have a front door  and if do do you keep it locked when youre not there  why do you have those things
im not with you on this one crowder a lot of illegal immigrants actually come to the country legally and just overstaya wall would also be extremly expensive it wouldnt be worth it imoi dont think illegal immigration is a major issue but if you want to put a foot down on illegal immigration just expand drone usage perhaps with automated software that recognizes movement or unusual heat patterns and then have it notify a responsible border officer including video so he can check if its an animal or human id assume that is technically very much feasible and would probvably be a lot cheaper
that spanish guy has no idea what hes talking about
instead of building a wall we should send these people back to school to get educated new mexico since 1550s 
yoo cant builda wall coz yoo dont be able to come baaaackthis type of uneducated statement is why the libtards even have a voice
love you man
i dont mean to be superreligious based argument man but whiteshirt man is proposing some 1984endofdaysantichrist type shit pretty disturbing moves 1984 from fiction to nonfiction in my local library
someone teach this guy how to use words other than like and yeah in every sentence do you support illegal immigration  then you should also support a scenario where anyone from any country should be able come to the us as well no international laws at all why just be it mexicans let people flood and overpopulate the us from all over the world because if you say only allow mexicans in youre just a little bias whining twat with no jurisdiction at all
its not mexico its everything south of mexico that we need to worry about when theyre economy shits the bed they will flee here
a wall would be just a waste of money for the us
white shirt guy is straight up tripping
the guy suggested to reward illegals if they cross the border so the ramification is the boarder will be flooded with different illegal nationalities people from other countries dont need to apply for citizen they just simply travel to mexico as tourist then cross the border then grant incentives to work poor american they will lose their own country which they build with their heart and soul
what the fuck drug is that guy on
fuck i wish i could do an interview like that these people are just strait up uneducated
how many illegal immigrants commit crimes literally all of them their existance as illegal immigrants is by definition illegal and therefore a crime
crowder could you post your statistics in the description
you enjoy talking to idiots good for you 
mind freak
before i say why i disagree with a wall i want everyone to know that yes i agree with we should have better support at the border and also need to have a better process for people who want to become us citizens i wont get into a political battle of why i disagree with a wall but just want to talk about how we can improve the border with a wall the national guard that helps the border patrol has more cameras to see whats going on at all times if we put more money into making boarder portal agentsnational guard troops with my technology it will be able to watch the areas to where they have had issues before in history most walls that have been made at boarders have been taken down with change i just think that if you want to have more people be us citizens let them come in but have to get a job pay taxes and go through the process with taking the test those are just my thoughts
youd be able to tell who it was even if you blur their face probably something i can argue with most other things i agree with from this channel the wall is a ridiculous cost to the taxpayer when there are so many other areas that could pump this money into not to mention the ongoing maintenance cost mexicans are on the decline coming into the country and also hard working people its ridiculous to expect mexicans to pay for the wall for something america wants the homicide rates and drug trade could be related a solution could be found there to drive those rates down its very a very undiplomatic is that a word approach to your direct neighbours and sends a bad message to the legal immigrants from mexico already in the country
i agree with the fact that illegal immigrants should not be allowed but building a wall seems dumb that would require a bunch of our tax money i think there should be some border enforcement just not a wall
to the second guy what
how do you fix the illegals immigrant problemthe spanish guy says make them legal citizens geniusgovernor run for president
lol tax the illegals how theres a reason for not going into the system and working for cash under the table  one criteria for citizenship should be conforming with us laws someone who doesnt want to conform to our systems and rules shouldnt be granted citizenship and be shipped out plain and simple  deport the violent illegals causing problems
building a wall isnt gonna change anything not only are there already tunnels built they also have latters in mexico but not only that there are certain areas of the border that are too difficult to direct construction on because of rocky or steep areas plus whos really gonna pay for the wall mexico the usa trump no one will pay for something thats unnecessary
x ray digital scanners he fancy as fuck the spanish elon musk easy there dreamer
the last guy was a complete uneducated dotard his arguments were without merit or evidence
the funny thing is that trump supporters actually think the wall is to keep mexicans out its to keep americans in when this country goes under the new world order
i still disagree  i dont want the wall built precisely because humans a clever individuals they will find a way  i believe in securing the border but find  a more cost effective way a giant wall looks to be like a waste of money  hire border patrol agents and increase drone operations sensors  towers heavy presence of good guys with guns hell deploy the national guard they need something to do
i like that guy
oh my god x ray may give them cancer but listening to this guy surely will give me cancer
when has a wall actually worked in history
please build the wall
this guy is an idiot trump did say that mexico is bringing the worst criminals rapist drugs smugglers to this country
this is what kills me this dude can barely speak and his vote counts just as much as mine and how does he sound like a east la mexican but hes been here since the 1550s
why are uneducated people even allowed to have opinions lmao  these people speak like theyre a 4th graders book report
i dont think the majority that stop to talk to you is not understand your political statement and the main goal is to change your mind about your beliefs on the topic for example build the wall and it drives me nuts because they feel that they need to yell and curse at you but some individuals have been supportive at your cause the first guy that you had an intelligent conversation had me at lost but the look on your face was priceless lol 
i like this series but even when is open for everyone is clear that you are far more prepared for this so at the end you are reinforcing your view in your channel im a mexican legally living in us soccer fan so soccer analogy is like if real madrid team comes and plays any of the mls rm are better prepared more equipped at the end whomever end ups watching the game end ups with the wrong idea that is a team that superior to the rest of them but is because they are not equally prepared for that match event when the mls team are professional players are not equally prepared
i like the guys ideas and you can tell he is really trying he is making some stupid ideas but at least he is trying
his ancestors live in the usa from xvi century but he still cant speak english properly america why do you need such stupid people
deport them all
lets just put in an invisible fence and put collars on all the brownies
yeah leroy is bringing the drugs in just not sharing with any one he is so not right jesus
i find it amazing how people sit there and cant even articulate their arguments smh
build that force field
leroy is a fucking dumbass
mastermind individuals
has he ever had his mind changed
dont a lot of people come in through tunnel systems so would the wall not be a waste of money
1317yeathis countrys fucked
my only problem with the wall is that i dont think it will work all that well and it will be incredibly expensive so a very expensive thing that wont work too well i think immigration needs more control but there must be a better way though maybe a wall is the best plan but if so then it should be similar to the wall that divides new helghan from the rest of vetka for maximum efficiency
the building of a wall would mean a fucking outrageous waste of money and resources that in the end wouldnt change anythinghow about the us changes its own society before wasting resources and money on a moronic project
definitely had to blur the first ladys face so much for la raza la raza unitiy lmao
take a shot every time the mexican dude says uh
the xray guy has his own show does anyone know whats its called looking for a good laugh
i want to see xray guys channel
when they are done with the southern border they should head north and build it around california too
illegal mexicans are not paying taxes just because you have a portion taken out of your paycheck so your employer can pay his taxes does not mean you pay taxes do you have a social security number no do you file taxes during tax season no do you pay property tax no so you do not pay taxes so stop that liberal bullshit lie
ignorant mexicans who come here illegally and refuse to learn our language is a real issue that needs to be addressed imagine if i cross the border into mexico illegally and refused to learn spanish how far do you think id get
1 wont change a thing 2 for those wanting to build the wall what are your thoughts on wet foot dry foot
lmao he expects illegal immigrants who want to live and scrub off others for free to just voluntarily walk through an xray point to get scannedlmao they just gonna walk around it
a wall is kind of silly because they already make bigger tunnels obviously it will not help only become more expensive and dangerous for the illegal immigrantsthey will get in or at least the hardcore criminals will cheaper options are better deportation and enforcing borders is good do not get me wrong wasting your money on a wall though sounds really silly though and not well thought through
leroys first comment says tax people coming in i just dont get how people think taxes fix all problems
sooooo he wants to let them in and use them for financial gain rightedit never mind it got way more strange only minutes later
dude xray total recall scanner wouldnt that be cool well uck you bic u pay for the god damn technology cant we just be fuckin civil and nuke mexico already
the spanish guy is sooooooooo dumb
immigration reform great idea building a wall extrandanarly expensive and impractical pretty simple dont disagree with crowder often but dont waste the tax payers money
building the wall will create a safe space for us citizens now your not denying me my safe space are you
that spanish dude is one of the dumbest people i have had to listen to ever wtf
the last basically would be happy providing accommodation to a whole town in his house
wow that mexican guy was very stupid wasnt he
racism you talk about mexicans being illegal you white people establish a colony by raping native american women pathetic
the drugzuhh
building a wall has never been good in any country we dont need one either
what the fuck was that guy talking about
hey steven im new to your channel bingewatching change my mind  intrigued but kind of skeptical as a convert to roman catholicism in brief i might propose that the wall is a symbol  and symbols are important and have been throughout history i know that this doesnt point to a statistic or other more tangible citation for the argument but i bet that a guy as wellresearched as yourself understands the palpability of such a symbolhey its been super refreshing to hear your socratic approach in the public forum  our young people especially have been starved of real argument its like coming up for air after writhing under the waters of irreproachable moral relativism gaspp s id love a personal response to discuss catholicism  i sense that you and i have a lot in common but could both really benefit from some civil debate god bless you my brotherjames
drugsuh
xray gate please deport him
you are a very patient man
what scares me about a wall isnt that people cant come in its that if marshall law is ever inacted americans wouldnt be able to get out
him xray gate that reads your idharvard nigga you want a scholarship
all we need to do is build around leroys brain and genitals god help us if he gets another chance to express his point of view and god help us if he ever reproduces
wish someone with more knowledge stepped up  i disagree on his vies but its because i know reform could be done differently
that spanish dude is clueless im glad he sat down and was open to some dialogue but he completely contradicted himself how can you know who to tax if you cant control who is coming in
that 1st guy was the dumbest fucking person ive ever seen
that is it im gonna call you chip 
trump  yee yee 
just cause you dont know any people that bring in drugs doesnt mean it doesnt happen
not trying to be a dick but leroy is not the sharpest tool in the shed was miss teen south carolina circa 2007 his school teacher i was waiting for a with like such as us americans drop
a 10 feet wall will only increase the demand for 11 feet ladders
woah xray guy is crazy
did you know that from the us mexican border down to south america that those countries are responsible for over one quarter of the murders in the world  along with the huge production of drugs build the wall
your face after that clown proposed a wall an xrays scanning gateway in his head was priceless lol
i dont know about border patrol but us airport security are some fucking assholes why cant people be effective at their jobs without being rude inconsiderate bastards id rather tell foreigners to just stay home if they consider a visit to the us
homes be trippin
ahahahha xray wall
im glad joe rogan called him a fuck face
you should sit down with wil weaton and have a chat that would be awesome and i would buy so much merch if you did you should consider him as your next throw down similar to the techcrunch one
please do one of these in a deadpool outfit
so in essence the aspiring new mexico governor leeroy is going to adopt and implement ideas from 1940 nazi germany but with a modern twist microchip them coming inscan them at the border with high energy xrays and keep them under observation whilst in american territory orwellian style gotcha
i kind of think the wall is just a little bit stupid
the reason why they never built a wall is costso why dont you all pay for the wall yourselvesthen you can have the walloh shit mexico is going to pay for itlol
an xray gate  so deporting people is bad but giving them cancer is fine
so the mexican doesnt agree with immigration laws but  wants technology that can be hacked to be in charge of immigration and he wants be the governor of  new mexico wow mexico is gonna be alright
i wonder if crowder tried lifting bricks between his cheeks to practice for the wall
have you seen the wall prototypes and the requirements  even if it was possible to build a wall that most people couldnt defeat with a 5 modification on a 15 dollar grappling hook it would cost billions if not trillions of dollars not to mention maintenance of said wall  the cost of continual satellite images with boarder patrol is more effective and cheaper  another option is to produce high resolution 360 degree cameras with infrared on poles that an ai monitors for movement and notifies a volunteer or min wage work force to pick up people  the poles would have ping a server every 5 mins to make sure nothing has happened to the camera and the ai should be able to pick up camera blockage  tunnels would still be a problem but a seismic shockwave detector might help with that and provide scientists with valuable earthquake information  the wall they are building now is just for show and it is an expensive one at that  httpwwwusdebtclockorg
what the mexican dud is sugesting is a passport union for example sweden norway denmark and finland have had that for ages it works here i live in sweden or rather use to work because the government and police between the countries could share data but now when we have the eu open border situation it dont workit also have to be a situation where people that come in to one country is regestered in the system for example if you are a swedish citizen you may pas into norway but if you are a non swedish  or a number of other countires citizen you have to register visa to pass inthis system do work but only if the countries share information
mexicans have the lowest iq of any race i think idk why but they are really dumb its in their genetic makeup that make them so stupid thats why we need a wall bc they are so dumb they need to turn to criminal acts to make a living thats why the statistics show asians and indians dont commit acts of crime bc they have brains and are able to make money bc they are smart why cant mexicans just stay in their country and live with themselves why do they feel the need to come to america
that dudes solution to illegal immigration is to have these people go through a legal immigration system
are you serious what part of the ignorance world are these people from very polite though
theres also the problem that the illuminati wont give up the xray border technology i hear they have it stashed away with the 100 mpg carburetor
that second guy was such a dumbass it was painful to watch
i can only speak for myself but i will just teleport past your xray border so put that in your pipe and smoke it
mastermind individuals to help this guyanyone wanna help this poor uninformed fella out hahahaha i think hes taking some of those opioids
xray friggin laser beams that come from space and a written explanation
this really proves how emotionally gullible and misinformed the vast majority of people are
wish i would have found this channel sooner a lot of very interesting debates and topics saying this i dont believe the wall is the right solution i just think it is a larger and more expensiveconcrete or whatever it is going to be made out of version of what we alreadyhave i dont think it will fix any of our illegal immigration problems but instead just waste money that could go to a better cause to benefit the country or to better solution to illegal immigration
at least he had manners and was decent but wow low iq
now i really dont like u if tht happens a lot of my family would be gone so i hope u goto hell and god gives u wht u deserve
usa is a great country i lived there for eleven years and where some of the best years of my life arriving at the age of five illegaly i started school until 9th grade and then deciding to go back to mexico ive learned many things about mexico and most of its people alot whom are corrupt and selfish more than us citizens obiously theres corrupt people all around the world but i hate how mexicans who live in the usa talk smack about it defending mexico its hipocracy i understand many people cross the border because of econmical needs but it costs way more illegally than legally its ones job to get informed and not use it as an excuse ive seen that in mexico many people who complain waste their money on garbage food beer and parties i love amrica and wish to go back soon legally as an athlete to represent it
this nigga wants to be a governor wtf
taxing illegal immigrants isnt a bad idea though
why should we build the wall arent we for diversity and equality more people that come here the more people would be contributing to taxes what happened to the land of opportunities and what is a wall really going to do people get passed it all the time its a huge waste of money in my opinion
1057 scientifical 
we spend billions on legal and illegal immigrants legal immigrants from latin america use government aid at a much higher rate 70 than immigrants from europe  28 we can choose who we let in we dont have to take in the poorest most uneducated people we can take more people that will be a benefit to us rather than a disability to us since 1965 weve given preferential immigration to poor third world regions and thats great hopefully weve helped those millions of people but we can elect to make smarter choices about future immigrants 
im mexican and a big fan of your show crowder congratulations the wall its not the problem in mexico its our corrupt government saludos desde mxico lindo y querido
ok so im half hispanic and i have family over there my father works in the border where hispanics cross over here or us americans go over there he says there shouldnt be a wall because the percent that cross illegally might be  bad but are really really smart and a wall is not gonna stop then they would do anything to cross right now there probably already planning or working on crossing with a wall so i believe there shouldnt be a wall  i love your videos not hating or anything just my side 
is it me or this guys seems like hes on something  lol
stevencrowder ive seen a few of your change your mind videos  not bad  i agree with some of your points and disagree with others  i guess im whats called a centrist or authorative libertarian i have a few questions for you1  when you say build a wall where do you want to build this wall and why2  please tell me when you say immigrant why ethnicnational demographic are you speaking ofthanks
bruh whoever owns that van lives 2 streets down from me
this guy might be on to something an electronic virtual wall but it comes back to the question if someone comes though illegally what happens what should the action be that is what really is the question not the wall but how do we handle thos who dont follow the law
gosh that was painful to watch and listen to did anyone check to see if he was an illegal alien because no normal human being is that stupid he must be from another planet
whats up with the dope walter shirts are you guys a fan of walter
ay why dont we just make crossing the border illegal checkmate drumpf
 lets put an xray machine with some engineers and jugglers and clowns with some bears doing tricks at the border wtf is that guy talking about
the real boss hogs
fuck people are soooooooooooooooooo stupid
xray gatehahaha this guy is an idiot
he talk a lot and makes absolutely no sensehell be a great govener
build the wall in your ass  
you dirty fucks she didnt want to be heard and you still disrespected her and betrayed the obvious trust she gave you you prick
the wall works both ways people
building a wall has nothing to do with people entering this country its to keep americans in and this country is so dummied down they cannot see it
imagine if there was no wall everyone in juarez next to the border would come into americaand they are some scary people there
im against the wall but the nigga w the camera was on something
im from england and almost everyone i know is antitrumpexcept the girl i like thats why im doing my research
so im for strict border policies but a physical wall is idiotic we have illegal immigrants from eastern europe southeast asia and the middle east they still find ways to get here with a wall we will just see more people traveling to canada and coming down i think we give the border patrol more bodies and a higher budget to do their job rather than a big obnoxious wall that will be torn down anyway the second a democrat comes into office god they will be a hero with the left look at me tear down this wall it will be a reagangorbachov moment for the left
who sells that shirt  walther 
that mexican lady is literally retarded
im going to mexico so let me grab my lead clothing and get my reason ready to tell the xrays
lol that woman is a hero  
soverignty should never be thrown to the side do you want borders on your personal property or can i just move on in 
726 now i might have have a more in depth knowledge about mexicans and drugs i used to be an addict  and a liberal lol and the best people to score from was the mexicans  i capitilized bc thats what we called them they were most often associated with the mexican mafia andor ms13 one could buy heroin balloons in other areas caps for 5 a peice if spending 100 or more it happened when i lived in a small town it happened when i lived in columbus ohio and dayton ohio so ita not just big cities so when it is stated that they bring drugs over andor commit crimes in the us i know for a fact it is absolutely true i have been clean for 6 years and jave completely changed my life
wow i love the fact that you put the legal mexican american in this video this victim culture is putting real victims in trouble this woman was afraid to say anything against out loud i hope she did report
i think we should take the momentum of why people are behind the wall and the momentum four basic immigration change and border security and all the money that its whooped up but instead of building a wall but instead of building a wall i think we should put soldiers and or ice units on the border i think we should have two armed security persons stationed 1 mile apart all along the border each station equipped with an armored vehicle and a security dogalong with boats and any other equipment that the terrain would call for
i just got dumber listening to the spanish guy
did he say his family has been in new mexico since 1950  the first sign of colonization in the americas by spain were as early as 1492 but from what i recall they only made it to parts of florida then  correct me if im wrong  nonetheless leroy is on some good shit lol
the wall would only be a monument of racism because it will not stop ilegal immigrants  just a waste of our taxes to gain popularity towards one party
i think its funny that people really dont know that there already is a wall trump is a really smart guy because he got millions to believe that there isnt one already in place 
steven crowder can you change your mind are you willing if you are not wiling no one can change your mind you seem to be saying that you are not wiling so why should we bother trying
you shouldve clarified that illegal immigrants commit those crimes not just migrants
what the hell he is saying xray dude u living in 2018 but your little mind think u in 4018 xray wall 
i believe the main cause that most people are against it is because they are misinformed and dont realize that there is a way to get into the us leagly and yes it takes some time but it is a way that we can make sure you are here and that if you are in need we can help
wowi cant handle this much stupidhow does steven do it
i love crowder but i hate how his fans shit on nontraditional ideas since they dont follow societal conventions some of the greatest ideas sprouted from unconventional ideas
that spanish dude said so many outlandish things that sound so fantasy
the drug cartels will keep profiting off of the usa and the illegal immigrants will keep flooding in i dont see a point in the wall other than a waste of money on a fancy wall
i dont think we should build a wall for many reasons some of the biggest is that a wall is a massive use of both money and natural resources not to mention that we would have to build on native american land and through many different ecosystems a lot of americas schools science programs national parks space exploration and healthcare are heavily underfunded and i feel we should not project our time on a wall that will both steer our national budget farther away from those essential things not to mention the united states would be paying for this for decades to centuries to come we have fences and border patrols in place and there is still such thing as flying over and boating around therefore the wall would be ineffective too
im against the wall but wow that second guy sounded like an idiot
xray boarder lol
if the wall has to cross over national parks like big bend im not for it nothing can change my mind about that if you want to build a china wall berlin wall and avoid national parks go ahead we have enough man built things all over the country
i want a wall but only because i think it would be cool to have a great wall of america but i dont think that a wall would actually stop anyone from coming in
building the wall would be a tax taxation is theft changed your mind i hope
0000010 never mind
a canadian is against immigration when hes in the usa lmao
as a mexican living in mexico i agree with building the wall on the border in mexico we do not have many job opportunities a significant percentage of the country lives in poverty or with the minimum wage or less inclusive a new president will take office on december 1 in mexico hopefully during these next six years there will be a substantial change both at the economic and social levels the government of the united states has every right to build a wall if it means protecting its citizens for them mexico has the same problem many illegal immigrants enter the country some stay to live but others are only passing through to enter the united states but some also commit crimes within our territory building the wall does not violate human rights in any way on the contrary problems such as police brutality on the border would be avoided the only thing i do not agree with is that mexico pays for the wall that must be paid by the united states mexico should do its part by generating better and good jobs for its people so that they do not try to cross into the united states illegally
second guy was funny af
a 1954 mile long xray scannerthis dude high af
women love to talk shit because they know that some men wont do shit they are far too comfortable talking shit to menif i ever see a woman with a black the only thing i can think of is man bitch shouldve listened the first time
hopefully he gets shot with a 12 gauge
i dont see it slowing down any time soon the immigrants will come in anyway that is why we want to build the wall so we can stop them this guy thinks xray borders will stop immigration what a complete moron xrays are used to see through things
lmao x ray scanner across the whole boarder huh
tax all the illegals lmao
i think what he means is he wants to micro chip all mexicans thats kinda fucked up
xray guys border sounds way oppressive  lets tag everyone in mexico then we will know if they come into our country 
you know what i like that mexican dude or spanish whatever he might be clueless gets stuck or doesnt know anymore how to answer he at least isnt aggrasive when he is clearly wrong he is just not well informed and gets informed he gets his mind changed and is very chill about it unlike all the college snowflakes
building a wall is the most idiotic thing our govmnt can possibly do how about lets get tighter with our border patrol  make  becoming a citizen a lot easier becoming a us citizens is actually a very complex process that not many of us us born citizens would be able to pass if we build a wall whats next people are going to start using the northern border then what are we going to build a wall on that border also lets us that money that is potentially going to go to building a wall to help our veterans homeless people and our education that is suffering due to cut funding
love the last guy crowded spoke with very respectful and reasonable and very good debate need more people like this sitting down to speak with crowder
the x ray guy is smoking some them drugs
what kind of drug is leroy on
some type of id to scan and make sure the us knows what your doing here isnt that what we call immigration and using a passport
he makes me embarrassed to be a new mexican
white shirt guy wants to turn the us into a dystopia
for those of you that never have been to the usa and mexico border there already is a standing structure that is very high and very long the only places were it does not exist is near the river basin why spend our tax money on tearing down the existing structure and build a new one hire more border patrol  and secure the river basin if an undocumented immigrant not speaking specifically about mexican immigrants because a significant amount of undocumented immigrants  come from other countries as well should be found in offense they should be find then deported if the immigrants are repeat offenders then they should be deported to the furthest part of his or her native country with no financial means  please remember this as well food for thought this great nation was built on the blood sweat tears and countless great sacrifices of immigrants it was built by their backbone not one person in this great country is a native american other than the native americans everyone is a immigrant the real american people have been robbed of their land so stop and think about that and how we became such a great country because of immigrants we need to get rid of the lawbreaking immigrants and embrace those that contributing to the workplace and our community 
i think that we should find a way to stop illegal immigrants but a wall wont do much to stop people because most immigrants come in from plane and it would just cost too much money and it wouldnt do enough to make it worth the money
most funny video of the year 
the war on drugs is a war on cartels and other gangs if the govt isnt pushing it then its a problem
dude said his family has been in new mexico since the 1550s 
hope trump goes straight pokmon on em
i think if the government ran a full criminal record and if the potential citizen is a innocent person that they should be able to go to usa within a year or two and the people with a record of murderdrugsscamrape and thievery the person should never be able to enter usa and if mexicans did not have to wait as long not many would enter usa illegal but for the people that cant enter we know those would be the people who are jumping the boarder that we can deport them right away and maybe even use physical force because we know those people would be bad and would not have to worry about hurting a innocent persons life
the guy from new mexico is all over the place
how are you gonna tax people who are here legally and arent citizens that makes no sense
scientificalyep the spanish guy is just a silly idealist who is not in touch with reality
instead of a wall how about a 50 or so feet deep trench it would be easier to maintain than a wall
please build the fucking wall im hispanic and i approve the wall 
this dude is a fucking idiot 
tax em put a social security number on them guess what we already do when its done legally but when it is done illegally we cannot tax them or put a social security number on them
that dude that thinks hes spanish wtf  he totally looks central american or native american he does not look european what a fuckin dumb ass
wish i couldve been there i would love having this debate with youi was prowall but ive come to learn it might not actually help with our immigration problemmore than 50 of illegal immigration happens from air traffic while yes the wall would slow down illegal immigration some the sheer cost of building a wall will dramatically exceed its effectiveness and in the end be a waste of time  moneyi feel we have better more efficient ways to stop illegals from coming in that doesnt need a wallfor instance our cameras have become insanely high def it would in the end be far cheaper to have every kilometer or so be hooked with cameras along the border and keep track of humans coming in and alert authorities
i have a very quick way o stop all this left wing bs tell them fine no wall but all that vote for no wall pay a tax fgor supporting the 33 million illegals they will stfu real quick same foe all the political bs make them pay for it it will stop fast
leroy is a dumbass he has been globally brainwashed he wants all to be chipped and a one world govmnt and bitcoin as currency agenda21 1984 rex 84 bollshevik revoloution look them up
glad my house doesnt have xray walls be bloody cold
507 im not mexican im spanish i was drinking soda when he said that it came out of my nose when i laughedthis guy is so full of shit he needs an enema if hes spanish im a martian hes the brownest spaniard i have seen in my lifeapperently he dosent know that spanish were decendants of the goths a white european people hes rather indigenous looking for a visigothic spaniard but i digress
i feel like trumps policies are okay but the way he presents his policies makes it seem as though he is racist
democrats we can tax people coming into the country please democrats do not vote please for your childrens future
the real boss hogs  leroy 
dang this guy is actually retarded
that ladyit be ya own niggas
idk how you sat thru talking to him hahaha
some sort of gate uh whats going to stop them from going around that gate though perhaps a wall 
4oo shhhh women you ever watched  secareo youll end up in a wall
that fucking first ladies argument lmaaaaaooooooo im dead  this world is going to shit lol 
the proposed wall would be insanely expensive and unlikely to be effective i worked briefly with border patrol in yuma some years ago and the one take away from the experience is just how committed these people are it is common to arrest process and deport a person only to arrest them again a few days later the majority of the captures i was a apart of were the same individuals and groups over and over they tear out the filling in car seats and hide inside the seat with someone else then sitting on them as the seat in engine compartment and storage containers when youre willing to risk as much as these people do to get here many die of dehydration heat exhaustion or by animal attack en route a wall is not a major obstacle maybe there would be a marginal improvement but i cant imagine that change being significant enough to justify the cost
was the first guy retarded damn his look is sickening
1030 xray border
the wall is just one of many tools to prevent illegal border crossing it really shouldnt be that big of deal it just got turned into a symbol that way too many people took personally
506 im not mexican im spanish
a physical wall is a waste of money because it wont work without constant patrols so why not just ditch the wall and keep the patrols also motion sensors work well and are already implemented in some places
lol that show dude mentioned that he didnt want a border yet he wants a electronic xray border and he want to be governor im not voting for him lol he dumb af
maybe i m confused x  love u lady
i can only support building the wall if it is made out of legos change my mind
stevens face at the end im dying lool
leroy what youve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard at no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul
im actually mad he didnt lay into this guy it wouldve done him a  favor in the long run he legitimately thinks hes going to become the governor of mexico and build an xray wall
how can you tax people who come with no money what the heck
i like how the new mexican doesnt understand the statistic of the percentage of people who commit crimes and are american citizens compared to the percentage of immigrantsillegals who commit crimes disproportionality
the wall is a total waste of money  many illegal immigrants are here because they overstayed their visasthis is a very complex issue with no simple solution trump was just pandering to his poorly educated base when he started with this ridiculous wall idea
lmao for illegal immigration you want the country to become a fucking zoo
im not well educated about this just gonna put that out there but anyways i dont understand how as a country we can afford to build a wall  its not really needed we can control a border without a wall anyways yeah lol merica
wtf are these people talking about tax criminals and drug dealers to make it right the conservatives will fight back one of these days to restore sanity
one i have with the wall is that it isnt going to do much the vast majority of illegal immigrants are people who came here legally and just overstayed their visas i am certainly for limiting immigration to a rate that the job and housing market can handle also the wall would be expensive as shit
so build an invisible wall and track their every move lmao
nothing  will prevent sombody from doing what they want to do   lol   instead of using all that concrete and materials for a wall  use it to help fix up parts of mexico or wherever its needed      buncha dumb fucks   amuuurkaa 
it is the same old story the intelligent people vs the morons
scientifical
and sorry what is the percentage of school shooters church shooters mall shooters movies shooters child rapists and molesters right white people it goes hand in hand
oh shit i misspelled governor oki was a little bit retarded on that one 
i think the wall will certainly help i dont know why people have such a problem with it unless youre for illegal immigration
i love the next govenor of new mexico to use his wordshe was really scientifical fucking retard
an xray border people we are the future
how many of the illegal immigrants are committing crimes boi all of them 
anyone against the wall should put a sign on there unlocked door that says come on in all welcome not every person coming through is a criminal not every person coming through is bad not every person is carryingdoing drugs but how would you know when youre welcoming everyone in some dont have a job and wont get a job some will carry drugs in or do drugs some may not provide for your house hold people immediately say that a wall is inhumane but will talk down on people who use food stamps or will turn away from people asking for help on the streets we want change but refuse to do what it takes to make the change then when something happens we all wana cry how did this happen
i love how you are willing to entertain peoples ideasopinions even if its totally unrealistic or impossible it shows you really just want a civil discussion thank you for your videos
borders will be a think of a past  thats fantastic lets start by removing your fences from your house so your neighbors and strangers can just walk across your backyard and join in when you are bbqing
steven asked for an alternative to the wallwell these are my thoughts with a focus on guatemala el salvador and hondurasmost immigrants are leaving their countries because of very difficult situations if they truly had a choice theyd stay dont you think they miss where they come from sometimes they spend decades without going back and why do i say they dont really have a choice imagine that you live in a neighborhood controlled by a gang like mara salvatrucha or barrio 18 not how theyre in los angeles since thats light compared to how it is in central america you can find documentaries with very strong images if you live in this type of neighborhood you will either a be extorted assaulted or murdered or b have to join the gang with these options anyone would rather die or be raped attacked etc crossing mexico and several frontiers just to get away from ityou might think its our problem but the us has a huge responsibility in this youd have to read about the american imperialism in latin america during the last century besides the guatemalan and salvadoran civil wars to understand how its even right to say the us created the gangs and keeps perpetuating our poverty and corruptionwith this strong responsibility instead of building a wall to just evade the problem the us should spend more time people and money to help us solve our issues if youre at fault of something its not fair to leave the victim make it look as the enemy and act as if history doesnt exist only because youre starting to experience the consequences of your own actionsby helping our countries our people would have no necessity to leave therefore a wall is not the solution since there are deeper roots that will create more and more immigrants even if you build a whole fort along the nationthere i might not have changed your mind but hopefully youll try to get more background information for a problem that seems present but has been growing since the 80s a wall solves nothing the us shouldnt run away from its responsibilities
first of all i strongly doubt that anyone can change your mind because you dont want to allow your self to understand a different perspective of things i can agree that illegal immigration needs to be addressed but i will be honest a wall wont do shit pardon my french i say yes deport criminals i say keep all hard working individuals that are dying to contribute to the american society now i know a lot of people say illegals are stilling america citizens jobs lol but please tell me when was the last time you saw an american citizen picking strawberries or cutting grass for bellow minimum wage
lol how do i report these people
where is steven crowder getting these statistics id like to see that source anyone anyone 
the old world  shouldve built a wall before vikings columbus  every american is a product of illegal immigrants
this afraid lady one day could be your mother
i like steven crowder and the topics he brings up in change my mind however i think a wall is not necessary nor will it fix the issue of illegal immigrationmore ways for the government to spend our tax contributions in a poorly effective way is not the solution just my two cents
oh god  hopefully people dont use that guy to represent immigrants or latinos lol but im for the wall coming from a immigrant but the wall honestly isnt going to stop anything
pc  console change my mind
poor lady i hope she gets peace of mind and a safe place to live
that dudes a fucking retard he an illegal go get em ice
spanish guy was actually retarded his solution to illegal immigration is to round em all up and make them take a test to become citizens why dont the illegal ones just do that now they cant because theyre leeches that want to leave their shithole country to come here and steal jobs
yes they are losing 10 billion dollars
new mexico since the 1550s lmaooooo
wtf
this guy said im spanish from spain lol
i finally disagreed with you
we should sell california to mexico and use that money to build the wall california is a shithole infested with homosexuals illegal immigrants and far left liberal gun grabbing pussies we are better off without them call me whatever you like but the fact is im right and i dont care if you are offended
gotta love that spanish guy yeah lets not build a wall cause thats so unhuman but lets keep track on everyone with micro chips because thats so much better
illegal immigrants commit crimes way more than legal citizens  every single one who is here illegally is committing a crime just by being here why is this so hard to comprehend you wanna come to america no problem  get in line and wait your turn
what does a mexican and a cue ball have in common the harder you hit em the more english you get out of them
we only need xrays in strip clubs because those strippers dont pay taxes 
i lost brain cells listening to that guy
im hispanic and all i say is that no matter what they do theyre still going to find a way in and that us meant for all illegals not just mexicansshit without all this illegal shit we wouldnt have border patrol or other organizations devoted to these causes would we its all just one giant monopoly game where the higher ups are the people actually doing the bad things
how about we better healthcare and schools
listen i respect others opinions but when they make sense how are you to give ids to people coming across the border if you are not patrolling the borders i think it boils down to educating yourself on the facts then make a good educated decision i think too many of these people watch cnn fake news
how do you tax someone that doesnt pay taxes works under the table and sends our money back to mexico also dont want to get their citizenship for the fear they wont be able to go home
build the wall with your ass bitch lmaoooo
hahahawere screwed
ok american citizens i have a plan to fix this wholeproblem we simply go tomexico and take it over fix the carpets and the drapes and sell it for profit to australia now its there problem and we could pay off all our chinese debts lol or we could sell it to germany i bet they would enjoy a nice vacation from all the snow and they are pros at making sure people dont leave lmao
steven you need to think more youre smart sometimes but your political alignment makes you dumb the other times yeah btw you are glass can see through you
a check in system you mean like a passport
lazer ou cameras steve  lol pas un mure hahahahah sauvage p
okay i agree that there needs to be some rules and regulations for moving into the country however i disagree with building a wall because it seems like a huge waste of money if the illegal immigrants coming to the united states wanted to come here theyll find a way here side note i was born lucky i was born in a country where if i needed something  i could get it my biggest hardship could probably never compare to the struggling of those trying to find refuge from poverty or war every living human being deserves this freedom i could never personally understand what its like to really go to bed cold and hungry or worried if i was going to survive the next few days  this is why i believe that this type of freedom should be available for those who fight for it i believe that it should be a less expensive and less lengthy process for those who are good people regardless of race or country
this has been the most pointless change my mind 70 of american agree that building a wall is pointless and waste of tax money
you filthy white ass hole privileged cracked god damn you are what you eat you fucking cracker
this guy is then idiot migrations what give everyone citizenship lol
building a wall is a waste of time and money the best answer to solve this problem is to take down the mexican government many mexicans will agree that their government is corrupted mexicans cannot afford to come here legally due to the cost and travel just to get a visa at a single place plus if youre a woman you can never go legally without getting married and getting a great job
people travel to other countries to see their history and their culture america wont have its european culture in 50 years its been successfully invaded by people fleeing their own home countries and refusing to assimilate in any way
i wish i could have been there to try and change your mind i believe in increasing border patrol but not in building the wall economically we cannot support the wall cost to be built the way they would like it to be built the us his so well in debt that economical way would probably be higher more border patrol the cost to build and to keep the wall at the span that they would like to build it it just not ethical or cost effective
new mexico guy is totally clueless your right a wall would at least help i think america should pay for it though their idea its not mexico itselfs fault for ppl illegally migrating to america
so instead of a wall lets do an invisible xray gate the length of california and texas come to the xray gate with a brief explanation as to why you wanna come here and get your id tag  and your set to go gotcha 
lmao when she covered the mic and talked directly into it 
china built it 1st
xray wall hmmmaybe the security wall from the beginning of the movie of the running man lol
that second dude basically just suggested microchipping people 
512 he gotta weird heard
also just an idea why not just have heat signatures so we know when someone is near the border then have  drones come over and check it out if they attempt to shot down or cause any warm shoot them with a tranquilizer dart or something a long those lines then have someone pick them up and transport them into there rightful country contact there country as well so they know whats happening
im totally for building the wall but it is going to cost so much money is it really worth it especially because we are so much in debt as is thats my only problem with building the wall
well for positives from the drug wartheres now chemicals to stop you people from overdosing
does this nigga think we live in the matrix
im from new mexico sitting in albuquerque right now and let me tell you the last guy is totally from new mexico lol this guys accent is so real eeeeee ha ha ha and yeah he sounds like alot of the politicians out this way
has anyone changed his mind at all in these segments
im pro separating families change my mind
this guy is a fake he throws out statistics that are simply untrue just look up the murder rate for undocumented immigrants and ends with some intelligent sounding followup whenever he gets truly challenged by someone he tactically shuts them down he either tells them theyre bringing up anecdotes when he does it all the time too or he will say theyre being rude when they arent though obviously some cant maintain their anger this guy would never do a debate where statistics from various studies are used because hed get torn apart hes good at using tactics to prove his point but thats it and that shows hes hardly interested in having his mind changed i wish him into obscurity and wouldnt feel that way if he didnt use ridiculous statistics from ridiculous studies and instead used legitimate stats hed never do that hes interested in pushing his agenda nothing more
just to be clear he isnt realy for a wall  he just wanted some public opinion or steven is a reasonable man and he would now that the wall aint the solution for the immigrant problem
a friend 60 yrs ago when her family became citizens they were required to sign a document that said they would not receive any government assistance for so many years or ever  i dont remember the details but i think if we dont do that now we need to do it again
that look at the camera at the end was some classic jim from the office vibes
losing brain cells
can someone give me stats on the crime rate of illegals my sjw class claims that illegals have a lower rate of crime than citizens while crowder claims the opposite
that look on stevens face  the end  pure gold 
i dont get americans who wouldnt want to secure their border why would you want illegal immigrants in your country who get stuff for free and free health care because they have no money or anythingcome to the country legally thats all the usa wantsthis generation is insane wtf
he sounds like the burger king foot lettuce guy
so he is saying no wall no border control but have a scanner thing whats the fucking difference
i wish i would see him one day i swear i would sit down and let him see another view hes clearly only choosing people who have no idea to make it seem that his side is right ugh
illegal immigrants commit less crimes that actual citizens omg where did this republican get his stats from 
im amazed at how much someone can say without actually saying anything
why not build a net lol a wall is ridiculous immigration reform is a great idea but a wall
crowder man youre awesome
where do you find these people
i dont know why steven is for the wall i always thought he was more on the libertarian side on this issuei always he thought he was more for freedom of movement as well disappointing
mexican people think they deserved to be in us they feel so entitled youre not american youre immigrants dont act like you own america im asian by the way and we dont act like that
your stats are so off
that exray guy was from the future
all i can say is lolol to the arguments presented in this video
how can i build the wall with my ass if she can tell me how i will gladly do it
omg that guy is talking about communism in the technology world everywhere you go you are electronically scanned so goverment watches everything knows all your details think i prefer the wall this guy needs to watch enemy of the state my money and info stays with me thanks 
you couldnt find a lot of people to discuss because a lot of people want that wall
at the end of the day you werent hating on mexican people but what they cross the border illegaly what you dont understand is what mexicans are willing  to do in order to have a better life and there is no wall that can stop us
mexican ingenuity will always trump pun intended any obstacle in front of them
yo
whats the point of building a wall i mean how many walls have been built throughout history that has been affected it country in a positive way
as a high school student i would do anything to stop at least some amount of illegal drugs flowing into america from mexico ive seen so many kids lives ruined by them
statistically theyre the ones bringing the drugs but who are the ones selling the drugs you cannot sell what you do not have
the charts below come froma december 2016 study publishedin the journal of ethnicity in criminal justice they show that us saw a 118 increase in its immigrant population documented and undocumentedfrom 1980 through 2016yet during this same period the rate of violent crime  homicides rapes robberies and assaults according to the fbi  fell by 36 to about 386 incidents per 100000 residents
while any death is tragic a february 2018 study by thecato instituteusing 2015 crime statistics from texas found immigrants in the country illegally were 25 percent less likely to be convicted of homicide than nativeborn americans legalimmigrants were 87 percent less likely
where does he find these people im against the wall but the statement they make are not well explained
honestly the second guy is an embarrassment
i think respectively i would love to try to change your mind  i love your videos  i hope sometime i could see you with a table on the street so i could pop a squat
i support a wall based on the reasons why the government says we need one however are the walls put up to keep crime out or keep us in
im a hispanic american that being said  build the fucking wall alreadyits so sad seeing so many hispanics are clueless about this issue how do you tax a ghost  why are these people speaking so fucking retarded  wtf 
1st lady is a fucken fat moron build a wall to pin this bitch from talking
ice wont do anything
holy fuck leroy needs to breath for a second shit 
people clapped when that guy got upwe need to stop rewarding mediocrity change my mind
hahahaha that 2nd guy
xray border  the fuck  some matrix shit
i like this guy leroys charisma but its not realistic
xray scanner lmao this guy is fuckin lost
listening to the second guy gave me a headache if you have no clue about the topic please just keep walking the fact that you didnt roll your eyes throughout the entire conversation is impressive
its actually proven that he loves trannies
you love trannys hahahaha
obviously your parents never loved you
i respect healthy debate and on some levels what you do however am i supposed to be impressed that you out debated random people on the street it is sad to see how uneducated the population is but i am smart enough to see how this television show works i would be interested to see the peopleinterviews who you left out from this not to say you are completely skewing you end pr4oduct rather i take this all with a more than a grain of salt which i encourage everyone to do because at the end of the day it is a business a persona etc im truly not saying youre fake or incorrect rather it seems  like an educated person who has some trained debate tactics preying on unsuspecting people this i do think serves a purpose i suppose but the goodservice you claim to be doing is illegitimate in my eyes except for the fact that your show has the potential to influence people if you debated experts on the subject im sure youd have very little views im sure its all about your dick being a little bigger when it comes down to it but trust me bud youll still have a pretty little one 
can you link me to the statistics about the 35 of undocumented immigrants committing 37 of homicidal crimes
so the wall stops people how is what im curios abot have they discovered all tunnels now do they close borders completely what about the oceans on the drugs side you must control the consumer before you control the distributerproducer theyre beinging it iver by demand why dont they send some to columbia they produce their own on the crime sidehomicide rates  very good point i cant argue with you there as far as taxes who do you get these stats from if they are under the radar say you have 11 million imiggrants could be way more could be way less how would you know if they are under the radar thats only an estimate ive worked with gentleman that us fake information fake names etc whos fault is that if theyre already doing that companies that still give work to those people some knowing for a fact that isnt their correct information again supply vs demand not enough workers not enough producers especially fields like construction restaurants  etc welfare they cant get because they dont even have a social you say no wall equals bigger problem because it keeps growing how do you narrow out the good from bad an immigration reform the bad will not want to do everything legally the good will pay what they have to to get that green card theres people that save up for that with hope that there will be a reform that is the solution immigration reford for those already here working the procees is expensive make it 15000 im almost certain these people will pay that because that is all they want the hard workers then they will pay taxes because they wont be scared to be looked for if theygive heir name and adress theyre afraid to put a target on themselves thats why they dont pay taxes some jobs wont hire and out of necessity they join bad programs they steal they kill because they have to eat just like any other american all i have seen and i dont go off of these so called statistics because they arent accurate they dont ask every single person they ask a few and us it as a majority is that the more you try to regulate block out the bigger the problem will be its like gun control the only people that will suffer are the law abiding citizens with the wall mass deportations the only people being kept out are the ones that really want to be here criminals will get to where they want regardless of walls laws  rules whatever the wall isnt the only way to get in there are tunnels way deeper then the 6 ft that they want ways to climb a huge wall if a scorchinng hot desert doesnt stop them if a shark infested ocean doesnt stop them if all these sicknesses on ships didnt stop the europeans nothing will if you cant fight it use it to your advantage dont always look at the bad side of things if its broken fix it
yeah lets not disrespect illegals by building a wall lets tag them like cattle instead
aaah hes from santa fe explains everything
i support small government and responsible spending  immigration arguments aside the idea of the wall seems contradictory to these ideas
just tax them
one reason the wall should be built is to stop sexy slave trades why doesnt these fucking dumbasses ever think about that
wow that was painful i tried to get through it couldnt do it with the scientifical guy
ok i like and agree with most of your topics but this one you gotta come go south texas more specifically the valley hildago county and set up at stc or even utrgv id love to change your mind
why dont we get america and put it somewhere elsespongebob reference lol
this is powerful and sad man fake victim culture creates real victims as a so called black man i support this message
that dude just played himself lmao
this is so simple to not secure the boarders would be anarchy if you need an explanation why research the definition of government
37 of homicides are from illegal immigrants so are the other 63 from citizens  seems like we should dislike our citizens before we decide to dislike immigrants
boy i cant wait for the next governor of new mexico to start the xray checkpoint protocol
taxation is theft though and designed to keep people brainwashed into servitude if they can print trillions of dollars that we didnt agree to in the first place why must we pay taxes again thats right to be enslaved to debt btw this xray dude is on some kind of narcotics he kept sticking his tongue out lol
went from billions for a wall to trillions for a wall lmfao this guy
what a fucking tweaker
can i ask something not related to the wall just about immigration and illegal immigrants these debates only seem to be debating over the people who migrate to engage in illegal activities but what about the refugees who come here illegally because theyre fleeing a wartorn country but dont have the money or means to migrate legally like their only option is a crowded leaky sketchy boat out in the middle of the night that could have them drown but their country is so disastrous that theyre willing to take that chance to seek a better life for them and their families those people are many but in these debates theyre often forgotten i am kinda coming from a place of some ignorance im australian and all i know is our asylum seeker immigration laws are abysmal so part of this is a request to be educated on the us laws on this issue and the other part is wanting to know where these refugees fit into this kind of debate
ahahahaha the second dude had the best accent of all time and his ideas were mint lmfao
lol that look you gave at the ned was the same look i had the entire interview with mr xray border guy lmao
there are no words 
i cant even watch this
i know guys like the one in the white shirt who say they are spanish and not mexican  he is full of shit and ashamed of his own race eres un baboso sin cultura  se ve el nopal en tu frente
my issue is that people say physical wall 1 stupid waste of cash 2 cameras with heat vision and night visions with a distant post to drive to locations would be cheaper and software is at a level it can give you a decent facial image and setup to automatically notify security
if you think building the wall is gonna help slow down immigrants from crossing thru mexico then you dont know shit mexicans come here thru tunnels bro a wall makes no sense besides everyone in this country is a descendant of immigrants i repeat everyone in the usa comes from an immigrant even those blonde blue eyed white ppl unless you are native american in which case you can proudly say this is your country we americans just stole it from you
can we talk about that lady walking around with her plant 
what good is a wall if nobody is there to defend it it is the longest border in the world between a first world and third world country it is mountainous isolated and difficult to get to we have the largest military by far we should reel them in and use drones to patrol if the coast guard isnt a part of border security already honestly not sure it definitely shouldnt be limited to our coast lines by doing both we may not need to build a physical wall that may or may not be enough to deter the illegal immigrants they are a pretty determined lot to cross deserts on foot theyre not just going to get to the wall and turn back they will do about anything but we should have our military take care of it give asylum to those worthy deport those who are not and make the worthy ones citizens who will get jobs and pay taxes
can we agree that there are legal white citizens that dont want to pay taxes
to execute this id have to like a get a few mastermind individuals  unknown artist
i wanna be governor of new mexico lol
what surprises me is that people confuse the arguement wanting to enforce the law does not mean we dont like immigrants i too know that hispanics can be fantastic workers and when they legally immigrate they do give alot to our economy the only problem is when people come over and work and dont pay taxes because they arent citizens yet still get the healthcare benefits that our taxes cover the only thing i want is for them to get citizenship so that our country benefits and so that they benefit as well like besides taxes you get to vote and be elected to office everyone benefits when they go through the proper process
if we build a wallwe cant visit our familiesever heard of a plane lady
so make all the illegals legal make them do courses and them tax them ok well lets put to one side whether these illegals will pass these tests or not who the fuck is going to pay for these tests the hard working citizens of america and lets say they pass these tests what guarantee do we have that they will work so we can make money on them fuckin idiot
i dont agree with the wall but i agree illegals need to be legalized obviously if they have familys that are legal because of their crime then all of them should be deported those already here should get a warning and a date to get legal before deportationim not racist americas pay taxes or are supposed too illegals dont for the most part if i have to pay to be here and enjoy my freedoms they should too its not fair otherwiseand that was trumps stand when he stated about the wall
the guy from new mexico is a complete tool   talk about being a clueless idiot wow must be a democrat
the guy from new mexico is a complete tool   talk about being a clueless idiot wow must be a democrat
hmmmm the first argument against your wall is that the majority of illegal immigrants to enter the usa do not come from the border check the stats please and most of them who stay are staying because americans employ them as cheap labour i wouldnt be surprised if the wall will be built by them actually why waste so much money and effort to achieve so littlealso you know who you end up looking like dear wall supporters ever hear of the berlin wall so this is how far we have regressed applause
this was so painful to watch
this idiot wanna be governor wants every person on earth born to be implanted with electronic tracking devices  dumbass
build that wall and built it very tall
that mexican is living in 3018
holy cow the second guy is completely scatter brained he is absolutely fucking clueless kinda sad to see
that was such a strange argument how will xrays help if you arent limiting the spots where the border can be crossed
build the wall
maybe too many people agree with you
lol does that guy really think therell be no borders in 510 years he must be 21 or younger not to realize how short that is  reasonable insane people at least claim 4050 years out for things
its also effective if the united states charge and penalize mexico and other countries of origin for example charge 10000000 dollars per illegals to mexico and just add the same amount of tariff to their imported goods to the country then mexico and the other governments will get serious in preventing their nationals crossing the border
im spanish my familys from new mexico smh youre hispanic bud not spanish
im impressed with your preparations for these encounters so when you prepare do you consider what it would take to change your mind and do you look into it to see if you should change your mind
it sucks that the liberals can yell and protest about trump and say their appinion but when the pro trump people say their beliefs then we get beeten up or get shouted at and a bunch of hate crimetrump 2020keep that wall coming
sorry these people steven is talking to arent articulate enough to compel me to listen to them more than a minute their objections are all over the place so why bother id doubt that first woman ever voted and for some reason she thinks a wall would stop her from visiting people in mexico as if shes going to hoof it through the desert do her walls at home stop her from going outside no they just make her use the proper entrance and exit routes
we should buil a wall all around the united state mexico canada  do the job right and make a prison for american
statiscally 40 of white american citizens have mental illnesses and comit most mass murders than any other race
what a great topic to piss people off
this wasnt worth my time these are usually good entertainment but these guests are getting dumber
ah yes evidence of redlining at its best i must admit that i feel lucky that i was only subject to purposely poor education due to areas with higher property taxes and wealthier people somehow strangely having access to better education for the first 6 years you were given your education the rest of us were denied it only some of us escaped poverty to a certain extent if you were just given that right to a better life in order to effortlessly surpass all other ethnicities and yet you still have not become unbelievably successful and richthen youre a total dumbass lol hope that doesnt come back to haunt you
it will not happen the costbenefit calculations are showing that it would be a waste of money
that xray number pass code written whereabouts thing was disturbing something youd see in wolfenstein that guy reminds me of some dictator youd see in a farcry game
i like these videos a lot it is refreshing to see a space where people just want to have a civil discussion about relevant topics nonetheless it must be really hard to find people that can give you stadistics to support their arguments on the spot personally in regards to this topic building the wall would not stop people from coming in illegally for starters they are coming here because their own countries are facing dire circumstances and the government are not acting effectively to restore peace to stop them from coming the us would have to convince them that they either dont have a reason to come here or that they have a reason to stay in their country besides illegal immigration is already a very profitable illegal business which gives the smuggling criminals an incentive to find ways around the wall measure dig a tunnel under come prepared to climb it or blow a hole in it etc strengthening border security is a good idea but i do not think its realistic to expect border agents who are just as human as anybody else to monitor the entire expanse of desert wilderness 247 every day i was surprised to hear the argument of why dont we just let everybody come in but force them to pay taxes so they generate more revenue for the country its a fair argument if you are coming here you cannot expect us to take care of you
so ive been doing research on my own about where crowder is getting  illegal immigrants make up 35 of the population but commit 37 of the murders in this country there are many things wrong with this so in a previous video where he does a pro and con of trump he brings up this statistic too and reveals the source that he got it from was an article from the hill the article uses data from a federal study that takes a random sample size of 1000 criminal aliens in to make an estimate of all criminal aliens in the nation a study populations of 250000 they do this because there is no comprehensive nationwide crime statistical study available that include illegal immigrants in this study they estimate that 25064 illegal aliens were arrested of homicide it clearly says in the footnotes that an arrest does not mean a conviction crowder then takes this number of 25064  and compares to the number of homicides that were actually committed from 20052008 and comes to his conclusion of 37 i dont think you can go around so surely telling people that 35 of a population commits 37 percent of murder in the nation when the study is based on a sample size and not a comprehensive study not to mention that the sample is only meant to study the population of criminal aliens who were arrested for a crime and not the entire illegal alien community itself and they misinterpret the data and assume arrests are convictions this is absurd
yea some spic you pick that can barely speak english will change my mind hahahahhahhahhahahhahhahah
that interview hurt my brain
as a mexican with illegal family here we do not own him nor does he speak for us in general he is just a dumbass
dude at the end was a complete moron
steven is a beast love this guy
this guy is absolutely clueless he wants a system to document every immigrant with id tagsxrays but then says he doesnt want any borders whatsoever wtf are you even saying every single time when a simple stance on a subject is given to this people they do not address it they simply bring up other argumentsfeelings that have absolutely nothing to do with what was asked its like just answer the damn question with actual factsevidence is it really that difficult so many ignorant people in this country its scary facts  feelings
these shouting people are only a part of the problem and not the solution if they feel they have a point sit down at the table and share it
think of the wall as the walls of your house and the illegal immigrants are people trying to get into your house they will be incapable of entering without knocking on the door and being invited in unless they break that door down but then that would be an attack and would be like starting a war but would they really want to start that over security being beefed up
this future governor is thinking in 3018
ok ive seen a few of these now youre obviously smart and youre picking randos who are triggered by your signs debate someone who is prepared as you id love to see you vs john oliver or trevor noah
build the moat change my mind
508 haha everyone wants to be white
awww hes an idiot
white tshirt guy is literally retarded for lack of better words
the second guy started smart then got stupid real fast
shes right in that us mexicans will find a way into the us while im against coming illegal you also have to see why some do it they do it for a better life and actually help out the country but then theres the bad mexicans id say do deeper checks on them and grant citizenship to the good ones it might be impossible to do then theres the wall its basically going to be a waste of a shit ton of money that could be used in education for our veterans for the homeless and the poor
dude its simple just have superman fly up and down the boarder and use his xray vision to identify them
what the fuck are people talking about  is it a language issue  this is the most incoherent thing ive heard in a while
that guy from nm is a fucking maniac an xray border haha plans on being the nm governor he might be qualified who knows after all his family has been there since the 1550s
are these stevens actual opinions or does he pick controversial opinions to start a debate
stevens face at the end lmfao
why would you build a multi billion dollar wall that can be permanently defeated by a 50 ladderor a 10 shovel and an hour
wellas long as xray borders are scientifical
i break wallshttpsmyoutubecomwatchvbpeh1wdce0
xray with people chipped hes got no clue
damm that spanish guy was living on mars cause that fucker had some fucking technology ive never heard of
that guy is fucking hilarious
you all laugh but watch xray borders are the future just you wait man that future governor of new mexico is a genius
that 2nd guywhoa 
have you guys started building of the wall
that guy was definitely mexican
they cant cuz if they allow everyone to get citezen ship they will have to document it like he said but ten years from now they will call that rasisim
majority of illegals are hard working and dont break lawsif you are here illegally then youre breaking the law
no wall was ever worked 
he is just dumb enough to become governor
the last dude seems to not even know what hes talking about
is it just me or did that new mexico guy give me that my cat is an alien vibe edit i changed it from aliens are real because that wasnt the joke i was trying to get across
his face at the end says it all 
the wall is not the answer many immigrants are people who came legally with visa and decided to stay how do you think  immigrants have houses land bank accounts they pay taxes with number given by irs to become a us citizen you have to have a good education legal family members in us and be someone whose had a good stable job for years if we had all those then why come to the us in the first place all im saying if you were in the situation that a family member is dying because mexican hospitals wont help without money and you barely ate good you would do whatever to have a better future for your kids
we should deport all mexicans all at once so they the people of the united states realize that we need these people and the economy will go down why cause were doing things that american citizens will not do changemymind
do a part two in portland oregone i wanna speak with you haha and see peoples opinions on this in my city as well
spend trillions building the wall so that a democratic president comes and knocks it down lmao losers
lerooooooooy jenkins get back in the game 
walls are not good argumentwell mexico has a border with south america with walls but nobodoy complain about thatpeople want work and pay taxes argumentwell enter legaly to the country and do that there is a system where you can fill papers and get visa for workpeople need place to work and live argumentthey had all that on born country what ever is
yea over 400 million south americans they coming here wall still though so what then 
i just got an ad of one of ur vids
holy fuck that guy is like talking to a wall
so radio tagging transhumanist digital economy city dude with  you are being watched dystopianism mandatory signs and comment boxes saying why are you here what are you doing
i have a suggestion for crowders change my mind segments  if this can be adapted into the planning of these segments an attempt needs to be made to inform the public of your next topic and when and where the topic will be discussed it is apparent that crowder has done some research and often sites statistics in these discussions i encourage this and i appreciate the need to encounter unstaged unscripted live discussions on hot button topics however as the segments stand it creates an uneven platform for debate or intellectual insight since crowder comes prepared with information to backup his view on a topic while his subjects are responding on the spot with no time to defend their position when put on the spot and not given equal time to defend the subjects stance on the topic most people are programmed to respond in an emotional way it causes a meltdown in the conversation and continues to give crowder an upper hand it makes for decent entertainment but if the segment is designed to challenge crowders viewpoint on a topic and promote higher thought it falls short so give your participant crowd a chance at a more even playing field by allowing them to do their research and prepare for the next topic youll still get the emotionally charged crowd and the unsupported arguments in these segments keep the segments live and public to maintain the reality appeal but promote better intellectual debate by planning the time location and topic of your next segment so that your participants can better challenge your own prepared and researched viewpoint on these hot button topics
the blood line of the mexican has more ties to all throughout the americas amexem in particular than descendants of europeanschangemymind
white people should go back to england  this is not their land  it is ours native americans and mexicans
my family has lived in new mexico since like 1550 whaaat  he was american before america was a thing
traps are gay change my mind
future gov of nm  uuuhhhuhuh dumbass alert
priceless expression 1377
fuck your wall its not crowded with fucking muslims  like the netherlands
xd that would be a huge xray at the border almost like a wall
my main problem with the wall is the cost of it its flat out just not worth the cost and its actually going to do nearly nothing when it comes to stopping illegal immigration we talk about how more gun control wont stop the bad guys from getting guns and then spend 70 billion upfront and 150 million every year after for a wall that you could literally just buy a latter and get over its ridiculous illegal immigrants are going to come into the states pretty much no matter what in my personal opinion we need to simply just make the path to citizenship easier and more accessible to the people who want in that way they are at least documented accounted for and putting into the system via taxes
i fear for the safety of the first person who sat down  you only blurred her face and aired what she said  if any of those illegal immigrant criminals see this they will know who she is just by seeing her body and voice  they will harass her if not worse
holy shit that guy was retarded scientifical
xray guy makes my head hurt
haha that spanish guy is dumb as shit no fucking idea what he is talking about just get some xray and it wall be all cool
legalize marijuana to solve mexican border crime  change my mind
the second person seems to be proposing some sort of rfid chip
steven has the most insane patience 
we had a wall in germany didnt last very long but i wish nothing but the best to all american citizens affected by crimes of illegal immegrants that the wall will cure all your problems and a big thanks to everybody working hard and paying taxes to fund that projectamerica and its problems are truly entertaining trying to solve problems with massive buildings d
guy in the white shirt is kind of a moron eh
god this guy sounds dumb af
a wall wont work but lets tag and release everyone with chips so we can track them as they pass through our xray wall that will cost billions more than just a concrete wall that dude is beyond stupid
what was he on
building a wall is spreading more hate into an already hateful world this country was founded by liberals who did not like the way their world was they traveled here to make a new world illegally they slaughtered an entire group of people and almost made the buffalo go extinct through efforts to starve the native americans we are now trying to protect our new world the united states of america  by keeping people who have very horrible lives and want a new life for themselves out of our country it is hypocritical to say the least i think countries will one day thousands of years in the future say screw nations and screw our differences the world is made up of people and we should all be striving towards togetherness building a wall is a step backwards the world needs to be united we are striving to divide it i believe in love and in the common human struggle we are all trying to get through life and it feels like in the grand scheme of the world and everything beyond something as petty as a border should be a laughable topic of discussion of course its wrong to build a wall on many levels im sort of rambling but i just wanted to put my opinion out there because everyone else is thank you
definitely come in legally and the correct way but a wall would be pointless
im not accusing anything here but goddamn i hope this is cherry picked if that is an accurate representation of the average persons opinions on this matter then america is in real serious trouble im not even slightly condoning illegal immigration but building a wall seems like a horrible inefficient means of combating it its an enormous expense and most people in favor of it dont seem to realize that it isnt a one off cost maintenance is going to be a consistently substantial expenditure not to mention the fact that if it isnt effectively patrolled it is essentially useless as it isnt particularly difficult to obtain means of getting over a wall it isnt a cut and dry issue by any means but the practicality wasnt mentioned at all only the politics and emotions
i support the building of a metaphorical wall and i support immigration reform i do not support the building of an actual wall it only addresses a symptom not the root problembuilding a wall is bone headed and it feels a lot like doubling down on our current immigration policies which are completely broken i believe that the shadow economy created by illegal immigration is no accident and is caused by  policies designed to create an artificially cheap labor marketwell set aside for now the fact that most illegal immigrants are people who entered legally and have overstayed their visa status many people will agree that illegal immigrants should come here legally so the first thing we can do is to try and fix thatso the first question is how can we make it easier for immigrants to choose to enter the country legally instead of illegallythink about this why are people choosing to risk their life and spend thousands of dollars crossing illegally instead of using a legal alternativeis entering the us with the purpose of working legally that much  more difficult than entering illegally the answer is probably yesfor a person who chooses to cross the border illegally this is no small decision it commonly costs thousands of dollars to pay a coyote to be smuggled in literally risking their lives to come here and become an underpaid part of an underclass  the fact that people make this choice over legal immigration points to the fact that coming and staying legally is much more difficult if not impossible and in fact it is depending on the country the process of obtaining a visa is onerous expensive and not guaranteed i wont get into the details but its very hard expensive and time consuming its designed to only allow high skill foreign workers not unskilled laborers it seems like there is literally no other recourse for an unskilled worker from mexico to come here and just work if thats what they want to do then lets let themtimes have changed the economic reality is that we need this cheap labor in the market if all these people are coming and the vast majority of them are working then that means we need them so lets fix this howwe need to make coming into the country legally a much easier cheaper and safer alternative than crossing illegallythere are pros and cons to this approach but i think there are many more benefits than notthe debate should be about this because there are a lot of different points to be discussed it shouldnt be about how do we keep these people out but rather given the economic realities how do we let a lot more people in legally in an orderly fashion tldr we need a jobs visa program for unskilled laborers coming in the program should be designed to make legal immigration a better alternative to illegal immigration this would be far more effective than a wall which symbolizes a doubling down of the existing shit policies and does not acknowledge current economic realities
i prefer the change my mind segments where he talks to people who arent completely retarded
that crazy new mexican wants minority report fucking retard
what about uh  b o a t s
 arent most illegals ones that come with temporary visa and dont leave also dont most come by plane and boat vs actual walkingdriving across the border
does anyone buy the new mexicos guy story like really dude get your story straight im starting think this shit is staged  
ive met a lot of spaniards from new mexico lol
tax them  it is not a money problem it is a problem which is best described as a  cultural influx and stability problem in the absorption rate of new people  we should be caring about integration and weaving into all of our society new people as much as we do about controlling their numbers and status  the guy does sense the vision but if we dont work a lot more on all aspects of integration and amalgamation or absorption problems will keep arising the rate of absorption has to be higher than the rate of entrances if we want to heal and get rid of all related problems
i think it would be very useful to point out and underline strongly that the reason illegal immigrants from mexico and central america are committing so much of the crime in america is not because of the illegality of their migration itself but rather because of the fact when they come in avoiding the usual protocol time paperwork and money required to do things properly it becomes attractive to those who want an easy way out of the worst areas of the urban social conditions in those countries drawing from people who are already involved in crime and vice disrespect for their fellow citizens etc so what we need to be conscious of is that what we are trying to block above and beyond the illegal crossing itself is the population of society in those countries who will export their lack of morals and criminal lifestyles to our country
you need to end the welfare state end the drug war and end pointless wars overseas much cheaper than building and maintaining a wall and possibly more effective
i see the problem with the illegal immigrants but i do not feel like paying for this wall lol and i dont think mexico wants to either
why they having a hard time securing the border they seem to have an easy time to patrol and secure the area 51 border
why not just legalize and regulate the main reasons why most illegal immigrants from the south enter the us marijuana and other drugs items controlled by drug cartels take enough money out of the cartels hands and maybe the local police and governments in the south can fight against the corruption that fuels a lot of the exodus take enough money out of the cartels hands and they wont be able to keep the politicians in their back pockets because the revenue the governments receive is primarily from its citizens and not its illegal drug smuggling operations lead by the cartels maybe then these illegals or undocumented individuals could actually go through the correct procedures to enter the us legally without feeling like they needed to flee due to unsafe lifethreatening circumstances maybe given time the local governments police forces and citizens in the south can turn their communities into respectable places to live without fear of being executed for even simply just casting a vote or running in opposition to a knownalleged criminal who knows maybe then you might see a mass migration of us born fleeing to the south across a border that now mexico wants to build a wall on and thats how you get mexico to pay for the wall a wall that makes sense to some in theory but isnt the solution or end all be all    by the way i know legalizing drugs in the us isnt the only fix but its a start if alcohol tobacco and pharmaceuticals are legal attribute to many deaths a year and are regulated to some degree then why cant we do the same for at the very least marijuana at least theres no known cases of overdose deaths or cancers from marijuana which has way more positive uses than negative than alcohol tobacco and pharmaceuticals and illegal immigration to the us isnt strictly confined to mexico guatemala honduras  el salvador china and many other countries contribute to the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants currently residing in the us the fact of the matter is a wall only gives a sense of security and only bandaids a wider issue that the us faces from all sides of the globe im not saying that we as a country should just give up because the task at hand is great but why not at least try and implement measures that are not just one sided fixes
the second interviewee was high on dope
they should come here the right way i agree but building a wall isnt going to do anything but raise taxes i think its like 70 of illegal immigrants come to the us by plane so unless they can build a wall big enough to stop a plane not really going to do anything most of those illegal immigrants come here to visit family that are legal and they just dont go back they violate their visa and it actually takes a lot more than just a cop seeing you out theres channels you have to go through to get someone deported its not just hay hes illegal immigrant immediately deportation we need to hold the people hiring illegal immigrants and paying them low wages possible to work responsible thats where a lot of your problem is if they cant get work they wont want to come here that guy is  goofy as fuck lol
what the fuck is that guy saying
waste of  money ineffective not fit for purpose and just a bad symbol
35 of the population are undocumented immigrants they commit 37 of homicides building a wall directly affects mexico yet the 35 is made up of other nationalities who came into the country via your airport how is building a wall going to minimize this
i believe in no borders we should build an xray border wut 
a lot of people who come into this country dont want to pay taxes  well i guess most people born in that same country dont want to pay taxes either
that guy from new mexico sounded like he would want border security like half life but you need walls to enforce security like that if you had open borders with electronic scanners on roads people would just walk or drive around them not everyone wants to be monitored by the government especially those who do illegal things he aint all there is e
scientifical evidence
there are large holes in this mexicans ideas the problem is theres no way to regulate how many and who comes in and out and without that regulation we wont be able to document all of them the funny thing is what he is proposing is what we already tried but we cant trust the people because they abused the privileges
just get a bunch of frat boys at the border who do you know here
americans should be able to do whatever they want with their borders like all the countries around the world   at the end of they day its their country
in my opinion the wall is pretty stupid i leave within 10 miles of the bored alot of the farmers that live in that area have lost parts of their land because of it and the government gave them close to nothing for their property this wall is going thru farm land wild life sanctuary parks but people that dont live here dont know im not against making it more difficult to come in but thats the only thing the government could come up with a wall
this was too painful to watch
for me i dont believe we should build a big wall i dont think that would solve our problem sounds like a waste of money to me i do believe we should enforce immigration laws however
the infrastructure of what the second guy was talking about would cost so much to implement not to mention the totalitarian state it would create to enforce it
water isnt wet change my mind
i dont know what the second guy was using but i want some he seems to have a wide imagination ddd
dont build the wall because its environmentally destructive
they already have a scanner and xray check this guy obviously has never been to a border  and that lady right we need to make sure we know whos coming here
x r a y m a s t e r m i n d
im not really concerned about the idea of a wall its more about the financial side of getting that done that i have questions about people that are against safe borders arent affected by cartel violence like border cities are
but todays standards lol the whole be modern excuse
also this guy from new mexico not mexican but got the most chingon accent 
it is hard and dangerous for immigrants to cross the boarders illegally but they still do it because what they are running away from is even more dangerousnot saying let the usa be a freeforall but create programs that help those wanting to cross make it less impossible for them to actually gain a better lifeand yes you will always have negatives no matter who or where or whatbut lets try to objectively see all sides of the situations and make a nonbiased choice
there are already fences so whats the problem with a wall
this is retarded look fuck a wall if we some is here illegally an theyre caught they go to jail for a few weeks to study an get their citizenship if they dont wanna study or they fail send them back fuck it thy obviously dont really wanna b here if they cant pass a test
hilarious how she whispers and its put on youtube lol
migration  is he taking about illegal aliens or birds
why come legally when i can cross illegally and take your jobs 
deport that man
fact check from his 630 evidence they commit 37 of the homicides is wrong but i can quickly see why he reached this conclusion the cato institute published data showing convicted murderers per 100000 people 31 is the rate for us born 26 is the rate for undocumented and 1 is the rate for documented well if you sum these up it equals 67 per 100000 26 is indeed approximately 37 the problem is i think he read it wrong and just bear with me please if you closely analyze the data you will reach a way smaller percentage when you translate the rates to the estimated population of the country26 of 100000 undocumented are convicted with 12000000 in this country only about 312 actually murder in 1 year so 31 of 100000 citizens are convicted with 300000000 in this country about 9300 actually murder in one year now if you compare 312 vs 9300 312 is not even close to being 10 of the nationwide murders articles are hard to understand and easy to misinterpret your 37 is a false reflection so i hope you dont use it anymore thank you to those who read all of it
that first kid in the white shirt is an idiot lol he was definitely on something haha he even said id have to sit down with people and think soberly
so an xray border
why are some people so sincere but so sincerely deluded the second guy wants no borders then when 150 million impoverished uneducated not versed in american customs rights etc people from south of the border are here what type of country does he think it will be it will be a hell hole like the one they ran form america is america  because of the people who founded it and created it when the anglos and other white eiropeans become a minority the level of civilization will drop look around the world whites created this relative compared to  the rest of the world paradise other peoples have created dysfunctional hell holes fact
did anyone else feel like they got dumber after listening to the fucking guy omg
you cant really have an intelligent and meaningful conversation with a leftist on any subject whether its about border security healthcare global warming the second amendment or whatever the subject may be and heres why when you hit them with proven facts and numbers their go to line iswell i dont agree with that in other words to them facts dont matter because they dont like the fact because it destroys their agenda it doesnt matter if you agree with it or not the truth is the truth but then again they are interested in truth either because they are famous for saying my truth so good luck having an intelligent conversation with that kind of mentality
love crowders wtf was he rambling on about look at the end 
love crowders wtf was he rambling on about look at the end 
crowder interview some people that are worthythis is cheap clickbait
im not am cheap prickim just a prick
wish he wouldve found ppl who were more informed
what the fuck is that guy on hahaha
hell yeah build the wall borders are  gonna be a thing of the past roflmao   what a idiot
even though i may not agree with some of your view points these change my mind episodes are really interesting and enjoyable to watch
wow what a moron this is the problem nowadays we have so many people that have no idea what theyre talking about but theyre vote matters
its like automobile insurance  give them a path of citizenshipput a tracker on them how you would a vehicle  a pet or soemthing and let them achieve citizenship by good behavior
lets tag and release the illegals is that what spaniard saying  i am for it we can make it into a sport all money we can make for the sport will go to building the wall

what was that look steven at the end of the video haha
man that dude wanted some orwells 1984 shit
you didnt blurr her id badge just saying
ok its hard as shit for people to come here legally just keep that in mind
in regards to the guy who said about the x ray scanners on the border i think it would be a better idea as paying by card is becoming dominant over paying in cash it would be a better idea to have some form of id allowing you to buy things with which also informs an international database of the country you are in
hes talking about a holocaust type of code where you are just a number a dehumanizing way and utopian way of thinking its creepy and he wants them to be implanted with tech to track them
a massive xray is not the answer theres a reason you have a huge lead sheet thing on your chest when youre being x rayed
i lost several iq points listen to the second guy
this was hard to watch
jeez this was not a productive episode xd
900  who taught this guy english  pastuh fastuhgeeezus
this guy that said he was spanish cuz his family has been in new mexico since 1500s telosico bruh new mexico was mexico at one time hence the name so your family was mexican at one time or another and you have mexican culture so you are delusional if you think youre only from spain my family came from spain in the 1750s and mixed with the people here in texas and mexico im mestizo and so is he so him thinking hes just spanish is just plain stupid
do you have a illegal fire arm no its just undocumented
this man that was interview3d is a fucking idiot
and maybe the border patrol can have zero point gravity lasers that come from their finger tips and anti gravity boots haha i seriously hope this fool never runs for governor of anything
xray scanner lol his idea isnt completely bad except it needs actually needs a wall in order to work
he wants to microchip human beings
the second guy interviewed wants everyone chipped idiot
keep educating these poor globalist souls
that guy must be high as fuck  his arguments went all out sci fi
build the wall america protect your country we need a president like trump here in france and we also need to quit the european union
you had no people who wanted to talk with you that means they want the wall too simple as that
this guy is a complete idiot  no seriously i think hes got an iq of about 80  its the leftist indoctrination and so obvious  no borders lol  just shows how young people that get brainwashed early will be the ones to destroy this country  he really thinks you can keep a lid on people paying taxes without a border  good grief
says his family has been here since the 15 hundreds but speaks broken english and makes absolutely zero sense cant make a half a valid point i call bull shit uneducated welfare rat dependent of the state
the first guy looks like hes on meth
yeah like idiocrazy lol
rockin slider vans while being racist is a no no bro 
how did we get from lets not build a wall to lets make an xray wall to i dont know im thinking about becoming the governor of new mexico  
invest the money that it would cost to build a wall into better border security a wall isnt going to do much most of the drugs brought into the united states are brought through tunnels or through the air as far as immigration mexican people and other latinoshumans are smart just as americans are they will figure out a way to get past the wall
guy from new mexico is so confused and misinformed its sad bc majority of ppl think like this
a wall costs 10 million a ladder costs 50 a shovel costs 20 costs are just an example to make a point
this comment may be perceived as one against the wall but understand that its main goal is to make aware the costs associated with a border wall compared to other measures such as just hiring more border agents  i understand the arguments from both sides and realize that illegal immigration isnt a light subject and im for controllingeliminating illegal immigration     its already been researched and found that building a wall is going to cost two to three times more than what was first proposed of 1015 billion dollars not to mention the upkeep of that wall over the years which is estimated at about 750 millionyear for an entire border wallcurrently the wall already in place 650 miles  costs about 290 millionyear if you minus the current wall already in place and just build a wall where there isnt one the percentage of cost per mile goes up if you still use 10 billion  and just because you build the wall doesnt mean you get rid of border control agents altogether so you have to take that cost into account as well  i will only use the cost of the walls construction on the low end for the entire 2k mile expanse and the cost of border control agents per year to determine if a wall or hiring more border control is better in the long run     the usmexican border is roughly 2000 miles long at a 10 billion cost that is 5 millionmile the average salary of a border control agent ranges between 36k70k per year with the median average being about 50kyear so if we take the median average salary and divide that into the cost of the wall per mile we get 100 that means for only one year you could have 100 border control agents per mile of border or 200k border control agents monitoring the border over that year100 agents multiplied by 2k miles thats 10 times the amount of current border control agents that monitor both the mexican and canadian borders with 86 of agents currently monitoring the mexican border per year that 200k is also more than current enlisted us marines in the military           the 10 billion cost is in addition to whats already being spent currently on border control you could for that cost of the wall hire 10k more border control agents at 50kyear for 20 years10 billion divided by 10k agents divided by 50k ive already stated that the current number of agents monitoring both borders is about 20k with about 86 of them or 17k that monitor just the mexican border at current numbers that means that there is roughly 9 agents per mile of mexican border if you just add 10k agents that would bring that number to 14 agents per mile per year for the next 20 years i understand that theres 24 hours in the day and work shifts associated with that 24 hour period with a typical 8 hour shift thats adding nearly 2 extra agents per shift per mile for 20 years that means better safety for the agents in place due to more agents on hand that means more eyes on the ball every day and night for 20 years quick fact on the more eyes on the ballan individual can see at least 3 miles into the distance and that is only obstructed by the curvature of the earth at ground level with no eye defect that number is increased greatly when elevated for instance in a guard tower with or without binoculars       in the end when you look at just the cost of building an entire wall from scratch on the low end  compared to hiring more agents for the next 20 years it would be better to just hire more agents you might argue what happens after that 20 years do we just not have agents anymore remember that the 10 billion is in addition to whats already being allocated for border control plus the additional cost of upkeep not required over that 20 years which would be with current numbers proposed 15 billion theres also technology thats currently being used like drones satellites sensors and so on that help in controlling immigration the tech side of it all will only improve over that 20 year period and may reduce the number of agents required to monitor but the tech military defense budget the current number of military forces in countries not needed and so many other things could be argued or at least brought into the conversation in regards to this subject but again thats not what this is about i welcome any additions or contradictions to this comment and hope that you can change my mind that a border wall is not the only answer            note this comment does not take into account inflation wage increases and the like all numbers derived in this comment were found through easy research from multiple locations to ensure consistency as much as possible if you would like to know exact numbers then please fell free to research them yourself and compare the sums
xray border
oh my god xray scanner i cant watch anymore sorry
holy shit yeah the second guy wants us all tagged and chipped with an app on our phone to get over the border
he said we shouldnt have borders and then said we should ask them questions at the border 
that stupid second guy says i am not mexican i am spanish  gtfo dipshit
i have been studying the issue of a southern border wall for many years now i grew up going to mexico for 34 years in the summer to my grandparents vacation home in baja 19672001what a wonderful magical incredible place mexico is with that said i believe i have to agree with democrats and liberals about not building a wall on the southern border with mexico their argument against a wall is quite legitimate and factual they claim the wall is too expensive unnecessary and racist democrats believe people will chose not to cross our border inspite of no wall analysis of that beliefby having an open border people from anywhere and everywhere will come into the united statespeople we dont know people from communist nations socialist nations religious fanatical nations war torn and broken nations corrupt nations questionhow long do you think it would take with that kind of massive influx of people to completely change everything about our government and our  freedoms in america  not long america would slip into an abyss of lawlessness oppressive rule anarchy and or socialismcommunism despots will rule crime would skyrocket to levels above and beyond the wild west years it will become so dangerous so horrible and so prohibitive so fast that people will never migrate to the usa or whatever its being called at that timein essence illegal immigration legal migration and travel to america will completely stop the democrats are correct about the southern border wall proof of my analysiscanadaukdenmarksweedenbelgiumgermanyfrancethanks for listening  its this   the us constitution  or we will be ruled by this            
what amazes me is that the exact same principles most of these people live by every day in their lives becomes evil on this issue in other words i bet 99 ofanti wall and open border peoplelock their front door lock their car doors every night and i also bet 99 of them would say yes i lock my house so that i always know who is coming in and is there but i love inviting people over and having dinners hosting them giving them a ride if they need it etc i just dont want them coming into my house when i dont know about it and just taking food out of my frig or borrowing my car and i have no ideathat is a common sense principle for almost all americansyet seen as an hatred principle for the country itself just because i wont let you come into my house and eat any time you want doesnt mean i wouldnt gladly invite you over when im there and open the door for you myfather niecetwo newphews brother in law and a number of other people went through the process to get hereso the only reason you think i could be for border security and not letting people whosnuck in or over stayeda visaisbased on hatred of skin color can you possibly see another reason especially sincemy family is from africa
reminds of megadeths album cover for endgameholy fuk holy fuk holy fuk holy fuk
he just said  electronic id tagholy shit ive heard lots that it was going to come from the republicans but the left wing are what it seems like proposing the id tagsnot enough space on this to express the levels of holy fuks there is
when the guy said xray he knew he didnt know the exact way do discribe his idea he isnt dumb he just didnt know he was looking for the term rf not xray ignorance does not equal stupidityi do find it amusing that he would be against a wall and for what sounds like a tracking system if there is no wall how would they be forced to go through a scanner he was proposing
i disagree i watched a video by collagehumor about this topic and i went online and checked the information from multiple sources the wall wouldnt actually stop anything most of the illegal immigrants are already here the wall would also cost more than 15 billion dollars the wall would also take forever to build and too much money to maintain also if were still talking about the immigrants coming here then they will be able to simply fly over the wall i only used information here that i checked to make sure was true but still if im wrong someone feel free to correct me and cite your sources
the on subject of the xray border lol a funnel  a place to have people to walk threw to be accounted for makes sense but a wall seems too berlinesk like we might as well be on the scale of korea north and south border people are in fear of being separated from familyif deported   now if you take that fear away the fear of being deported people would be more inclined to register if your picked up by the cops walking across the wilderness of the border your taken to a facility and you are registered and put into the system if you dont live there and are a citizen of mexico they contact and say this person is registered and your citizenship is told to the other endmexico athorities  if you have a summer home in texas and a winter home in mexico and are a registered person in both countries  getting through would he no problem there would be no reason to hide or climb the wall if you will when you wouldnt be met with violence and or shame or jail time there is no reason to hide keep the tests hell make them kinda easier 23 of americans probably wouldnt be able to pass it to be honest lol but the point is take away the fear  and these people will do whatever they want to do say a man wakes up planning to get into america today  he would go to the border facility  background check physical  insanity test whatever you want and if he passed then he would wait 810 buisness days in mexico and receive a package that has his social drivers license or regular id  birth certificate all that stuff  and could then freely cross where ever  at the border he would like if a registered citizenof mexico and america wanted to cross to america in the technical since illegal way and gets caught then they can run his name and social and see he is a regular citizen and apparently a very weird person and picked a weird spot to cross if they pick up someone who is not a registered citizen they get them registered deported and sent the the border to take their tests and see if they pass or dont pass and if they dont there should be a 3 strike rule and after that they are deported and given a  30 60 90 180 day arrest for the offense when done multiple time  and if your caught bringing drugs its 2 strikes and the sentence would be in years first offense 1 year for say 1 pound of cocaine  or they can just be charged off the amount and type of drugs by the laws that are set in there designated country we still police the invisible border and deport the unregistered people but do it more civilly and give them a chance to escape the poverty they live in or violence on there family they should have no fear for wanting shelter and safety or a possibly better life in general
35 percent causes 37 percent of homicides can anyone point me to these statistics if they are real
i wanna talk to him right now about this topic right now

would love to see trump propose a mine field instead
go green global
jesus is god change my mind
how is anyome that stupid mayor governor dipshit
hell yeah let the american ppl pay for some pass code shitwhos gonna rustle these brown critters up and tag em
you should do one of these supporting a liberal agenda on a college campus  see how many free thinkers cant figure it out   sort of like when someone pitched trumped tax plan and labeled it as bernies and they were all for it until they found out the real origin
question for crowder  instead of a 2000 mile long wall what about a 2000 mile long chain link prison style barbed wire fence  would it be cheaper price tag
where can i get that sweater
he was so clueless no walls but chip everyone for tax purposes scanners dumb ass
white shirt guy needs to go back to 2nd grade and finishits scary to see just how dumb people can be these same people smoke weed and drive cars
drugs is a problem and border needs secured  wall will help administer it effectively the border security can better work towards eliminating this evil by uprooting itcoming to illegals  the countries that they are coming from should be co ordinated and they should change their policies to help them live better if their regime is brutal causing mass refuge  then usa should intervene and help build homes shelters for them in their own countries and their countries will be enriched and people from other countries want to immigrate to mexico or latin america for better opportunities
has anyone heard of operation backyard brawl its an organization of veterans that found and secured a coyote child sex camp and the media has done everything they can to supress any word of it getting out it has ties with the clinton foundation and needs to be made public
can i sign up to be a mastermind individual 
build the fucking wall and lock that bitch hillary in a cage merica
change your mind the wall is not to keep people out i  to keep you in
one of the major controversial issues facing the construction of the wall is not the fact that people will be deported trump has even said himself that if the people who are sent back across the border want to return they are more than welcome to come back but they need to do it the legal way to analyze a proposal like this requires a lot of thought into what the construction of a wall would consist of for starters there are homes on the us  mexico border that sit partially in mexico and partially in the us just how some homes are built in multiple states sc  nc being a prime example to construct the wall those homes could not be picked up and moved they also couldnt and wouldnt place a notch in the wall to accommodate houses so now you have us citizens who are going to lose their homes in concept of a giant wall the other issue payment who is going to pay for the construction of an estimated 70 billion wall homeland estimated 216 billion to construct it not including maintenance which was projected to cost 150 million a year not to destroy hopes here but that is a big issue the us is broke in debt and running on fumes the debt has not gotten better at all trump said several times that mexico would pay for the construction of the wall but the president of mexico had made it clear several times that this cannot and will not happen mexico is poor too with over 500 billion usd worth of debt while much lower than the us they only have a population of roughly 112 million citizens so who does that leave who can the government charge to raise enough money to build a wall the answer is pretty simple all of us taxpayer dollars would go towards a bill that bill would be used to pay the costs and then tax increases would happen across low and middle class citizens to maintain the repair costs and maintenanceall i am saying is right now the us has a lot more to be worried about i agree that illegal immigration is an issue but have we really stopped and thought about why they dont take the legal path perhaps its flawed perhaps it takes too long the list of reasons i can imagine vary but america needs to observe itself before jumping into years of construction that would cost us more than most large city developments to add fruit to this tree though if the wall is truly happening use the wall as a power network for clean energy solar would be reasonable start a trade network with mexico to supply clean power offer it to each state along the path of the wall and encourage sales as more revenue is made from the kw per hour charges put it back into the wall to maintain it you are talking about a lot of money there
im a cheap prick but have a complimentary algorithm comment and thumbs up
a physical wall isnt going to stop people from coming in
retard in the white shirt thinks illegals will just line up to pay taxes and get citizenship illegals dont want to pay shit they stay under radar on purpose and all money they make from the jobs they send the money home to whatever country they are from these people dont give a shit about contributing to the us and no one understands that
crowders stare into the camera at the end priceless
the second kid is an idiot  he means well but hes absolutely clueless  he is so in over his head its sad
so i legit dont understand the whole build the wall idea and i really want some sort of input of the pros and consi just want to have my ideas challenged here so to me its not about the side show statistics such as who are criminal or what is legal as more of what is more piratical and how hypocritical it is that we are discussing only a wall on the south side of the county also airplanes and boats are a thing and i dont think you can build a wall into the ocean feels sorta like east and west berlin i think having better foreign policy with at least people in the same hemisphere seems more beneficial then a wall but i dont think that will happen with any administration in my life time we have a long history of failing in foreign policy and i dont have any hope when it comes to that changing
new mexico citizen is clueless on border security
this hurts to watch cause of how stupid people are and i feel bad for new mexico if that guy ever becomes the governor
theres already a wall
mastermind individuals omg lol
as a liberal democrat i must say im happy mr crowder has a platform im not a blind loyalist who tries to deny the liberal bias in modern day msm and i support a conservative platform that gets the opposite message across i do disavow the ignorant people who walk by and yell profanities and immoral remarks as it only fuels the oppositions support and extends the argument that liberals get offended by anything that opposes their views and values people need to sit down for educated conversations and understand the disagreements and opposite view and why its there not just dismiss it as racism or bigotry im still waiting on a tv show thats a political version of the show undisputed on fs1 where say youd get steven crowder and bill maher to debate topics everyday of whats going on in america i feel like that could give a much better input on the country and peoples views i know stupid rambling but i felt like this needed to be said from a snowflake liberal like me
a wall wont stop nothing i mean look at the berlin wall great wall of china jurassic park and i mean every wall is built to be destroyedall im saying is that it will be nothing but a waste of money a wall wont stop nothing
forget the wall lets build a space age x ray scanner holographic laser beam to monitor people coming in and out
is it just me or did yall could see steven losing some iq points while talking to the newmex dude
that future governer cant keep a single train of thought for more than 5 seconds
build the wall
here is a question  crowder  how many illegal aliens get fake socials to work  how many of them pay into the system and do not collect refunds at the end of the year   now what is this not paying taxes deal  the illegals i see here  get work  income taxes are deducted who  are you referring to not paying  the fruit stand guy  the ice cream man   who are you referring to 
what a dumbass kid saying the shit hes saying and he actually believes his own bullshit and lies that hes been spoon fed   of course the elites are paying for the illegals to be here so they can keep the high paying jobs and rest of america poorits the perfect way to enslave the middle and poor class permanently   look at californiawhy the fuck you think the governor there abolished reading and writing and basic math for the stateto bring in and house millions more of illegalsno standards no problemin fact the governor is completely okay with banning the bible   talk about fucked up
bro i was really looking forward to this video and was so dissapointed with your competition i really feel like you didnt challenge yourself at all on this topic lmao i would of given you a better argument not necessarily saying i would change your mind though
us already have everything the man says theyre saying build the wall because no illegal immigrants are using the door why does every one not get that theres literally a door at the wall theres a fking door
i for one am against building the wall and only for the reason that the money that will be spent on that could be well spent on other beneficial projects for the government but again i dont want any illegal immigrants coming inso what are other alternatives to prevent them other than a wall
okay heres the thing i dont think we should build a wall its kinda expensive and a physical representation of what people can put their hate towards we could simply privatize border control with the use of drones which is waayyyy cheaper ya so my problem mainly boils down to the financial portion of the wall
100 of illegal immigrants have committed a crime its in the name
does he really hold every stereotypical conservative viewpoint 
geez this second guy i am getting massive second hand embarrassment the longer he continues to ramble
maybe an easy pass leroy
just let them in and give them a barcode tattoo
lol you shouldnt be posting videos destroying the mentally disabled
so let me get this strait its bad to build a wall but good to scan people and move them through the country like cattle the saddest part of that interview is that guy gets to vote
smoke meth much kid
broooooo stop talking omfg 
change my mind white europeans took hold of this land called america thru legitimate means they never did anything immoral or crooked to possess this land change my mind mr crowder
wall just got 10 ft higher change my mind
my family came in new mexico in 1550 im not mexican im spanish lol 
fuck we thought the concrete border wall was spendy not sure what that xray border would cost lol
only in this country could people with such a low iq still have clothes food and even their own camera
so what are the real benefits of this wall  im 100 mexican and live in mexico and i really have nothing against this wall people in mexico dont care about a wall mexican immigrants dont care about a wall majority of the immigrants migrated to the usa in much simpler waysamerican economy is important around the world if the price for a dollar rises things all over the world change and many are impacted this being said is it really worth it does america have 15 billion dollars available as spare change how is this even an investment  how does the usa get its money back i can assure you that there are at least a million different things this money could be better spent from mexico with love viva mexico cabrones
i wish i could sit next to him and actually have a smart conversation the people in this video are honestly not the smartest and im sorry to say that but any smart reasonable person can see that he said he planned on one day being the governor of new mexico  lol please  i dont support the wall but damm some of the people that im siding with make us look so stupid is like they go off and support things based on their feeling and not actual facts if there is any way i would like to know where and how i can sit and talk to you about this subject  dont know if you would ever see this comment im sure i cant change your mind because i feel like your mind is made and trust me sometimes i feel like i can totally see your point of view but im sure i can make you see some valid points of why such an expensive wall wouldnt work im sure i can also make you see my point its just hard to control immigrant in general cant say all immigrants come here to make this country better because most of the people who even decide to come here illegally come from areas of low poverty and sometimes with that comes ignorance
good example of how to lobby someone1 be prepared having stats to back you up even if they are wrong majority of the walk ins wont be able to check if they are real or not or be as prepared anyway2 put in caveats ie i am against illegal immigrants i want to protect our borders etc if you say anything else then we dont believe in the same thing and you cant convince me no matter what you way if you say you believe in the same thing you fall into the trap of trying to fight someone on their own terms3 irritate the other talker as much as possible till they cannot form reasonable arguments there is a reason in a proper debate there are time limits starting and ending speech etc in this case well you are holding the mic so you have the power to interrupt whenever you wantat the end of the day these videos looks cool but wont change anyones mind
this change my mind is ridicilous
so in this instance my issue is the small nature of the wall idea as a solution itd be way cheaper and more effective to put up solar powered drone ports along the border that patrol 247 no matter the weather then the border agents can be called to the precise location of these insurgents and no matter how dark or how well they hide theyd be easily visible and simple for the drones to follow you could get a little silly and equip them with tasers and nets and just notify their government of the location of their fleeing citizens
this new mexico guy is next level autistic is he seriously suggesting we require people to have ids that are constantly gps tracked by the government to recognize when they cross a nonexistent border he said scientifical holy shit this guy is a moron steven i dont know how you controlled yourself i would have laughed this boy back to elementary school
lol your race dose not matter  its not about race  yes mexico is in the light so if you uneducated u just think its about racism   what its about is making our country safer whats a country without borders anyways i mean you cant hate on people because mexico is supplying pretty much all the damn drugs to our country and killing off people left and right if you listen to whats being said in this video and what our president is trying to achieve i mean we should all want to not have to support people who want to live here on food stamps and just pocket every single dime they make and not give back and be selfish freeloaders so lets be clear its about legal immigration doing it the right way so if you do it the wrong way you are supporting stealing from hardworking americans and you deserve to be deported i dont give a crap how old you are or how long you lived here because you are a criminal so again its not about race its about choosing to break the law or respect it at the end of the day and if you dont respect our laws why be here in the first place i full faith our president will continue onto another term and complete his tasks at making are country great
come on man you know there are better arguments than this but i guess it was easy for youto make your stupid wall  build i guess you have an agenda too started watching your program thinking that you really want to debate but when you put this kind of content up you show your true colours shame  im disappointed 
leroy omg a bar code maybe a chip inserted into their arm and a large scanner then tax them were going to have to pay attention to new mexicos governors race for the next 20 years to see if leroy gets elected 
an xray machine placed at some random place because there would be no wallborder that all those desiring to enter the us would voluntarily pass through yeah right i never heard of go green global but knowing leroy represents them i dont need to find out anything further about them
as always way to know your statistics you just cant argue statistics
im telekinetic change your mind
your videos help me get through my super liberal university classes on the daily
a mi me la pelan los pinches gringos
this fool is terribly misinformedratchet
wtf is that man saying 
this guy sounds ignorant as fk
lol crowders face at the end had me dying
there is already a wall they are just making it better so the whole focus on the wall thing is bogus
maybe you should blurr her watch badge and bag as wellquite easy to identify her if the people shes afraid of watched this videohard for strangers but for people who know its easy
xray wall lol cancer for all
people should come here legally but why build the wall only across the mexican american border why not all around the usa so we can feel super protected from all sides build them all sky high woooo merica
this dude advocating basically chipping people and keeping tabs on them with checkpoints and centralized scanner hubs thinks a wall is just too dystopian rofl
this dude really wanted to record himself getting logic raped
a physical wall is silly it wont work its too expensive it is an environmental and a logistics nightmare there are better ways to accomplish the goal1 it wont work coyotes habe a huge business they will absolutely be able to find a way around a physical wall also two months ago illegal entry by central and south americans was greater through the canadian border than the mexican border2 the billions could be used in a far more effective manner by investing in technologies to create an electronic wall satellites drones and thermal cameras could be used to effectively shut down foot immigration 3 a physical wall can and will inhibit migrating species from their natural migration paths some species will likely suffer and might go extinct since all nature is a balanced web entire ecosystems might be destroyed4 logistics  it will never work why we already tried it we already failed to build a physical wall you need to use the police power of eminent domain george bush jr commissioned 600 miles of  fencing along the southern border fence not a wall a much easier and smaller goal they eventually have up and amended the law in favor of more electronics why you have to understand that the land where the border is located is owned by americans and mexicans also it isnt a straight line as it looks on the map it zigs and zags in and out of both countries so they have to have a hearing for every owner on both sides before they can take the land for public use this process proved so difficult and expensive the bush administration have up on it also the rio grand a large portion of the border is legally defined by a massive river like all natural rivers it changes width and borders often so as much as we like to think of the border as being a clearly defined line that line actually changes the only way to fix this is to build a massive canal to control the flow like they did with the la river only at a scale hundreds of times bigger this part alone would take decades a physical wall as trump has promised is a ridiculous ideaforget the wall the issue here isnt the wall its illegal entry the smart solution is multitiered  first  fix the immigration system legally we need the workers they need the work make a special visa program that lets them in with certain conditions also address the massive legal catch 22 with the current immigrants a path to citizenship seems excessive to me especially for someone who technically did something illegal but there should be a path to something 2 you must work with the governments of the countries where the immigrants are coming from if their own people dont fix things the issue will never end3 invest in a tech wall digital means are cheaper than ever and computers could do a lot of the work a grid of satellites drones cameras airplanes etc would actually be cheaper provide better jobs actually create a deterrent not to mention that an electronic wall will have a much lower impact on the environment  be able to move with the river and likely create a more effective deterrentall this typing is mutebecause i know a physical wall will never happen anywayits just a talking point to rile up dummies
the spaniard was a effing idiot
not worth the money  immigrants should not be allowed to enter illegally but they find loopholes anyway  money can be spent on better issues
 a small percentage is bringing in drugs lol umm ever herd of the mexican drug cartel you know the ones that control mexico
as an german i can definitly tell you a wall isnt something you need  wanna have 
can you do a part 2 on this topic the people that had a conversation werent really well educated on the full topic also this was one of your shortest change my mind video and i feel like this topic wasnt well discussed
so simple jus put a comment box at the border so they can say why their here lol stay in school kids
so everyone is okay with an invisible line called a border but as soon as you put a physical border its bad
when i grew up with mexicans immigrants and their kids all sold drugs its like their born into destroying america then they all have 5678 kids crying about 50 dollars  for child support selling all that dope living on welfare this country sucks   its filled with stupid lazy immigrants
just tax them i mean we might as well make some money off of them
a 30 ft wall or a wall of lead your move
very scientifical conversation
xray gate 2019
who knew that the solution to illegal immigration was right under our noses the whole time  just build an xray wall
i would like to see this guy debate someone whos an actual expert ive partially watched a few videos already and all the debates have been horrible to say the least he obviously knows what hes doing and he has strategy but what if he went against someone that had actual strategy as well
xray borders and rfid tags inserted in your arms incoming i feel a wall seems less scary 
the guy from new mexico seemed like he was high or just dumb or both
500 taxing the illegals  lol thats why u apply for a work visa u dumb negroid
funny how man thinks the dirt beneath his feet is his man is brief even a million generations of man is brief compared to the dirt beneath your feet
need to put ex governor jessie ventura on this subject with you crowder
im hispanic and i fully support the wall being built but it could also cause some harm to the environment
r32 at 700
leroy is 100 certified mexican
hell be lucky got be governor or mcdonalds in new mexico
lmao waht a narc
the second dude seems a bit tweeked out
what that man is describing doesnt sound like something  that mexican people would be down to do but thats just my opinion  they might be open to it but i really think that sounds appalling to talk about doing to your own people treating them like a herd of cattle thats what i see your trying to say
hes right we dont need walls cuz we live in a prison cell with inviable walls connected to chains we cant see
the wall represents hatred  racism segregation thats the problem with it building the wall wont change anything unless you make tougher laws
you mean like rifd chips and google darpa being able to track our movements with our phones a new world order ai tracking our thoughts and our movements
im all for immigration reform but at no time in history has building a physical wall worked it seems like such a simple answer to a very complicated question
the spanish guy with the camera said he wants scanners that keep tabs on immigrants which sounds more extensive then a wall they just dont like the idea of a wall and thats just because of the way the idea of building a wall was presented incorrectly by trump just ignorance all over america its kinda getting annoying
pay day comes and checks get cashed at the check cashing place  send money back home and no money goes to taxes  need food stamps no problem the instructions are in spanish
645 wth is your source for this
if you can drink a drink you can also eat an eat change my mind
if this is the philosophy of our next generation of leaders we are in serious trouble folks
dude that second guy was just wow
if the wall wasnt so expensive then sure biuld it
is verry dum that last guy
oh my god 
the mexican kid is so naive its so cringe watchinglistening
this moron  from new  mexico am spaniard    dude your  accent  is from guatemala  funny
i wonder how liberals will think if people have to have barcodes scanned into them
i am against illegal immigration but i still think the wall is stupid we can control the borders without a giant wall besides you can pass through the side with a boat in california or texas but i do however believe that if you come into the us you need to be accepted into our country no walkins
absolute bullshit stats  he is tricking people to come into an argument who he knows arent informed enough to contest his bs stats
every other country in the world has borderswhy not us
its a waste of money yeah you need secure borders but ladders and tunnels and boats exist theres no border or border patrol on the canadian border many people are going over there to come through the wall will end up like the unused stadiums that were built for the olympics
oh god xray border really what are these people thinking about
uh what
the first lady said maybe im confused yes maam yes you are
the only downside is that it costs a lot of money but other than that its a good thing
i never do this but crowder was bitchin about you people  youtube then magivcaly i get an add talking about building a hotel in space i dont watch space vidoes and i dont travel i build cars for a living and for a hobby that being said pay for my schooling and ill write better code in 3 monthsyou bitched weak come at me mrhateshisjob
wow i have no words that guy
wow this is the 4th video ive seen of this series and i cringe in embarrassment for the people who had such weak arguments in this one   especially that xray border future governor guy  yikes
im hispanic and i support there being some type of enforcement  level and the wall but some of you are just racist psychopaths geeeez these comments 
this guy is proposing an electric id tag xray tracking system for borderless societies aka the mark of the beast for the christians watching 
dont build the wall because we wont be able to watch the mexicans getting blown to bitswhen they step on the mine  field on the borderbut this xray guy has been reading to many superman comics
lol xray boarder
steven does not even consider changing his mind  change my mind
i dont like these videos steven crowder is clearly more prepared then any person passing by i feel that no true dialog can take place this way he should have discussions with people that are prepared and have statistics i feel steven  does this on purpose because someone prepared would clearly discredit stevens argument
lmao your face when dude walked away 
countries need a boarder otherwise there is no country its just a bunch of land from sea to sea to sea to sea i am for a wall just pay for it yourself now if united statesman were boarder jumping into mexico at alarming rates then im sure mexico would split the bill that isnt the case so build anything you want to protect your boarders just dont expect other countries to flip the bill
california defends so much the illegal aliens then the federal government should declare all aliens can live in the us as long as they stay in california let them deal with the influx of millions
i dont think that it wont change anything i just think that its not worth the money
a wall is a silly idea ever see terminator a hunterkiller is the answer for every 250 miles of border put one of those in the sky ofcourse they will need ground penetrating radar and bunker busting air to ground weapons economically speaking it would probably be cheaper the tech developed for it would be great for civilian applications aswell and you could drastically reduce the number of these that are used after scary stories about them start circulating im an idiot i will never find a new job now fyi i was denied citizenship under obama and recently became a us citizen under trump true story
i would have love to talk to this men i feel like  a lot of the people who were supporting antiwall fail to bring up major points 1 its a huge waste of taxpayers money because it simply does not work statistically most of illegal immigration came here through visa and overstayed their visa 2 i think it would be much better adding more technology and more agents instead of building a physical barrier which in terms could bring political tension between the two countries in fact many republicans would agree with me in these point of views they have stated their views before also we have to think back and ask ourselves why are they leaving their countrys is it the violence corruption civil wars so then the question is should the usa help these fragile counties which in the long term would reduce migration instead of per say help the middle east which is no where near our country in that would be a better argument then that of building a wall
 1030 seconds so a border
im against a wall because its a waste of money   the cartels have been digging well engineered tunnels under the existing fence since the 1990s  we would be better off with a razor wire fence and a mine field
that guy was a visionary youre an asshole for being so judgmental because of stereotyping for 12 min  fight joe rogan pussy
we need a scientifical xray gate thats more freeflowing
build the wall with your ass bitch hahahahaha keep up the good work steve and jared
425 dont you have to know how to speak properly and be a little smart to have you own show
im sorry i only watch up to 1107 i couldnt finish this
omg just build the wall already what people dont get about the reasons for protecting our borders uggghhhh
a right wing idiot interviewing left wing idiots welcome to america
the problem is there are plenty of illegal folks here that a wall will not stop mexicans are not the only folks coming here and living illegally
this guy has watched to much scifi lol
the guy said hes not mexican lmao
why build a wall when taking over mexico would be better america should just make mexico part of the united states we can help turn mexico into a safer and productive place to be dont block them integrate them the wall is not gonna work anyway
where do you find these fuck tards
the us should create a season pass like six flags for immigrants lol
graffiti that wall
crime analysis has been inverse trajectory crime data is inconsistent but i can tell you this for sure that men are incarcerated at 085  percent most of these incarcerations also include immigration offenses which are handled through civil court
that guy clearly didnt understand the difference between an immigrant and an illegal immigrant you cant tax illegal immigrants if you have no way of knowing where or who they are lol they are effectively invisible people sounds like his solution to illegal immigration was to have people emigrate legally 
i like you crowder  but that stat is full of shit   your smart  run the numbers brotha
the second guy is a complete imbecile
the 2nd guy was hilarious how do we stop undocumented immigrants make them documented lol
that face at the end like wtf did this dude just say to me
x ray scanners
i liked this guy from all his previous videos until i saw this video basic chump supporter
if they say people will get in one way or another then build the wall and force them to try the hardest they ever have enforce the laws we have stabilize our communities and economy
as soon as the mexican dude said who is the real drug dealers did you said ok i got to go  hahhahaha u scared of the truth
so last dude is for the new world order lol
they can come in legally if they wanted to come to america
steven crowder what makes u feel so entitled who the fuck are you its stupid when nobodies think they can be somebody by sticking their noses where they dont belong what do u do for this country that makes u entitled to  it
fact check alex nowrasteh with the libertarian cato institute analyzed the texas data to make a comparison of immigrants in the country illegally and nativeborn residents in a recent post he noted that in 2015 texas police made 815689 arrests of nativeborn americans 37776 arrests of immigrants in the country illegally and 20323 arrests of legal immigrants given the relative populations for each group he wrote the arrest rate for illegal immigrants was 40 percent below that of nativeborn americans
people are just stupid and just coming in illegally is a crime to start withnext time someone rins into your car and screws off is most likely illegal
love louder with crowder rock on awesome change my mind reviews loveem mexican culture sucks x ray machine really kick all them out build the wall real america does not want mexican problems brought into this great country what a huge burden
i have a teacher who says he is pro border security but says the wall is a waste of money because people can dig under or climb over or just drive a truck with explosives through it i argue the explosives are not likely and that the wall will be deep and have security but he still has doubts anything i can say to help him
im sorry but those statistics are wrong
i dont like trump he says we should build a wall and democrats and other people are going crazy thats the problem with todays society they walways want someone to do the research for them there is already a wall in place as of january 2009 us customs and border protection reported that it had more than 580 miles 930 km of barriers in place the total length of the continental border is 1989 miles 3201 kmhttpswwwgooglecomsearchqisthereawallalreadyexistingtoseperatemexicaandtheunitedstatesrlz1caacacenus655us655oqisthereawallalreadyexistingtoseperatemexicaandtheunitedstatesaqschrome69i5722966j0j7sourceidchromeieutf8
this second dude xray scanners and digital passwords
alright so first right out the gate i personally am aganst the wall but not for they reasons you might think first i find it dangerous not to humans but to the wild life many people assume that theres no wildlife near the border and their wrong theres plenty the issue this wall would present is that the wall would block migration routes and also destory the habitat all the pollution from construction and mpre patrols would lead to a bigger enviornmental problem then we already have two lets say the wall doesnt endanger the surrounding wildlife why should mexico pay i mean its not like they pushed for this wall why should they pay imagin if your neigbor decided to build a giant wall between your house and his and he sent you the bill also some background information about me i support more immigration standards im not democratic and no i dont watch and will never watch cnn
he needs some masterminds lol who is this space cadet
mexico is the second largest country in the world that produces ladders
xray boarder that dude has smoked himself dumb
invisible beam border could work well just chip everyone in the right hand or maybe the forehead
how do you tax a person whom you dont know exists this kid is asking basically for legal immigration
she was snitching 
immigrants illegal or otherwise are not committing crimes at a higher rate than citizens httpswwwnytimescominteractive20180330upshotcrimeimmigrationmythhtml
i really hope those interviews were not indicative of the sum level of intelligence in austin that was embarrassing i really like the topic and hope you can find an area of relevance like texas arizona or california but where people have the ability to communicate
people on the right sometimes confuse me how can you support the constitution but at the same time support borders that infringe on our freedom to travel i realize that the wall is to keep illegal immigrants out but we have a lot of border checkpoints in our country right now that go against the constitution
how about dont build a wall because it is a waist of tax payers money that money can be used  for our children schools also having a reasonable path to citizenship we also have citizens that dont pay taxes
leroy is absolutely retarded i think everyone knows what i mean when i say hes cocky when he shouldnt be he didnt say anything cocky he just glows with stupidity cockiness and everyone look at me im specialness at least he was nice
guys his family has been in new mexico since 1550 508
she seems drunkhigh
its the biggest drug smugling route in the world it needs to be extra secured obviously why does nobody regonize this problem
illegal immigration is and has always been an actual problem not just in the usa but every country and not to mention its fucking illegall any single person who tries to debate that is ignorant and most likely racist against their own kind without knowing itdamn entitled hippocrates
build it the majority of illegals are visa overstays anyways
an xray border why didnt we think of that smoke more weed wtf
509 im not mexican im spanish my family has been in new mexico since the 1500s does this man know what he just said im hispanic for anyone thinking im making fun of his reasoning skill in the english language so dont label me as racist more or less label me as just a dick 
my god the guy from new mexico iswow crowder why man my iq just dropped harddddd future new mexico governor right there man him and obviously his mastermind people
xray scanners for the boardershuhand heres a voter
omg that guy is the epitome of stupid
hahaha that spanish guy is an idiot
radioactive wall yeah just zap them like bugs lol
do you have one on religion
building a wall would be nonbeneficial to america the main issue is the fact that the wall would be extremely expensive and making mexico pay for it would be immoral but practical it would not stop the majority of illegal immigrants but it would stop some however in general it would be ineffective and inefficient
hey steven i actually enjoy this change my mind series its interesting how you debate a person from the opposite side of the aisle however i would like to see some sources for all the stats you point out especially the one about immigrants committing 30 of homicides
dude why would you even air this  this was so ridiculous leeroy trejo huh x ray borders  gonna run for office too evidently god help us
omg did this guy just really recommend electronic tracking for the entire populous of the united states and anyone who might want to come in and out of the us wtf
is the second guy high or something he tries too hard to talk like an intelligent person that he ended up making a fool of himself
that guy is really fuckin naive modern day hippy right there 
that look steven gave at the end is my look during this entire video lol xd
that last guy is pretty fucken stupid
xray border   fuck no
it is sad to see all these people on here talk all this trash to each other it is sad to see the world go against each other due to ones racegenderethnicityetcwe are all just stuck in this system we call our government and they are all stuck in the system of survival this world is going to shit and instead of spending the time forgivinghelping and expanding our minds in a positive way  we spend our last bit of air fighting i do agree that people are overcrowding but to hear someone say that the major issue is that these people  mainly mexicans that are overcrowding america is the real issue is disturbing yes sure it is true and sadly these things we so call countrys that are all different to eachother is what is separating humanity apart the real issue is overpopulation  sadly we cant stop that from happening the only way to stop this from getting worse is probably a war so that would be the only real reason any country would declare war on another there are just so many things that are happening and they are all linked to eachother either everyone finds common ground to agree on or we all go down
i actually like the idea of the spanish guy for a tag border and also fast track to easy citizenship i kmow its fucked up but better than nothing just tag them like animals until they obtain legal status
im an austinite born and raised you were talking to homeless people and that last guy was on drugs so i throw out this video as having any merit
trump said we got some bad hombres so ya he did say that and in like the worst way possible
so that guy was for open borders and for people have essentially a barcode read by a scientific ray when they cross sad part is there are millions of people who are this stupid running freely in our country
homeboy is making us new mexicans look bad with his ignorance misinformation of facts  and justification and rationalization lol steven crowder please come to santa fe new mexico we need the support out here allot of young people starting to wake up
so he wants an invasive society lol
i do believe that we should build a wall but do people see we are being distracted yes we should secure our border in time give time lets us clean our own room stop being distracted this is a problem that wont be solved quickly lets clean up our politics firstedit we have been dealing with illegals for a long time the only change is now we are encouraging people to come with things like sanctuary cities and our confused policies stop talking about it just think about it we are tricking people to come get busted what are we doing stop ruining actual peoples lives over some partisan shit
now how much will this thing cost again and how much is the yearly budget of icewhat about tunnels does it stop those
crowder for president
liberals think abortion is ok but cant separate illegal parents from children
950  the us government already do this to us the tourists but without the id tag idea
dont build a wall build a fence omegalul
no building a wall wont stop the problem but they do have a lot of people crossing the border every day and the wall would definitely slow that process down if they didnt find thousands of people crossing the border every year they wouldnt think about the wall right if everybody was just overstaying their visas they would not want to build wall the facts are the facts thousands are crossing the border and thats why the wall was proposed come through the port of entry and claim asylum
im new to your channel steven this is probably the 5th video i watch and it being the 3rd topicprevious two being only two genders and pro gun ive also read through some comments most were about how bad this one was but i gotta ask why not do this video on a campus with educated people i like what youre doing and hope you encounter healthy conversations in every touchy subject out there i just felt little effort was used on this specific topic on your behalf
drug wars
cause she isnt legal
just like technology everything speeds up  just like illegal immigration lmaooooooo
now he wants trumps wall wow dude
i think the non criminals who are already here should be put through the citizenship process and the criminals be deported then start the higher border security to prevent any more from coming illegally
that lady in the start sounds dumb as shit
why not annex mexico and establish police power
xray  govern of new mexico  crack head lmfao the look on steven crowders face  priceless
boy that guy cant speak
its funny how us natives were here first then the white men come and then they killed or kicked them out of america down south to make mexico and then now trump was saying that mexico will pay for it like what the hell hes gonna make them pay for a wall that keeps them out of the land that was theirs first
i dont think the wall should be built because before white people were here us natives didnt have any borders and were allowed to go where ever the white people just moved them down there and named it mexico im native and was born in canada and i have dual citizenship ship with the usa and i feel like mexicans should be same
this guy is profoundly stupid
guns dont kill people people do criminals dont get guns the legal way duh so why waste taxpayer money on a wall when immigrants will just find another way in like overstaying visas tunnels and ladders lol of course they arent gonna all of a sudden just start coming in legally love the hypocrisy by the way im pro gun but the wall is just hype to make scared white people feel safe without actually changing anything
what people dont understand  especially the left and those for open borders   is that if we had open borders  population would spike in dangerous levels   our borders and people coming in have to be regulated  other countries are insanely strict in border control especially mexico   why is the usa the bad guy for wanting to protect its citizens  building the wall is the perfect show of force 
the guys answer to immigration will cost more than the wall lol
the guys answer to immigration will cost more than the wall lol
0405 who the fuck is this guy he has a web show id really like to see it
being a criminal is a life lifestyle choice not a race you can pick your lifestyle you can not pick your race breaking into a country doesnt make you any more a member of that country than breaking into a house makes you a member of the house hold
well listen i support trump in pretty much everything and i agree we need to stop illegal immigration but we cant have a wall but people will always get into the united states or drugs or whatever we need to get a different way that can guarantee no one gets in not a wall blocking land but not underground sea air we definitely shouldnt make mexico pay for all of it or at all im happy for everything else trump does though fuck obama
lol this boy like day gonna have xray scanners lol got me going really good
building the wall would kill thousands of animal that call that land there home as a mexican im pro wall and enter the country legally but what kills me is all the animals that would suffer the consequences of illegal migration change my mind please
wow what a stupid free thought that was
your whole family ought to be executed
everyone in this room is now dumber i reward you no points and may god have mercy on your soul
the wall hurts the ecosystem better the border security
jesus christ  this guy was painful to listen to  why is it that the people who are eager to get on camera are the ones who ramble and have nothing to sayalso do you think youre better than me because your family is from spain
to the second guy look at the uk  we let them all in from europe and pakistan they pay nothing ruin the country dont integrate drain our resources no no no
can someone show me the statistic that illegal immigrants commit 37 of homicides not saying he made it up but i really cant find that data
i like the part about making money off the people that come into the county without bringing more american currency so the country can share its currency to them and then try and make a little bit of it back i mean make more money sounds like perfect logic 
simple solution if you hire illegals your company gets fined 5000 dollars 2nd time 50000 3rd time shit your company down for a year  no jobs no illegals  and then these companies would have to pay a descent wage
im not mexican im spanish my family has been in mexico since the 1500s hahaha what
i kinda feel bad for that second guy because he was so nice and was trying so hard but just had no idea what he was talking about
 uh huh yeah yeah okay sureid have a hard time not zoning out completely trying to listen to people ramble like this
dudes a complete retard
hes here with go green global ready to waste trillions of dollars of energy on a hypothetical wall that wont work 
ladders
stevens facial expression at the end was priceless
build the wall
steven is trying so hard not to laugh  xray scanner guy
people are still to stupid to understand that coming into a country illegaly is a crime its like a homeless man coming into your house and live in it without asking you and when you find out about him living in your house he tells you dude its cold outside so you have to let me live in here
we can build an xray boarder what a fucking idiot lmao 
that guy with the white shirt and backpack does not know how to speak correct english the way he talks is fucking annoying ha ha
a wall wouldnt work also a note took a statistics class and statistics are all bs better yet let just conquer mexico and the rest of south america
i live in new mexico juarez is my neighbor almost 2 hours away drugs and cartel is epidemic here build the fucking wall
we have  wallmart the great wall of china  hadrians wall built the wall by the way am spanish i came tru the front door not the back door
build the wall if you want but i dont think mexico should be paying for it
xray wall how many drugs is that guy on build the wall
i like the look steve gave the camera right after hispanic moron left  
though your face at the end is priceless
im done at xray database gate
that guy is a total moron
so he wants to tag those who are coming through the countrythat doesnt seem sketchy at all 
what the hell is this guy on 
man these people are dumb i am for the wall but i can sit there and explain why we shouldnt have a wall maga
so  instead of walls we suggested to have x ray wall  if so in any case there should be access point to go through and yet to keep that spot there must be a wall  what should have been done is investing into whatever may make people legal citizens like language lessons  adjusting so on   instead of being too lazy or stupid to learn stuff  wait  those kinda peopla already become legal immigrants  and  they dont become legal  only if  they dont want waste their time to   adjust  so its their own fault like cheating on test besides for america instead of investing into a border they should help fix mexicos government  just do marijuana legal man and criminal rate will drop everywhere  jezz loius  how long must we wait for weed to be legal
either way this topic doesnt really matter to me the wall part at least i am personally against illegal immigration but i really like the way you present yourself and your opinions so if you ever get the chance to get to talk to adam from adam ruins everything talk about this at least because it would be awesome to see or hear about
that guyagainst the wall planning to be governori stupid it hurt my head listening to him
that guys got a couple screws lose for real
the idea of a wall is dumb here is an idea and i really hope people get behind this idea why not build a canal that connects the pacific ocean and the gold of mexico both sides could build port cities which sustain their economies and it would substantially decrease illegal immigration nobody is going to swim across a 460 foot deep canal littered with container vessels tuggers and law enforcement please consider this idea thoughtfully let us get the ball rolling on this

we are all illegal immigrants when you think about it anyone who isnt native indian is a fucking illegal immigrant mexicans should ave more rights lilian or not as they also native and closest to native indians
what should we do tax them make them pass a test you mean apply for citizenship that dude was painfully stupid
build the wall and have mexico pay for it
hey mr crowder when your own kind us citizens  stop fucking hiring illegals your wall might work
xray kid hasnt thought any of this through very well
sharks with laser beams im telling u it would workor fill the piranha inbthe rivers dividing usthat would help
put a wall up with a mine field and a moat with sharks and laser beams
fuck people are dumb as fucking shit
stevencrowder  my problem is that we dont need a physical wall more like a high tech surveillance on the border and if theyre going to create a stronger boarder on the southern boarde have that same energy a build a wall on the northern border as well
poor lady the next guy sounds like an ignorant idiot
my brain cells are dying and the last dude wants to be a politician tragic and comical how this is a reality
well if nothing else at least the new mexican guy is creative
dude in the backpack is a complete idiot  its scary to have to share a country with people this stupid
trump 100 said mexicans are bringing in drugsand some he assumes are good peoplecrowder lies often to put his adopted right wing agenda
that nigga is retarded
the more i watch stevens videos the more i notice that it is not really change my mind but change your mindi have noticed that his content would be a little better its already fantastic but i have noticed a pattern if he came off more open minded to other peoples opinionsrather than interrupting them and drumming them with facts and statistics can you please stop interrupting me even though he interrupts them plenty of timesif he genuinely acted as though his mind could be changed rather than shutting them down immediately and interrupting when he has heard enough of their sideagain i think he does a great job but this is just something i have observed since the start of watching the series
ummm whata
make them legal citizens and tax them sorry dude breaking the law to enter this country doesnt result in being handed citizenship they broke the law theyre fucking criminals period
how much weed did that guy smoke before he sat down down just wow liberalism is a mental disorder
dont build the wall secure the border with technology but dont make someone rich building something that will not fix the problem
technically all illegal immigrants are criminals in the united states i mean they break us border laws by illegally coming to our country sooooo yeah
heaven has a gate and only selected people are allowed in hell has open borders that says it all
what did i just listen toleroy seems like hes on something lol
as soon as he said im spanish not mexican my familys been in new mexico since the 1550s i knew he was a moron
the part that surprised me the most was when you called your youtube subs cheap pricks lol
wall unfortunately doesnt work because most illegal immigrants just simply overstay there visa a wall will do nothing because they make ladders or tunnel building which is another main way i just dont see why it would be worth spending billions on a wall when we have a debt like we have and i dont think it would  stop that many illegal immigrants
tbh i shouldnt really care about this issue cause i live in europe but i like discussing stuff it improves my decisionmaking so here goes nothingi agree that a country including the usa ofc should control its borders and i also think that illegal immigrants are more likely to become criminals so you should keep the rate of illegal criminals down however i do not think that building a wall is an efficient solution to the problem it costs too much for too small of a benefit let me explainthe wall would have to be 2000 miles long through rough terrain like mountains rivers and even villages which would result in the most expensive project america has ever had  the cnbc oct 2015 estimated that this would cost between 15 billion and 25 billion dolllarsnow add the cost of staffing and maintaining the wall that every tax payer would have to pay on top of that and we see that such huge investment really needs to fulfill its duty properly to be worth it but controlling immigration is very difficult and is not as intuitive as one might think its estimated that 2740 of all immigrants came in on planes and overstayed their visas so the wall will not stop a significant amount of immigrants at all politifact sept 8 2015even if we talk about the rest 7360 many of these come in legally as well to visit familiy because of business vacation etc and yeah a tourist doesnt pay for healthcare in america he doesnt pay taxes he doesnt pay for things a normal american citizen has to and normally these people go back its like this in every other 1st world country however if you introduce higher border control and it becomes more difficult to cross the border many people just end up staying in the usa because they think its just better for them in the end as they can abuse the system or maybe even just have a higher life standard than before you can think about supervising these people or maybe take measures that dont allow the abuse of the system but this has nothing to do with the wall a wall doesnt stop people who already came in this is what happened during the reagen bush and clinton administration the number of undocumented immigrants rose up by 248 after border controls went up significantly in fact one of 30 illegal immigrants in the usa is an unauthorized immigrant who went over the border undocumented which is less than 4pew research center 2014and even if you still think that a wall would be worth it at this point we still do not know the efficiency of the wall against people who want to cross it illegally how many could sneak by it doesnt matter what kind of wall is built there are easy solutions to overcome a physical wall now regard the fact that its 2000 miles long and you would need to guard it at every point to minimize leaks desperate people will find a way even in berlin before 1989 people got thorugh and that was a much much shorter wall with much higher security measures and very drastic guards shooting every illegal emigrant right awayso all in all we would stop a minuscule amount from coming in but instead even keep potentially over 200 of the normal immigrants in to become illegal at this point i have to say that this idea is just plain unrealistic and wishful thinking i mean building a wall was the solution in the middle ages or even antiquity to protect cities the wall in china that so happens to inspire trump so much wasnt even that effective at that time and were talking about organised attacks by mongols and other people back then who didnt try to sneak in but openly  invaded china the biggest problem the usa has imo is that its system can be easily abused that control and supervision of immigrants is terrible and that you find a job living space and so on in america without documented background or maybe without even people giving a crap about your background  i support everyone who wants to control the border of hisher country but i think we need a better solution than a huge wall  ps i know there is a video where steven tries to debunk adam httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcvdqvs7oe8but i think most points adam made are valid whereas stevens argument debunks some data or some missconceptions but still not the main points adam mentions in his video you still have to see the decision of building a wall for itself and evaluate its worth given the facts that we know and even after what steven said even if true and i believe him thinking all over i still say that a wall is a terrible idea
i just want a wall with freaking laser beamsis that too much to askthrow me a bone 
the spanish guy isnt to bright is he
dont get me wrong i am a fan but everytime that they dont change your mind they lose or so it feels that way but at the same time if you dont change their mind then you lose so its evensteven i love the different ideas but a lot of what i heard from crowder today is not accurate or stereotypically outdated you cant always set parameters on someone when you are asking them to change your mind there was absolutely no success on this topic on changing my mind episode or anyones mind i do have a slight problem with your word usage you used the word border singular not borders and when you did use the word borders the focus was on the mexicanamerican border that is not the only border in america you have the canadianamerican border as well including with alaska and if you really want your agenda fulfilled not reality then you have to build all borders everywhere you have them whether they are land or sea if you want to be genuine with your first proposal that means the alaskanrussian oceansea border and create a ring of a border around hawaii and if it is not a state then let it go just like puerto rico and the virgin islands america has always used gimmicks to gain property and money the socalled louisiana purchase and not stealing land from mexico but getting a valentines gift from mexico with california texas arizona new mexico etc becuase america would never steal or lie about history trust me and if you say with all due respect i can read between the lines well guess what so can i congrats on your success this is not hate at all this is a respectful tribute to the style and format you present in your discussions let go of the virgin islands since they are not a state and including puerto rico if you are serious about building the wall they are not states and if any country similar to russia was in the location of canada you would have lost alaska a long time ago if it is not next to the socalled nation than you will lose it every european country lost theirs including england spain and portugal example losing all the new western developing countries due to selfish conquistadors who were looking to hit the lotto britain lost india and america when the king got greedy with taxes and that is not the end of  the list i believe japan and china were attempted by england by trying to take over hong kong you might say this is long for you and i definitely agree on the lazy eye reader but as much as i still enjoy your videos then you cant complain about the the time you spend reading this because i dont complain about how much time i spend on your videos i truly enjoy them but you do know that north america especially america wants to replicate the currency just like in europe with the euro and they want to call it the amero once a currency bank makes bank other banks will follow where there is war there is crime and america one of the youngest countries about a bit over 200 years old has been in more wars per timeline from inception than any other country since their birth probably more than any other country and the recent wars are not even near the country they are gimmicks to sell weapons and america is the biggest exporter of weapons and america wants to play the blame game and play innocent and point the finger to other smaller countries except for china and russia cus they know they will be in big trouble if they do and when was the last time they won a war honestly the revolution does not count it was not america it was a bunch of colonies still they prolong wars and then lose them on purpose to promote weapon sales the great britain 20 strategy why pick on the small guy if youre so great if you are great then be great on your own as soon as illegal or legal immigrants stop integrating to america then america will become poor and bankrupt and a country smelling blood is going to take the first bite america does not give unless they take more in the long run like taking illegal immigrants and giving them jobs based on greedy employers that are citizens who never get punished they should fine them at the same time you deport illegals shouldnt they the law already exist for the fine to be applied but they never apply it i believe the fine is 10000 per illegalemployee if your socalled wall is a legal defense to defend your socalled country then follow the law and prosecute those breaking the law because those who knowingly hire and even if they wanna play dumb then good cus ignorance of the law is no excuse right building a wall is a demolitionselfdestructingstatus just like the suicidalcard shuffle game america played with the twin towers at everyones expense except the socalled elite its all about profits and image if you wanna stop illegal immigration right just like you say then stop hiring noncitizens including any outsourcing and then keep calling yourself the best when you see your profits and wall street dewindle like a shriveled penis or an old breast from the queen of england no more excitement for you america and no more bragging rights not that they ever existed there is no such thing as legalamericans anyways calling a native american legal is pathetic how can you go to someones home for the first time from another land crossing an entire ocean and call then legal in their own house hell laugh at you but since they are the small guy well i guess just give them reservations and casinos and about 25000 from guilt when they turn 18 and you where never legal anyways all decendants fron europe on stolen land besides legal is an illusion to control your mind and make you a slave if you are human than you are an earthling and thats all that matters borders will be history again and so will multiple languages since both were created to separate people anyways divide and conquer is it not the strategy and game
i am not agaisnt the wall but please once you build the southern wall turn north and continue that wall as well cause a lot of immagrants are coming in through there too cause like mexicans dont need pass port to visit canada
yo this guy living in 2173
id rather the us take over mexico than build a stupid wall ur ignorant if you thank that will do anything go ask illegals how they got here
gosh this was a pain to watch because both people he debated against didnt have good arguments  id demolish this guy in a debate on illegal immigration
proceeds to discreetly speak into a microphone
and then ask him if he wants his paycheck taxes to pay for that
wtf is this second person talking about my head is actually hurting after listening to what he is saying also how the fuck would n xray gate stop ppl from crossing the border lol fml
i believe in securing our borders but i dont think a wall is going to do that maybe this thousand mile x ray id tag border scanner is the way to go
fuck i need a job and i love painting grafitti ill build the wall then go back to broke ass artist
crowder your face said it all after second interviewdiscussion
not immigrants they are illegal aliens
the look on your face at the end is perfect
the guy in the white shirt is a dumbass
come on i thought you wer a smart person with some common sense hey have you heard of planes bbbrah
liberals take all kinds of drugs when they get home so thats why they want open borders so bad
how about bear traps 
canada should build a wall instead
i could feel my iq drop e few points listening to that guy talk about his xray wall
this guy is just babbling mindlessly
omg this one was painful to watch people trying to change your mind  all their talking about is forcing stricter regulations on people that we already know are coming through but that doesnt stop people from coming in illegallyi was at first against the wall but ive thought about it so yes build the thing and get it over with
that leroy guy is smart man whoa
that guy in the white shirt is a moronthat if we let them in we can tax them and whatever and make moneyahhh moron that is what legal immigration is
ok when you leave your house do you lock your doors and windows why why you have a fence around your property when you answer these questions apply it to the reason of why we need a wall if youre against the wall practice what you preach leave your doors open perhaps the homeless people can benefit by taken showers on your bathroom  eating your food or maybe they need your electronics and take it a wall on our borders are need it for the same reasons you have your property behind walls and lock doors
this guy is one of the stupidest interviewers yet and hes got a lot of them you look up retard that guys pictures in the dictionary
whats going on with the first womans bottle shes growing a tree on the go
 bro shut up pendejo your making hispanics look dumb ese
the us could build a wall in there land and  but mexico aint paying shit if the us wants a war then  statistically it would be a repeat of vietnam  and  the whole latin american allies would fight with alongside mexico
stevencrowder love your vids but i just had a question i was hoping you could maybe answer at around 630 of your video you state statistics that 35 of america are undocumented immigrants and they commit 37 of homicides and 13 of violent crimes i wanted to know what source did you pull this data from its because i couldnt find any close numbers on what you said when i was researching or any articles that gave  numbers
we should get an xray machine 
ok so you build the wall and now they cant get in by land but what about the sea the people who would be crossing by land normally would just resort to crossing by boat or coming in by plane and over staying in the long run it wouldnt make a difference the best thing i can think of is using that money to increase patrols and offer large amounts of money as rewords for turning illegals in people are greedy and would so do it offer 2000 per illegal turned in no questions tax free easy money if that dosent work increase the amount offer enough money as a reward and people will be happy to snitch on illegals
just create more jobs to protect the border make it harder for undocumented people to get jobsapartmentscars and so on honestly some people cant afford to leave to come to america maybe having programs in mexico could help stop a lot of illegals meaning helping them with getting green cards and other things like i said more people patrolling the borders more cctvcommand centers and trigger alerts
honestly i dont care who comes here who cares if they are illegals man
i died when he said i one day plan to be the governor of new mexico good luck with that
that was a serious office moment at the end
instead of building a wall id say create more jobs by hiring more border patrol officers
well i disagree on the wall thing not the control the borders the wall  as described  is going to be an expensive thing it is going to make the economic situation worse it will take millions of dollars to build it and thousands for the upkeep
they r so dumb   the wall is 2 stop drug cartels from operating our borders   the wall also pushes people to the legal system
build the xray wall
this episode should have been done at a university these mouth breathers didnt provide much
the wall is gonna be super expensive from high taxes when most mexicans come to america via areoplanes
and we can also like have alien spaceships to watch everyone and make sure they pay taxes you know and then when im governor of new mexico we can like make wil wheaton head of the alien dod and have a phone app run for president you know
i dont think the physical wall is a good idea i think its a waste people who want to come here will find a way i dont know what the right answer is but i dont think the wall will do anything to significantly impact people coming to the us much less stop criminals or drugs from entering
and here i thought extreme feminism was cancer dude at 438
meanwhile in iowa illegals killing actual citizens
thats spanish guy is an ignoramus
in this video  httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwqgw1tkepegthe antichrist irrefutably identified   the beast 666
where can i find the sources crowder cites
swag nice vans
winter is here the brown walkers are coming
build the wall
jesus that dude on about an xray wall was clueless hurt to listen
i dont think the wall would solve anything apart from immigration topic i think spending so much money on a wall seems impractical if theres a will theres a way i believe it cant prevent smuggling illegal immigration etc completely anyway as most people believe i think its a unnecessary tax paying spending and mind you im a govt employee and im the type that doesnt want to waste this countrys money its like prohibition still doesnt stop people passing around booze 
walls dont stop illegal immigration they just create more alternative door ways and cause immigrants in the country to overstay their visas
what the fuck is steven talking shit about he did not say that either  oh yes he didwhen mexico sends their people  their not sending their best their not sending you their not sending you theyre bringing the problems  theyre bringing drugs theyre bringing crime and some of them i assume are good people that is a fatal generalization of a group of peopleso get your fucking shit right steven  i understand you are doing quite a lot of research to propagate republican views and catch otherly thinking in the heat of the moment bombarding them with facts that let the light shine good on your personal perspective  but come on this quote is not to be discussed same as the discussion about the wall itself  it is totally useless a wall will not stop people from effectively coming through and the costs for this project stand in no relation to its use
that guy was hilarious he contradicted himself a lot he did make a few good points but i think he has a lot to learn
i dont feel like the spanish dude represented the cause right ah
i like the getting rid of all borders and replacing them with an xray checkpoint you have to go through only if you have a written note and it there checkpoints all over to track the the immigrants to keep it all free flowing wow
future governor of new mexico on acid
people shouldnt just be able to walk into the country is all im saying i dont want people to come here illegally i want them to come here legally so that they can become americans and have their rights
the wall will pay for itself 1000x over
like a scientifical xray border like yeah like more freeflowing i need to talk to some masterminds and i plan on being like the governor of new mexico like yeahok
second dude makes it sound like its that easy build a wall
im against illegal immigration but i dont like how they are treated by the border patrol  and i dont know if a wall is a good idea
these people are so stupid i couldnt even watch it all
440 this guy is bullshiting from the start he was just there to get views
guy obviously a fan of arnold swarzenegger total recall xray wall  and dont forget to inject people with tracker  readers  
do you really think that a wall will stop illegal mexicans
xray numbers in database and a written notice but he just wants it to be more freeflowing lmao
honestly the most compelling argument against the wall imo is the environmental impacts species that live on both sides of the border will have their range cut off terrestrial migratory animals will not be able to migrate  the construction and physical change to the land will displace many other species and being that people will always figure a way to enter the usa illegally the amount of materials needed in relation to the effectiveness of the wall is not equivalent
i lean towards conservative now with that being said i think the wall is useless because most people that are here illegally come with tourist visas legally and stay here we should focus on fixing that problem first
i have an idea hire private security companies to patrol the border
hey steven did you get your statistics and facts from billy wayne ruddick jr i m just asking because i recognize the same type of logics in your debates with a little more effort maybe one day you will be able to follow in his footsteps
this guy is chatting utter shite  dont build a wall build a giant x ray wall
that second guy was a complete idiotah
where is he getting his data from that 37 of homicides are committed by undocumented immigrants i love these conversations but i would like to have some links to where he gets these statistics from according to snopes npr factcheckorg i cant find a correlation between that data and what steven is talking about anyone got anything from a reputable source
i think it would be cheaper if the usa took over mexico they would probably just roll over and accept the take over no war necessary
americans can do whatever they want within their borders illegal immigrants are traitors to their motherland and invaders to their host country they dont have the right to complain
building the wall will solve a lot of problems with immigration but what they arent talking about is the price of the wall maybe instead of spending all of tax payer money on a wall you could help people in third work countries that need that money to eat or need that money to go to school thats where i would prefer my money to go
ive always found it so odd when people go on about how honest illegal immigrants are when the people they are talking about are committing a crime every secondyou do not just let the burglar off when they have left the house and if they are caught in the house what kind of person keeps going on how honest they aresome one once asked me if twenty years ago some one committed a burglary to feed their family do i think they should have to go to prison now  to which i answered may be not after all twenty years ago they did not get caught but if they are still doing it today and every day for the last twenty years then yes just because they got away with it twenty years ago does not mean they win have the right to get away with it everyday the crime does not end the day they come in every second after that they are still committing a crime being a criminal is a life lifestyle choice not a race you can pick your lifestyle you can not pick your racethe next line they always come up with is how hard working illegal immigrants are to which i say so what some crime is hard work not all crime is easy but its easy than not being a criminal or people would not be criminals do you know whats a harder than being a illegal immigrant being a legal immigrant if it was easier there would be no illegal immigrant legal immigrants are the number one group where a large percentage hate illegal immigrants after all if you had to work hard how would you like people who got the same reward for no workof course they never say illegal immigrants its always some thing like undocumented guest worker which i find odd a guest is some one who is invited and at the end of that invitation leaves a guess has no right to tell me how to live my life and can not get me to change it to be like the place they were so much of a hurry to leave then want me to pay for itbreaking into a country doesnt make you any more a member of that country than breaking into a house makes you a member of the family
i really think he changed your mind steven  what a cretin he was the worst argument ive ever heard from anyone ever
waste of money illegals will probably be the ones to build the wall the fences in place now have ladders built into them for maintenance purposes tunnels are a thing visas idk i like a lot of your videos this one is dumb
if mexicans were white that wall would have been built 50 years ago
yo im from new mexico too
hell nah we need borders
fuck that first lady broke my heart
i live in new mexico and i cannot wait to vote for this x ray governor genius man
i live in new mexico this made me sad
surprised no one simply pointed out that feasibly it doesnt work and its a waste of money as it wont produce any real long term jobs
he plans on being the governor of new mexico lmao
015 to the guy in the dink tshirt the band from akron so cool to see that in austin of all places although im sure politically theyd hate steven crowder or if they were around today theyd write a song trashing him expertly intelligently subtly and with a bumping bass line ohio
if mexican people have to deal with illegal immigration then whats the legal way
crowder do you maintain your canadian residency
do not build a wall stop chain babies and that will end migration oh yeah prosecute workplaces and landlords that knowingly do business  with illegals
this guy wants to be mayor lmfao sad part is he probably will
no more borders in the future oh shoooot this guys been dropping acid it seems
you cant say the word statistically ad state your own generalization
im going to call yousef to whoop your ass on this subject too
around blacks never relax
there will be no wall
can we deport both of them
add gogreenglobal to the list of things to not check out
that dude was geetered out the new governor
700 clean ass r32 only 5000 made in the usa
that look at the literally said it all                wtf
do the people that debate steven crowder even think about what they say before its said this made me want the wall even more
lol its so funny individuals think that they have a right to be in america over other people because you were born there if the roles were reversed and you were born in a country that wasnt as affluent as another you had a family and you could provide a better life for them you wouldnt go ahead and do the same lol of course you would and thats probably the weakest argument for throwing the wall building out of the office absolute retards american privileged retards who wan to act like theyre against immigration like you werent an immigrant at one point in history so stupid when they say out forefathers fought so we can be free like you were on the battlefield lol what have you done for society apart from stink the place up with your uneducated comments and using valuable resources flushing tonnes of mcdonalds down the toilet
but how do you check that without a border wall 
governor of new mexico  cant even talk right ends every sentence with yea
refer to adam ruins everything simple
im glad im not the only one who zoned out the last 4 minutes he speaks so fast and once he started talking about this scifi shit like no borders and x ray tagging i was like this dood is baked
that poor first ladymy biggest concern about a physical wall is the cost of its construction especially if trump pushes that terrible solar panel idea it will do nothing for the tunnels eitherthat said i think we should focus on tightening security in other ways as well as in my opinion if the average american highschool graduate cannot pass the immigration test either the test itself or the quality of public schools needs to be addressed aggressively preferably the latter
what i always say is this what happens when all the mexicans come here and then there is none left in mexico does that mean we can take over that country and populate it maybe we should just make mexico a state of the us and then they dont have to leave mexico
the wall is unbuildable and unachievable theres no way to build it so rly no point in this episode if u want the facts just use the device ur on and google it americas already in debt too so no chance
this is coming from a mexican these guys are fucking idiots
hello i am an open minded mexican american i believe in reenforcing our and people should not be here illegally but i just believe that the wall is not a good idea and will cost lots of money if someone can change my mind or see it from another point off view please answer thanks
that new mexican smh
i love all of these people but when it comes to a wall most immigrants arent coming through on foot most immigrants are actually coming in by plane
i believe what he was talking about was no national borders or walls anywhere and every human on the planet would have an electronic tag  signature so the governmens of the world could track and tax us all accordingly thats got to be one of the most communist thing ive ever heard  what are they teaching our youth in college these days  common sense people
the thing that surprised me the most was that the latin dudes family was living in new mexico since the 1550s
delusions of grandeur is the second guys name
how the fuck all mexicans come from spanish people
a giant wall seems like a giant waste of money especially because the borders terrain people will always find a way in if we make it easier for people to gain citizenship and thus pay taxes and contribute to our country illegal entry would decrease dramatically
i think ive lost more brain cells watching this video out of all the other change my mind videos you have
lets build a giant ditch instead then flush it out every month and lower a bridge to let ppl cross
donald trump u should exray ppl  man bricks are offensive for some reason exray is cool
ya mannnn   no wall exray that thing man lol
the dude in the white shirt is hard to watch hes so stupid
what if the wall is to keep us in i dunno if anyone else notices but this country is off its meds nowand lets face it if something really major did happen the rest of the world would turn on us in two seconds we dont have friends or allies we have people biding their time and smiling to our faces and cursing behind our backs
the wall is a stupid idea tbh i usually agree with crowder but tbh the wall will not be payed for by mexico you cant just do that the us would have to pay and it would cost a lot of money and thats an understatement if illegal immigrants cant climb they will do something else there is proof of tunnels plane routes and sea routes that take you past the border if you are to deal with illegal immigrants youd have to deal with it a different way all a wall would do is cost a shit ton imo
i feel bad for the first woman the poor lady was genuinely scared
trying to interview ordinary people that doesnt support your view is not a way you change your mind if you sincerely want to change your mind just search why doesnt any other country with borders as large or near usa make that stupid wall but if you want to win an argument to prove a point for other conservative ordinary people that is a way to do it
theyre not building no bitch ass wall lmao
trump can you please hurry up and build the northern wall canada is getting too many people running across the border from the us
that second guy is an idiot
if you wanna make them angry do abortions are murder change my mind
build gamma ray laser gun in border who tag them with 3rd grade burns and instant vaporization of organs 
that poor lady obviously most of the people illegally coming into the us are scum law abiding people dont do that kind of thing also people need to be more informed on how to contact ice if you encounter an illegal
why build a wall we are the same people from the same planet by doing a wall we are seperating us and creating hate why dont we love each other man all now has to do with money and shit maybe it will stop the problem but why dont we make weed legal why dont we address the source of the problem instead of creating sonethibg to adress the problem
mexican college guy herejust to put some context mexico doesnt want the wall because of the trumps hate speech also the immigration rate from mexicans to usa is being falling the last years google it if the problem is that the illegal immigrants statistically kill more people than legal we have to understand why they migrate since this is an economic phenomenal one of the ideas that ive heard from some scholars in mexico and usa is cut the illegal selling of weapons from usa to mexico so we can manage the narcotrafic problem we have here now speaking of south america immigrants this topic is aloooooot more complicated because of the extreme poverty and ungovernability of those countries yeah worst than mexico one of the ideas of the next mexican administration is to reinforce the economic activity in those countries so they wont have the necessity of migrate view from a basic and pragmatic perspective the wall sounds good but once you see the topic from a public policy  economic perspective is not that good and you guys americans will pay for it from your taxes and is alot of mone money you can use in other issues
what this guy was talking about this xray thing and that it scans you sounds a lot like mark of the beast screw that love god and make jesus your lord and savior
that guy was so hard to listen to it was like listening to a child with a brain injury
that look at the end was perfect
my grandma came here a non citizen and became a citizen other illegals should too dont do it illegally because its illegal simple
this man finna get shot eventually 
he was not born in the great usa
jesus the second interview i literally lost brain cells he has no idea what hes talking about nor how boarders work hes an idiot
america already has a border you are asking the questions in a very partial manner you keep asking so you dont agree that there should be security along the borders everyone disagrees with building a wall because they are probably scared shitless that they will have to pay more tax for the next who knows how many years because us fucked up government has to pay off the wall and also because it probably wont make a darn difference because all them ceos and bosses need their coke and heroin also spend billions of dollars to build a wall and billions fighting fake so called wars across the globe to protect americans yet thousands and thousands of american citizens are homeless
right now there are a lot of holes in the great wall of china and a lot of bricks have been sold from people who stole them the next problem is the money in order to prevent the stealing of bricks you would need to make the wall out of iron and that would be too expensive and economically not possible next problem is that the wall ends in the sea and the immigrants can literally go around it however there is a way to patroll that but again it costs money and people the next problem are farmers whose land the wall will go through
next timedont waste my time my phone battery or the space on that chair with an interview of that caliber i would have rather heard comentary on an empty chair rather than than that dumb ass and his mastermind ideas  governor to be his candidacy woud be the true test of a nation success or demise as an american of mexican heritage this dumb ass was an embarrassment on ideas and vocabulary build the fn wall and spike his body on a steak as a warning to everyone that having some sort of education is critical before opening your mouth
i feel like the wall is just wasteful were already in a deficit are we going to fund it with more debt and if you can enforce immigration law in a humane way of course whats the need for the wall at any rate a wall may not guarantee keeping people out
so the dude basically wants scanners every where that the government can use to find you at any timescary
my mind is changed we should go for the xray wall
crowder has the patience of job
trump did say that stuff about mexicans
the spanish guy had no idea lol xray scanner but no border
if you think about it all illegal immigrants are criminals illegal immigration is against the law therefore its a criminal act am i wrong here
an xray boarder 
in all seriousness building a wall to solve any problem is the worst idea ever in human history no wall ever in human history has ever solved a problem at least in terms of keeping humans out of anything also immigration is homo sapien sapiens worst made up fearit probably has something to do with fear of taking resources you cant taste touch hear see or smell an imaginary so called border in historical terms nothing has ever stopped anyone traveling anywhere yetin earth context please steven crowder please change my mind about the immigration fallacy
a wall will not solve the problem of immigration i do propose a different solution annexing the entire world
i wish i could be on this show and make a real argument against building a wall unlike these dumb asses
why are people even yelling at him like i litterally dont understand why would you want someone to illegally sneak into your country
that dude was living in 3034 like fuck im confused
i mean im a fan of trump but the walls dumb its way to expensive there was a video that showed how much it would cost to build the wall and it was something like 50b and then just as much to maintain it per year
how about a moat with florida alligators  or a mine field
that spanish guys a fucking mouthbreather
i am no liberal i am no conservative pro life i am pro gun i am this wall i am not for what it is is not wrong but its intentions isnt to keep people out its to keep us in promote your own self imprisonment because of a false reason of a narrative tell people to question all news because it is good but dont take your own advice like you should
i like the spanish  guyrating all the mexicans outbring in drugs and smuggling humanslol
a lot of the same folks arguing more gun control wont stop criminals from getting guns also argue that a wall will stop illegal immigration but thats none of my business
hopes and dreams and lets not offend people and hope for the best for the us lmao 
i wish i was there for this argument with steven theres three reasons the wall hasnt been built yet one the uneven terrain at the southern border its not all flat dry land two private land some of the wall will go into private property and many resorts dont want to see a concrete wall blocking natural views 3 surveillance drones we have spent 28 billion on various border security measures the drones and helicopters and thousands of border patrol guards another way to protect the border is to follow the way mexico handles foreign invaders into its country if you or i trespassed into mexico for the first time we would be sent to jail for 2 years if we did it again we would be placed in prison for 10 years
new mexico guy is suggesting orwellian level shit he should be forced to read 1984
that last guy was a twit
x ray border homie
leroy just basically said everyone should get microchipped illuminati confirmed
i want to ask any of you something well lets say american government finishes the wall because i hope you know theres already a wall but its unfinished so now you have that wall well next problem the us are the biggest consumer of illegal drugs in the world you guys have a really huge problem with drugs thousands die every year because of overdose so who provides all your consumers with heroin meth etc yeah the cartels haha and guess what american  arms industry profits a loooooooot from selling weapons to the cartels ah and also the cartels bribe many of your officers and politicians so how much do you think drugs and arms business is worth so let me tell you something the wall is just a demagogic speech who of you really think your problems with your southern neighbours are going to end with the wall are you really so naiv hope not because your politicians and business men love money and drugs and weapons are very profitable or may i remind you what happen with the hsbc case a couple years ago do you even remember or know something about that hsbc is still operating in the us a bank that launders cartels moneyso well i understand you want to end the problem but well how do i put it your problems are much more complex than that you know the wall is at best a palliative measure besides think about this its highly convenient for your country to have a strong mexican neighbour why because if mexicans feel safe and happy in their country they wont seek to flee to the us to find a better life so you see your problems are much more complex than you think you should adress right now two of them the astonishing amount of drug addicts and the greediness of your businessman and politicians oh another recommendation pay attention with what trump does specially when it comes to trading matters hes doing it the wrong way remember in these new times of geopolitics there is only two options either the us china and russia rule the world or therell be trouble serious trouble be critical
can this guy even hear himself talking everyone should be documented but good luck finding them
i swear people are only against the wall because of the way the left wing media has demonized it
these guys are a lot more open minded then the sjws in the gender vid
build the mind change my wall
i can literally see mexico from my backyard i live in san diego there is a wall a big one and like two old ones as well lol do people in middle america not realize how big of a wall we have
european descendants is what im going to call themsurely not americans at all are all just upset because the hispanics arent giving up as easy or being taken over with cowardice acts such as the ones toward the real natives of this land there are very few actual americans in this country compared to the immigrant population which is actually the majority of this country
thank you for educating my people its really embarrassing how ignorant they are 
build the wall but not with my tax money
im a hispanic man but more then that im a patriot build the damn wall already i live in texas and we need it desperately now please hurry mr president my city san antonio is a absolute shit hole now if you dont like it get out of my country that my both grandpas fought for and my uncle twice in nam cut the shit and build the wall asap
might be the dumbest fucker youve ever talked to steven
at 422  areas where we disagree compared to areas where we disagree smooth steven 
governor of new mexico good luck with that
stevencrowder how about the fact that the wall will impact wildlife in a very detrimental way im against a physical wall but im for securing the border were in the age of uavs thats much better than destroying or hindering the migration of our animals
i dont see much benefit from building a wall the cost of building a wall and then enforcing patrols the power required to run spotlights etc would be  a waste of us tax payers hard earned money regardless of this the length of the border is large enough in itself therefore it will obviously take time to build something that could quite simply be suspended by a new party when they come into office therefore wasting the tax payers money again i also dont see how a wall prevents people from digging it wouldnt surprise me if drug trafficking continued through underground networks and into the country obviously it is not much help pointing out the problems without a valid solutioni propose building a line of motion sensors a few feet underground and guard posts spaced at reasonable distances apart from one another a simple fence with barbed wire along the border with the sensors underneath would significantly reduce the cost and time to build maintain and monitor the wall if someone were to cut the fence it would be cheap to fix if someone then climbs through or underneath the motion sensors would go off alerting the guard posts to the locationi seriously think this is a more logical and economical approach to reducing illegal immigration into the us
people dont like the wall but those people are stupid because illegals are coming into america taking jobs and committing crimes why do people like this its keeping this country clean and better why do people dont like the wall  please reply tell me good reasons why the wall is bad
this dude is missing his tin foil hat lol xray border lol
that second guy calling himself spanish no just no
oh my dear lord this guy is absolutely clueless  build that wall now
leroy needs to lay off the illegal drugs
dude i dont know how you sit down and have serious conversations with some of these people wants to be the governor of new mexico
build the f wall
yall here about the teenage girl killed by a mentally ill illegal
why blur the face but not the name badge
i was compelled to hit like as soon as i realized we were looking at the next governor of new mexico
x ray border 2020 hehehheheh
leroys idea was great and super progressive  it just lacked the solution for enforcement if you built a physical wall you would have to ramp up boarder guards in order for it to function otherwise people gonna find ways around it or corrupt the few guards that are there leroys idea also needs extra enforcement in form of new ways of reading citizen ids by cops we will all have to get tagged which is a bleak sounding future because then we basically wear our social media accounts on our sleves but its the only feasible option ive been hearing yet if we dont just start punishing companies that employ illegal workers as soon as an illegal immigrant  who didnt use the scanner gate or xray boarder and thus does not possess an id or timelimited token will be treated like a visitor and if they dont have a visa they land in jail not longterm prison because that would just prolong the problem not fix it and get deported if they dont have the funds to leave the country again themselves sounds very logical and easier to implement than an army of boarder guards that needs to be payed enough if you underpay boarder guards you will get corruption and then illegal immigrants will have extra freedom because everybody thinks theyre safe from them now if you implement scanner gates you still have the chance of hackers helping illegal immigrants to get in of course but those will be way fewer than with corrupt boarder guards edit after thinking a bit about it a digital id will also cause legal citizens to go through the same procedure regularly to update their id or token for it to stay authenticated so there might be then a roughly same amount of costs and effort as an army of boarder guards
why does this guy and an a to the end of every word
i think adam makes some very good points httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv0wk6rswxqro
building a wall is for small brain people  i mean if you gotta build a wall for immigrants then might as well build a fucking doom around the united states  lol because immigrants arent just mexicans  there are immigrants from all around the world so this is really stupid bruh  lol and you are a canadian so they should build a wall between us and canada lmao  a physical wall is just retarded
you wont talk about sven computer   change my mind
what are the stats about crime being higher by illegals because i cant find that anywhere on google and i be quoting crowder to everyone i need to back it up
how you gonna tax an undocumented immigrant
x ray border so an energy wall do you believe in a wall no so much fail
i would like to say that i am all for border control but a wall is not going to help at all and would overall be damaging to the economy and would not help decrease the number of illegal immigrants that enter the united states also it would raise taxes and it would probably increase the poverty rate
xray wall sign me up go space force 
stevencrowder id like to try to change youre about the border i think ill have a  better understanding or insight on building a wall since ive worked on the border before
sharing this with you because i do find you to really want to have factual information  which is great to see in modern society  however i would suggest that you do check some of the facts you are sharing especially in this video  2 things you promote as pieces of your defense that are factually incorrect1heres a study done in texas httpswwwcatoorgpublicationsimmigrationresearchpolicybriefcriminalimmigrantstexasillegalimmigrantacross the board illegal immigrants caused less crimes than native persons  on some of the statistics much lessheres another study by oxfords ccj httpcriminologyoxfordrecomview101093acrefore97801902640790010001acrefore9780190264079e93in general you need to think about the motivation of a person that is in this country illegally  the last thing they want to do is draw attention to themselves as they know that will resort in deportation2httpstwittercomrealdonaldtrumpstatus630906211790102528langenhttpstwittercomrealdonaldtrumpstatus1009071403918864385langenhttpstwittercomrealdonaldtrumpstatus1008696508697513985refsrctwsrc5etfw7ctwcamp5etweetembed7ctwterm5e1008696508697513985refurlhttps3a2f2fwwwvoxcom2fpolicyandpolitics2f20182f62f182f174746002ftrumptweetcrimegermanysooo many times trump has said that illegal immigrants cause crime
mexicans are the only real legal people in the west all of you are the real illegalsbut build your wall if it makes you feel safer from the cartels or whatever and shut the fuck up
lmao that guy is so illiterate
undebatable fact the americas two continents which include north and south america comprised of canada usa mexico colombia have been inhabited and migrated by indigenous peoples like the mexican people youre trying to keep out for over 10000 years you fing inbreed idiots so where do you want us to go you have stolen native land destroyed it to build malls factories and industrial size farms and now you want to build a fucking wall the nerve of some of you have you even considered the problems a wall would create for the wildlife that travel across the border of course notyoure too busy shooting anything that moves for sport you monsters why dont you go back to the hell you came from because let me remind you that europeans euro is a big clue here are not native to the american continent
the first guy literally explained what the wall would help do and then said that he doesnt want the wall
mexican friend said build the wall why you my ask he said usamerica can starve itself to death its not his problem d
the wall is bull man i live in mission tx where this issue goes on in my back yard literaly and the only thing that might solve illegal imigration is to stop corruption with the border patrol agents we literally have high ranking agents making deals with the master crosser the person that is in charge of getting a group of people across the border so they have a safe passege so yea you can build a wall but money talks
hahahaahahaha that guy is not spanish  spanish my ass
where does the illegal immigrants being 35 percent of the population but commit 37 percent of homicides figure come from
i like that mexican guys idea lets just give all people in this world a tag and let the cattle roam free we could do eartags or like a chip really close to our spine so when we remove it we will dieeasy right   we needah a tagah iah  already  prophesizedah  believe in meeeeah  hahahhaha
this dude is on dope
the spanish dude was high as fuck 
build the fucking wall you wont stop us you bitches
i would need to have a few mastermind individuals
saying change my mind after stating your premise is ultimately a fallacy you must give reason before asking someone else to change your view also it isnt necessarily a fair debate considering you have the ability to prepare your arguments prior your not at all open to your mind being changed because you are so stuck in your own ways
wow the second guy from new mexico is another one of those dingbat dipshits who knows not the garbage coming out of his mouth  hey homes lets get superman to fix the border or lets cast a spell and magically fix it all with no consequences for anyone because its the white mans problem not us new mexicans he probably is a  new mexican
i really liked the end of the vid when the lib chickens starting squalking i thought steve throw wome feed on the ground and run
i dont believe in the wall because statistics show that illegal immigration is at a 15 year low and the ones who do illegally immigrate either come from overseas or overstay their visas a wall wont do anything and we have more important things to focus on
i think that we should build a wall but a mental wall we can instill fear into them we can always offer temporary work visas that we can charge and tax them so we can make money of them and if they want to stay we have to run a background check on them every year and see if they are actually working if approved then they can renew their work visa so itll be more like a membership that keeps them here  and if they end up not paying then we can send them back itll be very easy to locate because well have an updated portfolio on almost every aspect of what they are doing here such as addresses jobs and clubs that they have joined also we can implement a bunch of different laws for them that are just a little more strict than citizen laws after 15 of paying and doing everything right and causing no problems then they are granted free residency then after 20 they are granted citizenship
why dont we build a wall because a that would be a waste of money funding a project would take alot of money out of the taxpayers pocket b it wouldnt actually stop illegal immigration because most people just overstay their visa c the legal immigration process is actually horrific there are judges that take on thousands of cases a day and the process can take many years d people escape for safety reasons e if youre worried about an immigrant taking your job then you probably have more important things to worry about dont build the wall change my mind
building a wall would have many repercussions that many conservatives whove never even been to the border dont understand border towns rely on mexicans coming over the border and shopping at local businesses 90 of the income of downtown el paso is from people coming over the border every time mexico or its people are antagonized by the president on twitter the peso devalues and the people are discouraged to shops in these border towns a border wall with one of our closest trade partner would have the same effect building a wall is infeasible and would have more negative effects than positive
i think i had the same look as stephen at the end are you kidding me
i want this wall to be built already  i want to see if its really going to stop all these murders lol
traps are gay change my mind
everyone with an electronic id so that the government can track you and control commercehmmmmyou mean like the mark of the beastrevelation 1318
the second guy lives in 3018 while we live in 2018
build the wall and let me work medical for it lol
1 mexico is not paying for the wall2 it will cost tax payers a minimum of 216 billion3 mexican immigrants will build mile long tunnels under the wall similar to how they broke el chapo out of prison all those times so in other words an unsightly wall will coast tax dollars billions of dollars and illegal immigrants will still be able to get into the countrybonus a lot of small companies such as pizza shops bakeries and restaurants will be crippled and forced to go out of business there are a lot of mom and pop stores who rely on cheap labor from immigrants mean while larger businesses rely on prison labor so in order for the consumer demand to be met big companies will have to take the place of these businesses and we would need more prisoners to do those jobs
some of the people that sit down make me cringe
const mymind  falsechange my mind
he just argued for building an invisible wall
i plan to be the governor of new mexico no chance bro you cant even speak properly scientifical lol what a loser
if you are concerned for this womans wellbeing dont just blur her face blur her id badge too
you know the other sides arguement is quality when they drive by yelling fuck you
its an xray border
i dont support that nazi wall 99 come here for a better life usa has the right to accept anyone that wants a better life the majority immigrants are hard working and non violent
it surprised me to hear the claim that 37 of murders were committed by illegal immigrants i was unable to find this statistic after a bit of googling could anyone provide me with the citation for this thanks
if all the risks that illegal immigrants face while getting to the border dont prevent them from going there i truly dont think a wall will stop them like they rather die than stay were they are cause theyre likely to die there toobut at least try to get a better life
tunnels boats rope ladders airplanes environmental barrier for migrating wildlife blimps choppers graffiti destruction cost racial statementno canadian wall
i mean i totally disagree we should build a wall and i seriously dislike trump but i have to say those trump protesters were really dumb
who came up with these statistics
has his mind ever been change if so tell me the video please
this dude is just an anarchist he doesnt know how to explain a world without government the problem with a utopia is there is no need for power the ones in power wont relinquish that relic now that true peace is easily obtained no average citizen of any country would wish for war unless in retaliation as long as we let the figure heads fight for power we will never unite as one
put the wall up and make mexico pay for it fuck it this is the us i served my country
how do laws exist if borders dont how does taxation work
berlin wallyour welcome
make a racism wall
there is no way your family has been in the us since the 1550s without interbreeding with other ethnicities he is definetely not spanish
he said his family was in new mexico since like the 1550s america was founded in the 1700scracked me up
wall is useless since most immigrants come into the country with tourist visa and via plane but just never returns to the country they came from
dafuq was that guy on
nice walther t
hey why dont you do white privilege you do the easiest arguments when you prepare a lot of thesis but you cant do white privilege lmfao nice
my big concerns is if you can get in without any one noticing you can kidnap someone and   take them out pluss as long as there are  countrys that want to destroy america why would you leave the door wide open
scientifical
you talking to a bunch of potatoes is not the best content you shouldve held on to this one man
build a wall jesus christ
i dont doubt that the us has issues with illegal immigrants and something needs to be done to combat this but the obstacle i see blatantly staring this topic in the face would be the financial cost of building said wall and the security of it not sure how much it would cost to build it and if an estimate has been given please let me know but would it not make more sense to just tighten up the security and add more guards and staff along the border with more patrol cars and stations alone the boarder to me it does because a wall cant point or shoot a gun thoughts
that spanish guy is just a apologist haha what about the guys selling the drugs
i worked with many mexicans and illegals for the last 10 years they never pay taxes they always seem to find a way to dodge taxes but are quick to get government assistance but this is just my experience
we shouldnt have a border wall we should have a xray scanner border every city should have spy cameras  everyone should have an electronic id and everyone regardless of nationality should pay taxes to america but a border wall is a ridiculous ideai died laughing when he said he wanted to become governor of new mexico
are there any episodes in the change my mind series that get a decent conversation going
dide in the white shirt lmfaoooooo just wow he is just regurgitating bullshit from fake news
that lady was so sweet
anyone who lives in the us pays taxes they need to buy things like toilet paper buy gas for their cars rent a place to live all those things produce taxes if you are working class you never end up paying income tax anyway the only thing we lose on is social security so why not get a better system for work permits we need more people in the us to support the social security system most immigrants come here to work lets help them do it legally
that guy whos talking about taxing them is a fuckin retard where was he from again new mexico maybe they should build the wall with new mexico on the mexico side like hes ever even paid taxes come on bro get the fuck outta here puto
though the wall is a pretty extreme suggestion it is important to make sure that immigrants come in legally and not to go through the borders
build an x ray gate through where they can come inhow do you fix a gate without a wall
instead of building a walls make it easier to come into the country legally instead of making it so lengthy and costly make it easier people have jobs and people to take care off and it takes years and years to finish it time and money is a huge deal and if theyre is multiple people in the family imagine how long it will take for them all to get in and then still start over in a new country where they know and have nothing
im spanish im from new mexico lol
im all for stopping illegal immigration but the whole wall thing is very stupida its super expensiveb grow up mexico is not going to pay for itc people can bypass walls with advanced tech like stairs ropes and tunnels andd most illegal immigrants arrive by plain
by the time the wall is done mexicans will have invented teleportation
i dont like crowder but leroy here has no idea wtf he is talking about this guy is a moron he is disabled i think
xray wall genius
the second guy is a complete joke
htf do you have a  on illegals when ou have no clue how many ppl are illegal lol
really 100 of illegal immigrants commit crimes because it was a crime to come to america illegally
great video as always i would have asked that guy um no wall huh  well do you lock your doors at night before you go to bed and why 
holy shit that guy in the white shirt filming his show  cringe to the max
mexican alex jones
is this just words would you ever change your mind on your outdated and erroneous information i bet a mouths wages you wouldnt change your mind but deny any information that contradicts your information im so amazed at conservatives that think they are being noble were having a conversation here no you are just trying to shut the other guy up just like you accuse the other side doing to you
i think that the first woman meant freetravel between countries like in the eu
your stats are not correct you use your stats which are slanted towards your view from the fbi says your stats are bogus building a fucking wall reminds me of the eastern block nations the wall was meant to keep the people in i say lets deport all canadians back to their fucking nation including your ass
protect those borders is rightwing for i have no clue how borders work btdt
the only way to stop them with a wall is if we build it around canada and both oceans and mexico
dont want a wall great i expect these illegals to move into your house  why have a lock on your door why not just let anyone into your house
dude does have a point  let everyone already here become citezens so you can tax them but then strict the immigration laws throughout
illegal immigrants dont pay taxes because they cannot get a legal job without being a legal citizen
thous millions trillions of dollarsthousands to trillions
you should do a part 2 for this i dont think we should build a wall  but i know you can convince me otherwise i actually want to be convinced so that i can understand
the wall is a bad idea not because illegals should come here its because there are better ways to prevent this that wont cost billions of dollar imagine passing a law that will make mandatory jail time for highering someone who cant provide legal documents that would be free that would remove the desire to come to america we dont want to do that because we benefit from their cheap labor
liberals just want to combine  mexico and the united states
omgthis people is what america has becomeand he wants to be the governor of new mexico note to self never move to new mexico
why not just increase surveillance at the border you dont need a wall that can be jumped over if you just put sensors and stuff am i completely wrong here
giant free flowing xray border gates with id scanners people really are willing to go to any lengths to disagree with trump
there are a bunch of tunnels too maybe flood these tunnels with sewer
a xray border its called a fucking wall lol
i actually didnt have much of a stance on this matter before watching the video
tell mexico get your sheet together or we will steam roll you and build a smaller wall at panama
x ray way  virtual check points  and digital tags  what is guy trying to say it makes no sense
fuck this shit its a flat out scam its called change my mind and all he does is stating his opinion he has never granted a single word against his opinion and you can literally measure the time both parts speak in every video and he always uses more time than the other part yet he always whines saying youre not letting me speak
these videos just make me want some damn good clam chowder
im not mexican  im a pos
come legally or dont come at allbetter yet just dont come  you arent wanted stay in your own country
please provide a source for the claim that the undocumented population commit 37 percent of murders  that doesnt seem remotely credible
ladies and gentlemen the future governor of mexico right there lololol just build the wall and keep america safe
running for governor  this guys ideas are syfy thoughts of an 8 year old
in the future were going to travel faster lol lol that guy with the bookbag cracks me up
build a wall with your ass 
they second guy is an idiot
dont know if hes joking why build the wall thats a lot of money to build and maintain it and we dont exactly have a lot of money to spend people wanna build this yet there is lots of college debt and no free healthcare id rather have free education or hc than a stupid wall
check jose for his green card  or whatever his name is  he makes my head and ears hurt
dont need to waste usa money  people would volunteer to guard usa border  just give people the right to shoot illegal immigrants on united state soilif mexicans know people will shoot at them on usa soil  they would think twice before running in the dark  its like when you see signs saying camera is in use  people think twice before stealing because they see cameras
all mexicans eat garbage and corona is piss waterchange my mind
we will have to import half of mexico to get enough illegals to build a damn wall and bring it in under budget sooooo 3 strands of barb wire followed by a hundred yards of landmines should do the trick
xray man seems pretty confused
youre doing the lords work some of these people hurt my brain
this mexican calling himself a spaniard 
the guy insists hes spanish not mexican that his family has been in new mexico since the 1550s around there  bullshit everything about that just screams bullshit im sorry this guy is not a us citizen there is absolutely no way i have to wonder why crowder didnt call him out on that and he wants to be the governor of new mexico but says new mexico is a sanctuary city hes not only a liar hes a delusional idiot with no grasp of the english language to boot
see im slightly neutral on this but mainly out of the fact that i dont really care about it too much i believe immigrants should adapt to the countrys culture and values and contribute a wall may keep some illegal immigrants out but it may not be cost effective and yes a little silly however it would work and it would make a lot of jobs for a while too i guess i just dont think a wall is the best answer when their already existing immigration policies need to either be a more strict or b more in line with what americans would actually value for bringing in citizens because yes it is a burden to make room for more people and they have to pull their weight im a very frustrated canadian with justin trudeaus basically open boarders and i can empathize with people who are also frustrated with the us immigration situation
i believe leroy had some good points but a physical wall should be built in my personal opinion an xray wall would pollute every near by city or town with gamma radiation and i the price to build an xray wall would be astronomical
this guy is talking about marking people wtf o0you keep that bionic shit to yourself lmao
235 whats a mexican american immigrant   lolyou lose
the scary part is that the wall may be used to keep us from fleeing into mexico when they try to take our gunsthink about it
if the government is trying to disarm us then a wall isnt a good thing its actually a very bad sign that big brother is infringing our rights and also trying to put up a wall just like berlin 1961
crowder you should cover the bible ban thats happening in california
crowder you should cover the bible ban thats happening in california
it was hilarious hearing that last guy just talk himself downwards into that insane x ray plan wtf
950  all immigrants coming into the us need to be checked and put into the system and they should pay taxes how do you do this without any kind of border control i dont knowhaha wow
to become a citizen they have to pay no less than 800 dollars make them a citizen hahahahahaha okay
that guy is such an ignorant moron
httpswwwpolitifactcomfloridastatements2017aug30mattgaetzgaetzmisleadsclaimaboutimmigrantscrimehttpwwwfoxnewscomopinion20170712illegalimmigrantcrimewaveevidenceishardtofindhtmlhttpswwwnytimescominteractive20180330upshotcrimeimmigrationmythhtmlsteven you were blowing smoke up that young mans behind 1st trump did say that majority of illegal immigrants from mexico were criminals and that should be our primary reasoning for building the way 2 theres no way to record an accurate number for crime statistics for illegal immigrants 3 theres no evidence that illegal immigrants have committed 36 of murders even according to the fbi website btw im an independent so i like to research facts not biased partisan bull you should try it and get your feelings about your supposed socialist upbringing off your shoulders really consider the financial burden building a 20 billion wall would be on our economy especially with our national debt being so high also consider that most illegal immigrants over stay their visas so how does building a wall fix that not to mention that trump basically lied to the country by overpromising and saying mexico would build the wall when its clear they wont
we will have to border up the whole country then north and south side of the country immigrants are coming from canada which we are now supposedly realizing same as americans there are mexicans individuals pay their taxes every year knowing they will not get a tax return also dont leave off that there are americans would dont pay taxes and are back up there are children who were brought illegally and are doing everything to do right their parents wrong by applying for their citizenship but the process and government deny themthere are borders already in place why are arguing as if there are not forces already in place i dont think we should spend our money building it higher when we will fly north to your home canada and come down illegally we will find a way if we are willing to find any option to live in a great country and suffer the journey and dangers why will america not be more open and support the administration that does the countless paperwork interviews and filing countless applications the process is expensive and lawyers exploited people by hiking up prices just to submit a form there are other options other than the wall  please let your mind be changed and review the back bone of the system
i am so embarrassed hearing how ignorant and uneducated our latin american culture is the ideas and thoughts ive heard are so irrelevant and nonsensical really makes me sad
jesus christ universities certainly have succeeded in churning out lockstep mindless simpletons glad i earned by bachelors and jd through independent study
i dont oppose the wall the issue i have is the lack of solution or more effective ways to accommodate those who actually seeks asylum or have established themselves already as hardworking members of society i also have issue with the bigotry and grouping of people into stereotypes just because we can the only time i would ever support building the wall is if theres a proper plan moving forward and i dont think this administration is capable of planning the future its been all about wanting results now without regards to the ramifications of tomorrow
shame on texasmass graves with remains of migrants uncovered in texasdespite a dramatic rise in the number of unaccompanied children trying to cross the rio grande river into texas the overall number of us border patrol apprehensions  one indicator of the flow of illegal immigration  is vastly down compared with the figures from a decade agobut the number of migrants found dead on ranches north of the texas border appears to have risen in recent years last year 87 bodies were discovered and 129 in 2012 many are still unidentifiedthe guardian
bruh i wish i have spoken to you about this topic or any topic we disagree ma man i would enjoy a heated conversation with him
i dont get why people want to go to the us tbhbut hey its that very false american dream which to me is a total fallacyagain i repeat build your wall with your money 
united states needs to make a go fund me page to pay for the wall
the guy from new mexico has no idea what hes talking about lmao
lets put a dome on top of us dont let illegals fly in either
xray border putting chips in people that guy is crazy as hell
bro that dude was trippin
how do you know where hes gonna do this public events i want to discuss this topic civilized with someone
here is a video stating all the reasons why a wall wont do anythinghttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv0wk6rswxqro
id like to go on my own island and have several cities all that strive around big subjects for example a science city stuff like mathconstructionatsronomyphysicsetc cities with subsections of schoolsdistricts of the big subjects would be such a cool place each city trading knowledge with each other a statesmall country of intelligent helpful people
in 510 years we will have teleportation change my mind
why you shouldnt build a wall because it wont stop anything statically more illegals enter through boats and airplanes then crossing the border on foot it will literally solve nothing and it would just be a reason to raise taxes costing millions to maintain for years after the initial start of it being built second point is theres actually allready walls built in alot of places with problems of illegals guess what they do they climb over or under it anyways the problem that needs to be solved is our immgration services more american citzens get deported then actual illegalsresearch it third point the main reason we have so many illegals that stay here and abuse the systems if because they cant freely go back and forth because its to hard to get here if it werent for that they would go home when there done working
wtf did i just listen to just wtf lets have spectre gunships flying over the border with infrared
ok that guy is clearly on coke
all a wall would do is create massive mexican ladder business
love it  we need to tax them or better yet set up hamster wheels or conveyor belts so as they come in they will generate electricity or something  for those who are going to be kicked back out maybe we can get them to build the wall  joking aside i know its serious for some and a dangerous life they are trying to leave
i dont knowi dont knowi dont knowjust make it somehowi dont knowsigh
i wonder who those few master mind individuals would be that he was talking about because i certainly wouldnt want him sitting at that table lol
that mexican guy is a fucking moron lol
at 1039 my boy not rely how science works
wtf 
the last 3 seconds were amazing 
this interview made me laugh and cry at the same time
electronic tags for immigrants im sure he thinks hes a liberal and not a fascist
never mind the wall we need a moat filled with sharks with fricking laser beams on their heads
is she retarded
that spanish dude is one brain dead pile of shit and as for governor  if that is the future of our country we are in deep shit  what a fuck up
is the wall economically feasible and will it work
the problem with this whole thing is that people that are pro  building the wall think that trumps main aim here is to decrease the amount of illegals crossing the border into the states its not he just wants to leave behind a big wall with his name on it which is fine i suppose he wants to leave behind a legacy like his dad but realistically its more of an ego thing than anything else and he will do it using other peoples money the american tax payerits all he knows unfortunately a lot of his supporters have bought into the idea without actually thinking about it rationally the roi on this wall will be distinctly mediocre it will stop a few but nowhere near solve the problem
just wondering has anyone ever changed your mind and why
pineapple dont go on pizza change my mind
hahaha you got 2 drunk people to discuss with you man this one is a lame argument
i like how are you promotes the idea of having chips in people per se which is what a lot of people are saying to fight against and then he never did get to the point of if there is no border how can you make them walk through a checkpoint
that guys a frikken idiot
xray wall 
what in the fuck is the second guy talking about 
1030 hahah holy shit was this man stupid
i cant travel anywhere illegaly  why should other people of any color
sorry i cant watch this this guy is all over the place
i would like to be a participant in this discussion as a sit down guest can i please have some information as to how to register thanks in advance
building a wall to keep out illegal immigrants to a country built and made by illegal immigrants is hypocritical america is stolen land texas and many other states use to be mexico
its sad how this man just really misrepresented the views of those against the wall its a unique view for sure but not really thought out at all its obvious hes someone who think hes gonna do big things with a half thought out plan i really hope he does this topic again and gets an intelligent conversation with maybe an illegal immigrant turned citizen because i think a lot of people overlook a large part of the story such as what led people to make a really very dangerous deadly journey across the border also the difficult of getting into the country legally i think ultimately if we want to end the magnitude at which immigration is at we have to improve the situation these people deal with in their home country because if you take away the motive i think that illegal immigration would really see a drop as for the crime immigrants commit i think thats where we really need to focus our efforts in i feel like instead of stopping immigration full force weeding out the bad ones would be more beneficial and effective though i dont know exactly what that would look likealso just realized im probably not against some type of border just not that full blown concrete walls because americas rich but not that rich
uneducated misinformed emotionally charged that is political description of most people who argue on the left and the right stop using facebook for your news stop buying into the 2 sided bullshit stop being so lazy and go do some research misinformation and the apathy to do research is 90 of this countries issue
do you personally believe in all these statements youre making
i am actually against the wall and id love to just sit down and chat about this topic
illegal immigration is a problem yes but to build a wall is a bit a reach i am all for more military and people to keep people who shouldnt be here meaning drug dealers gun dealers and drug trafficking its perfectly fine to make a newer better way of tracking who is coming into the country
these people that are strongly against the wall have come to a very emotionally attached perspective that they have come to fabricate from being exposed to horror stories of racist people in power them thinking that it affects them the deportation police 
that dude is on drugs
build the wall if youd like i find it incredibly pointless considering a lot of immigrants just come and overstay their visas anyway also north and south korea have the most secure border in the world and wellpeople still get through my problem isnt building the wall its finding reasoning in it why waste so much money on a project with very little impact on what you are trying to accomplish it seems more like a visual representation of what we are trying to do more or so for the people and not for the cause or problem they are fighting to resolve
man says hes  spanish yet this nigga got a mexicanhispanic  accent 
that jim look from the office at the end
i do not support illegal immigrants but dont u think building the wall would cost usa alot i mean we arent talking about millions or billions but maybe upto hundred billions for a full length physical border frm coast to coast a better or more economical solution can be researched n implemented also talking about drugs why only the suppliers are blamed for it why instead of blaming the source we correct ourselves n the ban from people taking it
the wall is to keep american tax slaves in as well as of 2018 if you owe more than 51000 to the extortionist called the irs you cant get a us passport
what about the mass shootings europeans are the real minority english comes from latin
the guy from new mexico said he would need a couple of masterminds to solve the problem what the hell man masterminds is this nintendo
my argument against of building a wall it separates 2 nations and ruins the relationship with that country your going to have these young mexican children see and hear about this wall and grow up to hate your country
0049 this is why liberals embarrass me
build a huge wall made of glass so we can see their faces when they arrive to hop over the fence
you call youself mexican but your family has been in newmexico from the 1550 i dont understand
the reason why people migrate is because they are scared to fight for a better life in their country so would rather live in another country that suit their needs which is fine with me but you cant let an entire population invade another country and expect peace
build an xray wallthe governor of new mexico
people are not coming to usa walking since 2005 or 2006 because of the cartels and violence in the north of mexico build a wall wont help mexican illegals have between 3 and 6 kids sometimes more because they love the irs credits while americans prefers dogs and cats thats the reason you believe mexicans still crossing the border its happening inside there are more mexicans in california next in 2021 texas and growing stop irs credits instead of that stupid wall
mexico isnt sending their best they are sending rapist murderers and drugs blah blah blahtrump didnt say the majority of them are criminalslol
what surprised me the most was your staged bullshit in the beginning actually it didnt lol
i want to argue but i cant bc of my age but i want to share my opinion aswell which is im against the wall the main reason for that its bc from what i know and what ive seen is that most immigrants are people who want a better opportunity for their family specially their kids there is also dreamers ppl who arnt citizens but work hard at school and want to have a successful life but what trump is doing is closing their doors hes limiting their apportunities and thats where all the anger and disagreement comes from and since he still making laws why not make a fair one such as if you are an immigrant but you have not commited a crime u can become a citizen now it doesnt necessarily have to be becoming a citizen but atleast something that will open doors for them something that gives them opportunities anyways those were my thoughts those were my opinions thanks if u agree or read it
people are a resource  negan twd
honestly as a son of an immigrant whos got his legal status as a resident in the us i feel like a wall isnt our first priority but would be a slight improvement the system needs to improve so it can be fair for both sides a secure border and making citizenship easier to be acquired
racist assholes
does he ever put out any link to any of the research he claims to be true while putting out a statistical evidence
why does he always picks topics trumps advocates for
leroy is down with the chip
there are already xrays  at the border k9 sniffing dogs  they already have people asking why you are coming into the country  there are already card readers rfid in your passport or global entry  cards there are secondary revision practices there are cbp checkpoints after you enter the usalicense plate readers are active  youre entire profile of you are is pulled up when you crossthere already exists a method of paying taxes  its called obtaining an itin a number used by the irs that is given to people who do not qualify for social security numbersim tired of all this damn ignorance the government also gives out visas to come into the united states   the problem is there is a culture of defiance and disrespect for the government  in the countries south of the border they really dont care to understand how laws are applied and what they mean 
i like you and your opinions but this is one that i dont agree with
i was binge watching these change my mind episodes all day today after a few my bullshit detector went off this is obviously a guy whos really skilled at debate trying to push a republican agenda the story is just too republican to be true im from canada and i came to america for a better life get the fuck out of here with that garbage canada has its problems but no canadian is going to claim america is better also just about everyone he interviews is a complete and total moron he doesnt show debates against people who have half a brain and im sure some have sat down with him to make it even more stupid when people agree with them he uses his debate skills to make them look great this is a not so subtle ploy to get idiots to vote red ive been a republican leaning moderate my whole life and im watching the republican party pander to idiots more and more this kind of crap is what im talking about
damn his face at the end xd
i feel so bad for steven in these because people are so unintelligible and have close to zero argumentative skills their logic is usually pretty f u c k e d
grabbin popcorn for this one
i disagree with questionable statistics steven used in this video and i think theyre irrelevant  anyways  i think we should stop trying to come up with explanations as to why to build the wall and just put it in place on both ends of the states using the same reasoning as all countries in the world  to mark the territory and to control who goes in and out at their current state the mexican border is laughable and the canadian is practically nonexistent
dude wants a big brother the government knows where they are at all times 
latin dudes coked tf out xd
most  illegal immigrants come by plane mexico is laughing bro
hungary build a wall because of illegal immigrants i am not racist or the people that live in this country i have black people in my family and friends from other racespeople judged us and still do but i am okay with itwe build that wall because we wanted to protect our countryif you wants to come to my country legally there is no problem with it because we know who are you and that you not harmfulbut if you come here   with out your papers and we dont know who are you that could be harmful and if you dont have your papers then register your self to get citizenship is very hard and lot money i get ityou wants to live in peace and have a job that pays well all we ask that do it legallyi am praying every night for those people who lost their home or lives in bad conditionsand please excuse my english knowledge i am still learning
the biggest problem that i see with a border wall is what happens when trump leaves the office the billions or trillions of dollars that will be spent on this wall could easily be ripped down by the next president thus further putting the usa further into debt
today i learned that liberal bastards dont have fences around their yards and no doors on their homes  you can actually go in and use their swimming pool their casa es su casa
most people that are illegal immigrants are those got here by plane and they overstayed their visas i dont think the wall is going to do anything productive
the guy in the white shirt is retarded
i wonder if the native americans built a wall during their time how would this land be
protect the boarders is really important and makes sense but with an actual physical wall why there are other strategies for sure i agree that illegal immigrants must be deported but also agree that the legally ones help with the country growth and development
the last guy is sadly misinformed yah sure put ms13 on the honor system and theyll consent to some fictitious tagging system also they will enter the country through designated entry points at the former border that is past its relevance in the new age this form of reasoning is what scares me about leftists not only are they a danger to themselves their ideas are a danger to the rest of the united states citizens
that guy didnt look like spanish spanish are white but he looked mexican
i may have a different perspective on this issue as i was once heavily anti illegal immigrants until i fell in love with a mexican woman legal but some of her family member are not now i do understand the deportation of criminal illegals thats simple dont come here illegally and do illegal things or you get the boot but for those that are actively working and contributing to the countries gdp i think they should be given an outlet to where obtaining a citizenship could be easier in college i had a my foreign policy professor hand out standard united states citizenship test booklets and though many of the questions in there are easy for any truly patriotic person i definitely believe there are questions within that booklet that most americans would struggle with i say do a survey large enough to determine what the average american knows and get those questions off of the test im aware there are other factors regarding getting a citizenship but i think making the test more realistic is a step in the right direction
this guy is the biggest walking contradiction i have ever seen
the face of what the fuck just happened when he left 
that spanish guy is fucking retarded 
i dont agree with the 37 statistic please cite
i agree lets secure both borders north and south merica crowder youre canadian why should you weigh in on what is best for us americans
building a wall is a horrible idea and a waste of money there are plenty of other solutions that work better and cost less
a country that was founded by unwelcome immigrants now wants very strict immigration laws lol  walls were built in the past china springs to mind it was quite great apparently lol   reagan famously once said and i quote tear down this wall and trump wants one built lmfao   the irony is almost hilarioussome nations are ruled by dictators the us is just ruled by a dick lol
being illegal means their job prospects are slim between starvation and crime most people will choose crime
get that second guy a scholarship to harvard a man clearly way ahead of his time
family has been in new mexico since 1550s wtf 504
ten feet higher
she says 3 words then says im talking to much like shes dropping knowledge hahahahabahahaha
that mexican is a real dumbass
hes not wrong 
i doubt that a wall gonna stop no onebut idk
get this smart xray guy deported
cause youre waisting your money on something that wont stop us 
next one is water wet change my mind
2 just wow thats gotta be ethically way worse then a wall
i agree they should build a wall sky high but history shows theyll just tunnel under
wow snitch
that guy was all about his own posting on youtube
tag them like cattle is that what this nut thinks will work  wow
surprising how ignorant some of these people are
that guy with the camera thought he was gonna school stevenbut it was painful to watch that trainwreck but like but like
restricts vision of border patroltoo much money ladders and ropesppl will find away around itsteven made a horrible mistakeif most want to stay under the radar then they arent committing crimes
how stupid are these people  its like a home how would you secure it and defend it if you dont control who you want to get in 
liberals the grossest stupidest people on earth
here is a plan build that wall deport the illegals with actually feloniesnot the part of being a illegal immigrant give a type of citizenship that says that if you commit a crime you will get deported make these immigrants with that type of citizenship go through the process of becoming an actual citizen i would also heavily guard the border look yall might not want to know this if you are against the wall but you know mexico has a heavily guarded border with the other countries they are hypocrites so dont give me that crap about being morally right because they do the same fucking thing that almost every smart country should do have a fucking border security anything would help like damn even obama said you had to something about the illegals originally so did hillary give me your thoughts and other ideas to fix this mess
they want a better life they want what americans have they want free money healthcare and the ability to vote heres the problem  we owe illegals nothing they have no right to demand anything  it should be easier to become a citizen agreed but a borderless country a sanctuary city no  only positive change will occur by voting republican  every city and or state run by democrats are shit look at california  chicago new york i live in chicago and its shit because of the sanctuary city bullshit  our mayor protects illegals and muslims above all others its a joke
pretty scary that dude thinks the solution is rfid yea lets just create the minority report real quick
they have the right to do it but like it would cost so much and would just be a bit of a waste
he says to use a xray gate a gate is something you build between some sort of a wall so when he said that he basically said build the wall with a xray gate there
that dude is a mexicanchange my mind
what was that guy smoking
i never realized people were this stupid
we know the wall isnt going to happend but border control should get reinforced
they should just say its expensive  thats the only argument i can think of right now  though its not actually even that expensive so it still doesnt work
im against the wall it messes with animal migration we need to send militias to beat the shit out of illegal immigrants breaking the law
where is this  i would love to sit down and try to change your mind not sarcastic just want to challenge the subject i live in santa rosa california i would love if you came to the santa rosa junior college campus
where is the murder stat from
trump says numerously and very clearly that mexicans are drug lords and rapists very racist
tf steven stop u dont want your mind changed ive watched to much of these u want to argue
xray borderyea  that will work if he is the future governor of new mexico god save us all
build the wall
no matter what is your opinion about illegal immigration the wall does not work on the contrary it hampers access for mexicans looking for work while criminals come to the country without much more difficulty
this last guy should have just kept walking past the tent
marvel is better than dc change my mind
what would it cost to build this wall what does it cost the us to house illegal immigrants would it make more sense to pay more money into border security rather than a wall could we lower drug crime and trafficing naturally by ending war on drugs im not sure if a wall is great solution personally walls are a thing of the past that dont seem to work well you gonna have to pay more for people to protect the wall and maintenance more of a symbol of divide than anything but if you ask most people there should be something done
im mexican and i agree with the wall
so he wants everyone to have trackers
illigal immigrants do pay taxes
the wall can be 100ft tall and illegals will still cross the through that wall howtheyre crawl under the wall just like they have been for the last 30 years stupid gringos
the people interviewed had the mind of 12 year oldssad
what really concerns me is what if we at war on american soil or martial law and nobody can leave as fast cus theres walls on the boarders it can keep people in jus as much keep people out
build the wall and let mexico keep the money they would have spent in the us so that the economy in mexico improves over time
hi love your show but you need to put away the 3 us population illegal immigrants  30 us homicides statistic  its wrong like basic arithmetic wrong as some basic googling can confirm and makes your other stats and figures highly suspect  your figure is based on a report the original author has since tried to correct but now its been repeated so much its assumed to be fact  most importantly the percentage was based on the sum of all homicides between 2005  2008 but was divided by only the homicides from 2008 naturally this inflates the statistic tremendouslymore info  httpswwwcenterforsecuritypolicyorg20151204problemswithgaoillegalaliencrimestats
the people who drive by and scream dont even read the sign smh
boy has never been at the border
i say no wall specifically because it looks bad when a country has walls just increase security more checkpoints multiple checkpoints overhead watch ill gladly sign up you give me 10 an hour and ill ride the border all night and day
im not mexican im spanish hahaha spanish people dont look like you buddy sorry but you look central american
uhhhh wow  i dont want to be mean because thats not the spirit of these dialogues  but jesus titty fucking christ  that was hard to watch  he definitely has a mind for being involved in government  and thats not meant to be a compliment  nah sure xray borders  could totally work  not that well need them in 510 years when the world has 0 borders  looking forward to it  israel and palestine get your shit together quick
we dont have bordersbetween maine florida washington and california huge no place is like this but we have to border the states to enforce our own lack of borders
love the shirt
xray scanner lmfao sounds like a space border lol
literally had the same expression on my face at the end of the video
that guy realizes that an xray wall would cause literal cancer and would be more expensive to build maintain right
that second guy sounds like hes describing idiocracy
leroy kind of won that one lets build that xray
tagging people with electronic id sounds far worse and orwellian than a fucking wall
whats the point in building a wall when the people watching the border are taking bribesyou want to stop illegal immigration help make mexico become a more ideal place to live kids with good homes dont run away citizens of countries with thriving economies dont illegally cross borders
the wall will likely make any immigration problem worse illegal or otherwise to my knowledge the mexican immigrants come over to the us to provide for their families if and lets be real here when they find a way to get around the wall they likely will still attempt to provide for their families but the wall would completely discourage any attempt to get back to mexico
im not paying for a fucking wall
build the wall sorry come through the right way or dont come
the spanish dude cant be serious   xray gate that reads your id when you come in
sooo tag people like you do with cattle got it
xray scanner wall hahahaha why didnt you idiots vote this guy president it would be fucking hilarioushello mexico its the president of the united states here we are going to need you to go halfsies on an xray scanner wallsorry what
hilariousim spanish not mexican my family moved there in the 1550s hey just so you knowthat makes you spanish unless you were born in the usalol
i will build the wall with the corpses of you fucking mexicans
i know illegal immigrants who are good people who came so their children can have a better life but some are bad so i dont know how to feel
the spanish dude is he on meth
the shit an ex ray border what the actual hell nice guy but my god
lol the wall aint gonna do shit more people will just find a way over it or around it aka through air transport and oversea travel
that first lady made absolutely no sense scary  edited nor does the second guy clicking off the video i cant stand it
bait building the wall but the topic is about immigration the physical wall is stupid wtf
i couldnt watch the spanish dudeomg
that made me laugh so much omg
550   please what crowder trump didnt said mexicans are bringing drugs crime etchttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjaz1j0scl4please comment on this one
one of the reason why these drug cartels coming here illegally cause of the broken borders and we build that wall the tunnels are going to be next
that guy was on some next level drugs lmao
lmao i like that kid x ray scan border kid was high as shit
how about this fuck mexico the mexican government is the problem those corrupt bastardspressure them to get their shit together invade mexico and take care of the people that need cared for save the people next door easier to drive to the warthe mexican people should be on board with that
i can promise this guy is not spanish its not our racial identity at all
whya does thisa guya talka lika that
this guy doesnt want a wall but he wants everyone chipped like a lost dog
lol a xray boarder  build that dam wall if we have open boarders you might as well say bye bye to our country
i think that the fix to immigration is to make it easy to legally immigrate the country and get a hefty ass tax rate that allows u to make enough to live but not super high quality and once a set percent of their money has been paid in the tax will lower and so on and so forth until they become american citizens this way any money lost on the immigrating is at least one way or another brought back in the reason i say this is there are more than enough jobs every construction company ive worked for always needs more hardworking laborers because the white guys virtually never make it because a lot of times ive seen them be very lazy as far as solving crime goes if you fuck up you get screwed were not taking u back to mexico if u break the law as an immigrant then u get dropped a mile off of the coast of somalia and work it the fuck out that outta stop people from fucking around same law would apply from people who jump the border even with an easily accessible way in and if you dont have a job within a month youre gone and u dont get any government assistance this is just my opinion because ive seen how most illegal immigrants act in the states and theyre more good than harm
how do you know those statistics of ilegal immigrants if people dont know about those illegal immigrants cause if the government notices they will be deported
imuh willinguh to betuh this guyuh is stoneduh
this spanish person is simple jack
if these people who support illegal immigration were in power they would have less wage more competition for jobs and a more degraded life in general i want to move to the usa but i dont fit the criteria for a work visa or citizenship though i could pass a citizenship test which isnt all that hard funnily enough i failed the british citizenship test that is if the tests the immigration websites lead you to are valid
im not sure how many people know this but most illegals file tax returns and receive refunds however the tax they pay into the social security system they will most assuredly never collect because they change their ssns so often
this hispanic guy is an idiot  he wants chip all of us
every forest has its capacity same goes with countries
that made my head hurt
guysyou might get this nice open minded lady hurt by the gangsters that she said are in her buildingjust saying 0340
ill provide you with the percentage of the population each group is and the percentage of total murders they commit that is based on this link httpsenwikipediaorgwikiraceandcrimeintheunitedstatesblacks 13 of the population52 of murders whites 68 of the population 45 of murdershispanics 15 of the population128 of murders hispanics as a whole are not a hyper violent segment of our population look at the murder rates in border cities with ultra high hispanic populations they are lower than average el paso is right on the border and 80 spanish speaking and has one of the lowest murder rates in the country look it up facts not slander
i dont agree with some of steves stats i do not think that illegals commit 37 of the murders that does not add up according to recent uniform crime statistics hispanics account for 128 of all murders so if all hispanics account for 13 of all murders how do illegals who are only 13 of the hispanic population commit 3x more murders than all hispanics i agree with steven 85 of the time but im sick of these bogus statistics which frankly are a slander to a group of people please do not respond to my post until you read the link httpsenwikipediaorgwikiraceandcrimeintheunitedstates
stopping illegal immigration is a good thing the only problems i have with building a wall is 1 whos paying for this and how much will it cost to maintain such a wall2 the implications of a wall infringing upon peoples property3 how effective will this wall even be
o god that guy with the book bag makes us all dumber just listening to him
the wall isnt really going to solve the bigger problem the vast majority of illegal immigrants get in the country by planes and overstay their visas and a the vast majority of them arent even from mexico anymore they used to be back in 2009 but not anymore they are from both asia and central america
oh my  is  leroy the young spanish man getting his education from a cracker jack box  really  tax them  put a chip on them he just might win as govenor of new mexico  hes got the politician jibe down  no facts necessary  opinions reign supreme  creepy
this fool is talking about hes not mexican hes spanish hahahahasome of them say that shit knowing damn well theyre straight sombrero circle dancers lolol they do that shit in front of white people to make themselves seem more like them smfh i know puerto ricans who say the same shit
dont get me wrong an xray wall would be pretty fucking cool but that guy is a real basketcase
black people shouldnt have an opinion about any of this
ok heres when stevens wrong  immigrants may cost the us billions but imagine how much they make for the us hes acting like they dont pay there taxes at all imagine all the times they get taxed and if they want them to stop costing the us money just make it a law to not ask for a job on the sheet with out getting professionally hired then there wont be problems and my parents are immigrants and my dad pays so much fucking taxes he owns restaurants and to see all the money go away cuz of taxes is fucking disappointing and im glad its costing the us money because we dont even know where are fuck tax money is going to  so why would any civilian fucking care
lol the second guy was high as a kite and it seemed like he didnt know what he was talking about and didnt know any of the facts with the facts being the facts we need to get the crime down and the drugs down
its too bad that most people started talking about the immigration aspect i am against the wall simply because it isnt worth the tax dollars
i do believe in secure borders but the wall im talking specifically about the wall donald trump has proposed ie the height and materials he proposed is just unpractical financial wise you could pay thousand of people to patrol the border with that money that would be money much better spent
a xray wall  wtf
this dude is naive
why doesnt anyone mention mexican immigration laws theyve got much stricter laws on this than we doand they also have a barrier on their southern border as well
dude wants thx 1138 society
sounds like the spanish guy wants the mark of the beast lol
love these discussions  and understand the value and reason of leaving them unedited that said  why give a guy like this white tshirt dude air time ive had more intelligent conversations with my 12 year old regarding these issues
nigga honestly i dont give a fuck about the wall  like they cant come here illegally and if they do come here illegally they are gonna get caught anyways so whats the point in even coming here illegally they need to come here legally the only thing i dont believe in is that mexico should pay for it we should pay for it
a wall would work with decreasing illegal immigration but it wouldnt work for stopping criminals bringing in drugs theyll just find more ways to go around the wall thus making the purpose of the wall pointless costing billions of tax payer dollarsimmigration especially on our southern is a mess as the legal process to become a citizen takes to damn long months to years even for the refugee asylum seekers it can take a few months you have to think why do people come here illegally its because our system is so slow and so bureaucratic that these people cant wait to come here legally for fear of their lives in their own country many of these people live in terrible conditions that most americans cant fathom where the fear of being killed by drug cartels is real if you were in their shoes what would you do if you had a family that was constantly stuck in the crossfire of warring gangs and thugs would you risk youre life and the lives of your kids by waiting months to years trying to legally come to america or would you take the risk of coming here illegally the option most go with is the second because theres a less likely chance of them dying trying to come here illegallyim all for legal immigration but the process must be more streamlined and simpler then what it is these people want to come to our country and most are hard working family oriented and christian they want to be apart of this awesome country that guarantees them rights that many other countries do not which is the same reason my ancestors and many other peoples ancestors came her over 100 years agoyou may say that theres violent and crazy individuals who want to immigrate here to that i say those people are in the vast minority and you cannot punish those who wish to genuinely come here and make their lives better due to the actions of a few just like you cant punish law abiding firearm owners by restricting their gun rights due to the actions of a few crazy individuals you may also say that they will take advantage of welfare and government assistance the same goes for this as well for you cant punish the hard working immigrant for the actions of the lazy onewould this completely get rid of illegal immigration probably not but a quicker and easier path to legally come to the us might lower the amount of illegal immigrants
the look on crowders face as the guy leaves is priceless
i havent watched the video yet so ill edit once im done but if he doesnt change his mind by the end of this video then he is talking to wrong people theres a trillions reasons why we shouldnt build a wall and i this point i think steve is just out to get people to watch more videos which isnt bad at all but well see after i watched update soonupdate after watching great conversation between the two it seemed leroy was a little confused but he had the right mindset he made great points and i believe steve should have followed up with stronger points but he didnt the first woman kind of scared me lol she gave me a feeling of hate probably mainly due to her experiences with people in her community so ill be looking forward to an educated person discuss this topic with you steven because this is a simple change my mind idk why even have this topic its a step back from your others change my mind videos it just screams ignorance and in no way shape or form am i calling you ignorant hope this helps i am at work writing this from my phone so excuse the grammar  
build the wall then build sniper towers we arent playing anymore
id send that dumb fucking kid back jesus hes 1 of the dumbest people ive ever herd he wants to be mayor of new mexico aswell lol god help um
what a dumb fucking kid
that mexican women is fucking crazy
leroy why dont you have a nice hot cup of shut the fup
hey leroy you dont see it slowing down too soon right only a f idiot would vote for you and santa fe new mexico get out of here
i thought build the wall was just a metaphor for increasing border security and thats a good thing right when people come here illegally not only does it put american citizens in potential danger but its unfair to the people who have been waiting for years to get in legally
has there ever been an episode where steven had his mind changed or someone he talked to had hisher mind changed
we cant tax illegals  great idea dufus
that look at the end lol
understand this as long as drugs are wanted in the united states cartels will come in through any wall thats built they are the most powerful organized crime in the world theres documentaries on them saying the same exact thing people pay the cartel to come through and they know damn well how to get things through as around 80 of illegal narcotics in the us come from mexicoa wall will be a waste of tax dollars money and a laughingstock mexico government will never pay for it because theyre involved with the cartels themselves gladly not all members and the money could be used to help out the poverty issue mexico has instead which turns out to be the reason people leave the country this isnt the middle ages improve border patrol security with proper planning protection and procedures for all because the issue isnt just immigration it is the factors behind that action that need understanding firsti came legally into this country about 11 years ago and all i hope for is for nationalism to never be an influence into decisions instead acknowledged the cultural divisions within the borders this country and out
also why do people propose the argument theyre gonna make mexico pay for it those people probably imagine a bunch of us soldiers running up to the president of mexico with guns saying give us 20 billion dollars to build the wall like its through tariffs or trade taxes
i see some people talking about stevens stats and how they are inaccurate even if they are at it is 20 not 4050 the fact that these people are here illegally makes any number high they commit crimes and if they do get caught that is more tax payers money that goes toward housing them in jails and everything else that goes along with it
oh my god watching that guy was painful
if the laws already in place were followed through we wouldnt need to build a wall  if you are in the usa illegally and you are caught you get booted out  if you are paying illegals under the table you are fined jailed and they are booted  i understand that families are disrupted but that is a risk when you are breaking the law
one question who is paying for the wall mexicans aint paying it does that mean its going to be taken from our taxes
honestly if they build the wall we gona be good at another thingpolevoltin
whoever deported my uncle your moms a hoe
imagine if you argued with professionals who were too smart to be on your show
the key talking points never came up 1 what country would actually end up paying for it 2 would it actually resolve illegal immigration into the us from mexico 3 would it be maintainable and serve its purpose for the foreseeable future
this dudes living in 3018
second dude is a gay cholo
does he actually believe these things or is it just for the video
borders in general are going to become a thing of the past and then he proposes having some sort of scanner to get ilegal immigrants passport and personal information nothing in there makes any sense    lefties really do live in their own fantasy world  unbelievable
this dude doesnt know his ass from his elbow
lol when the wall comes it will be build by illegals your argument is invalid no matter what happens things wont change usa has a history of fucking countries over for resources lol and then wonder why are the same people are coming over from the countries that had been cough invaded cough
i love the second person this is a free thought to execute this i will need to find mastermind individuals i can dig it lol
ludicrous a wall   maybe its because im english amd we dont do stuff like that anymore but it sounds mental get a grip people
xray border what a fing moron
stevencrowder where do you get your statistics i wanna be smart like you 
so this guy wants every one chipped aka mark of the beast this is our future peoplethe time is nearmake your choice
look at history the wall is a great idea somecountries these illegals would have been shot
money border card electronic codeing only cash card with debt and fraud protection and your traditional cards it would stop alot of crime as well were almost there anyway
this guy is such a moron causation and corrolation  only people who can afford food get obese so to fight obesity we need to give away all our money  poverty breeds crime some obviously the most poor people will have the highest crime statistics illegal immigrants arent generally very rich so obviously they will be disproportionately represented in crime statistics
one thing i love about history is that it speaks volume to truth and it separates hypocrisy here is my reason why america is a country of hypocrisy a banner of deception and lies until this day it is a a emperialism to its core the united states manifested a world wide control based on fear democracy spreading while pillaging weaker powers globally 1776 it became an independent nation making it 241 years old you call yourself america forgetting it is a continent european americans you systematically deprived people of their land dannie is canadian  a common wealth of the british empire  he has the privilege to have been born in canada now living in the us i suppose you are lucky you werent born in a country that isnt festering with crime hunger and a systematically corrupt government that sells out to the wants of richer neighbors countries that were bled dry by your forefathers applying your foot on the weak and applying pressure to the neck now you want to build a wall you colonized and immigrated with no repercussion there were no mighty armies to kick you out when you stole land you went to war  and stole resource by the sword who the fuck held you people responsible there was no mighty un you dont want them when they arrive legally nor when they arrive illegally  for 284 years prior to 1776 when the us was just colonies your ancestors came by the thousands thundering into land already owned no statistics then of the hundreds killed because europeans wanted nothing to do with monarchies after centuries you people got tired of fighting each other got tired of getting taxed up the ass   you sailed into the new world was their a barricade holding you back customs maybe homeland security or ice on boats in the middle of the atlantic  the mexicans did not build a wall when america went into their land and settled  into california new mexico texas nevada arizona so save me the hypocrisy the us is a land of immigrants the land notably belongs to tribes of native america not you five dollar indians that paid for the mantle which is all colonizers of  british or mainland european descent talking about im american your ancestry goes back 525 years have you not noticed that besides canada and the us the further south including the carribean islands you go geographaly the more brown and dark people you fucking encounter the carribean islands are lands that after thousands of years separated from north and south america white americans will never change the only immigrants in the americas are the 521 years of your existence on the continent if your going to spill your filthy rhetoric of building a wall to keep out mexicans understand that genetically and geographaly their ancestors in the americas go further than fucking 521 years you colonized africa now you want to keep africans out of europe hypocrisy you made institutional racism in all land on continents you colonized from guam to the philippines hawaii to puerto rico you have shamed them for their differences hypocrisy you enslaved blacks speaking of all men are created equal built a nation around democracy and free will while demonizing the existence of a people you supposedly gave them freedom only to benefit from it with institutionalized prison and racism to hypocrisy you are not so different from your  ancestors you have not changed if god exist he will deal your cards once you leave this earth you have committed atrocities against your neighbor you and your ancestors have brought pain and anguish to millions world wide until this day you still pillage for wealth in the middle east not democracy braided in lies its easy to forgive past actions but when you constantly demonize those seeking a better life you are the nail that must be removed 521 years causing destruction 241 as a nation built on hypocrisy and lies but lets make america the continent great again which entails 525 years ago i have no hate for you colonizers its not in my nature to hate humans i do hate your hypocritical nature i do despise the lies you tell yourselves the hate you spill you have your neo counterparts screaming go back to africa to unsuspecting americans of african descent go back to your land i would have hoped native americans yelled go back to europe your hypocrisy has no depth no volume it cannot surpass you shame south africans for what they do now when you did it to the multitude from the americas to asia to make it even worse you even terrorize your own i reiterate i do not hate you colonizers i despise your hypocrisy your hate your lies most of all its the  disparaging aura of the world surrounding your own it would be a big mistake for the world to think america is a pro people moving forward america is a failed state america and its greatness is hindered by its hypocrisy all nations that cannot recognize its people diversity shall crumble in its footprint and never rise america the free the just america the great is but a fairytale for blind adults it is a religion at best that revolves around the most intimate of corrupt ideas that it is any different from imperial or a dynasty like the iron curtain put up by the ussr that is what the us has offered the americas
anyone seen minority report cant wait until the technology exist where people get scanned everywhere if youre not in the system police show up let the sanctuary cities go without those systems and see the correlation of crimes committed
it makes sense to build a wallworked great for the chinese to protect them against mongolians i think the right thing is for american and mexican government to band together and stop the drugs they need to work together moreeven if you build the wall you will create just another ring of criminals and actually endanger the lives of many mexicans trying to immigrate to the usathe wall only makes the human trafficking syndicate strongernow if you say that the lives of americans comes first then america should stop all these wars they are fighting outside the usa because it does not affect them in any way get out of syria djibouti etcif you want to save the worldthen also consider building a wall will mean a stronger trafficking syndicate so the best solution is to work with the government of mexico not sure how possible that is
boarders a thing of the past that will not happen and with the growing pressure of illegal immigration boarders will only become harder
thats not how i feel and im from new mexico
technically people constantly sneaking in your country is called invasion i know i dont like invasion
there is already a fence whats the difference its because its too high to climb over or catapult your drugs over isnt it
what kind of drugs was the second guy on
itd be great if there was follow up to change my mind videos it would be nice to see how some of these people feel after some time to think it over
where can i find links to the studies you used good segment but stats are meaningless without citation
 that dude is a complete retard
poor lady 
1030 my boy is living in 2087 the way hes thinking 
soooooohumans are a migratory species and should be allowed to migrate freely to wherever they feel the need to be  ok  id like to migrate to the office on the second floor of the 2nd district us federal reserve in new yorkwould that be ok httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvnrcaqjhi3a
his family has been in america since the 1550s and he sounds like he got his green card a year ago
i live in new mexico and this guy would not get governor 
there already is a wall in some places it has holes in it and its patched up but its there it even extends into the pacific ocean a bit if you want to increase border protection sure go ahead build new wall sections but be aware that the border crosses mountainous areas that make it very hard and expensive to build a wall there it might be cheaper in the long run to have patrols there instead of a wall and no matter how far you extend a wall into the ocean what if you have a boat or what if you dig a tunnelif you want to do something about the drugs problem though maybe lower the demand for drugs by having more social welfare programs increased job security etc so that people are more likely to not end up on the streets where the only refuge they have for their failed american dream is to escape reality into the world of drugsi believe this is why soft drugs can be legally used in my country the netherlands without any problems
first i am for immigration reform but building a wall is pointless hungary built one because of syrian refugees and more than 3500 were getting in daily ask china how well the great wall of china did against invasions  no difference at all whatsoever and its the worlds largest wall us customs and immigration has seen more than 95 of all human trafficking and drugs are coming in through boats not the border also most illegal immigrants come in through flights and overstay their visa humanity has made a habit of tearing down walls including reagan walls have never on either side of the political divide been popular or effective bush started one with obamas approval as he was one of the democrats that voted yes on that bill obama was still taking americans to court to confiscate their land to build the wall which is costing tax payers too much money and farmers are losing their businesses over this bill clinton also instituted operation gatekeeper which restricted the passage of illegal immigrants to san diego from tijuana the program increased the number of border patrol agents in the area and built miles of new fence yes another democrat voted to build a wall along the mexican border time and again both republicans and democrats have tried fences and walls and nothing worked its time for immigration reform just not a wall which is going to cost a lot of money create a lot of hostility and accomplish absolutely nothing but higher taxes to pay for this damned thing
the wall adds property value a house with a fenced in yard is always worth more its  dumb way to look at it but it works for me
sounds like logans run
if you took the xray wall guys iq and multiplied it by 10 and then doubled that number youd have a terrible bowling score
simple building the wall is a huge waste of taxpayer money most people fly over and overstay their tourist visa easiest and least dangerous way to get in also people will find wasys around it theres already tunnels therefore its just a waste of our money
leroy a fool
nooo there is dust under my screen protectot that is so annoying
the face at the end is my reaction to most things in this universe lol
the wall is a dumb idea they will just take a boat from cuba or something if not that use a plane its just a waste of resources rather invest in border officials and coast guards
building a wall isnt going to stop illegal immigration is this dude tarded
i bet this guy crowder has had conversations with folks who have valid points but for some reason or another wont upload them
313 whats the point of whispering if youre doing into a microphone
the people interviewed with you is absolutely nonsense
xray border
i think that guy is on a lot of the drugs he is talking about
that second guy was trying to be smart but really was just a fucking tool
last guy was such an idiot
i whish i could talk with u i dont agree with the wall because although i agree with what is supposed to do it wont change nothing
most immigrants come to the us by plane you dotard
if they are here illegal take out the danger and stigma of the treacherous travel to get here  how by thoroughly vetting each immigrant collecting their biometrics and then slap a stiff 6070 tax for their first 10 years in the us if they have a clean record have a job get educated and pass the citizenship test they become citizens at least well have productive citizens compared to 3rd4th generation welfare recipients who have no desire to get a real job
the problem with a lot of these sit downs is that the people chatting have no idea on how to stay on topic and are ill prepared to use facts to help their points  for example if i had sat down i would argue the wall is a waste of funds as illegal immigrants will find ways around that wall especially the cartels with deep pockets to pay for ways underneath over etc using the money for more manpower and technology to monitor the border would be much more effective  a wall is just a expensive prop used to try and deter people determined to find a way in no matter what  second i would ask why steven and conservatives are not pushing for a wall on the canadian border  why just protect the southern side  if youre going to build a wall why not along every border that is up against another country
why this guy just talks with stupid people
respect to steven for keeping a serious face while talking to the governor that was something
the city of new mexico is a sanctuary cityhey maybe if all this insanity continues ill actually vote him for governor maybe he will let me pilot the drones to drop off the rfid tags to the other side before the people get in the us or maybe i can just guard an xray checkpoint with a lightsaber who knows
the last gentleman thinks people would be okay with being chipped interesting thoughts
the look on stevens face at the end completely conveyed just how terrifying it can be when confronted with the reality of how dumb some people really are
like all these people getting mad about stuff like the walllike come in legally and their would be no problem and their are lots who do it but you have to brake the law and be a criminal and illegal so you cant i repeat so you cant be mad at people for say things bad things about you if you think about itits like if someone broke in your house how would you feel about ityou know nothing about them and you didnt say they could come in but they are still thier just sitting in your living room you would be very unhappy about it you would probably be scared like are they going to hurt or whatso moral of the story is you cant be mad at people if they dont like you or want you in their country because you did go though the paper work to get their and broke in it their countrycause when all is said and done your just a criminalsno offense tho
i dont know if this is true or not but doesnt mexico have a wall at their south borderlike so whats the problem if usa wants onlike no more illegals just come in the right way is it that hard and if it is that hard stay in your own country
what percentage do illigal immigrants commit crime well the clue is in the title  100 as they are breaking the law with their presence
xray border lets call it spooky skeleton border
do multiculturalism doesnt work
what i got from this is some people are stupid
what a pair of inarticulate people it was painful to just listen to them try to finish sentences the guy who claims he will be the governor of new mexico rarely finished his sentences anyway id flee new mexico for sure if i was a resident there lol this is what you get when all you have are poor uneducated people who populate our country stunning
this guy is the dumbest person i ever heard he has no idea what the hell hes talking about he must be a democrat lol  love the xray border idea he came up with  lmao
i think a more ethical way should be done in handling illegal families who are here as for people wanting to enter i think it should be made easier for certain situations ie running away from gang violence single moms etc but i do think the borders should be secure in such a way that should not play into any personal bias unfortunately thats as far as my opinion goes due to the fact that this country has the right to allow in who they want i wish it would be handled more ethically but i wouldnt say the government has to open their walls because its their right i cant blame them for wanting to exclusively allow in those who will add to the economy
i dont want a wall but an rfid chip in everyone that tells your location at all times to a database sounds cool jesus fucking christ
hey steve i like ya and agree with you on most things but uhhh there is a thing called ladders
holy fuck that second guy made me more dumb
the old lady a snitch
isnt one of the reasons that a lot of immigrants come illegally is because its very hard to come legally if it were easier they wouldnt have much of a reason except tax evasion but there are benefits to being legal that i think could outweigh the taxes the wall seems kind of like a waste of resources if people would come on their own to be legal but i dont know if they would
you have no place whatsoever to say a wall shall be built you and your family came here as immigrants we should have built the wall when you filthy disease ridden animals came instead we showed you compassion and showed you how to survive here and what did we get from that
what surprised me the most is how inarticulate that man at the end is scattered thoughts that were whimsical that guy was nauseating to listen to
its hard to understand how that mexican dude is that dumb lets stop them with x rays wtf
dont build a wall just chip all mexicans and track their whereabouts and what dos i think this is the most racist fucking thing ive heard yet
how stupid can one person be
he only really supports controversial opinions and i feel like he says this bullshit to produce shock value
i would have loved to sit down and change your mind
just occurred to me steven must be a trump voter would love for him to discuss with john oliver would get absolutely smashed lol
that xray border guy reminds me of that antman guy
build the wall
lol yeah lets just beem down xrays of deatruction for those foolish enough to cross the border leroy for governor
tbh i say build it
im just gonna put this here httpswwwfactcheckorg201806isillegalimmigrationlinkedtomoreorlesscrime
im confused
back pack guy has been playing to much video games
how can you tax people that work jobs that pay cash
telemundo said trump called all mexicans rapist
very truefake victims create real victims
the wall is symbolic it wont stop it
berlin wall was a great idea praise communism 
is there any episode of change my mind where steven had his mind changed  ive only discovered this series tonight but ive been binge watching episodes for hours  im interested in seeing an area where he decided in the end that his opinion was wrong  if this has never happened even once then im sure people can see the inherent problem with this entire series  he is incredibly well researched and prepared in his arguments but you cant give an mma fighter credit for going 2000 against amateurs they pull in off the street  i love his arguments and my opinion is changed to agree with his every time  but i also see the subjects he debates with being completely unprepared  id be very interested if someone could direct me to an episode where he changed his mind or if someone could direct me to any debates he had with a similarly prepared counterarguer  if neither of those things have ever happened maybe the next step for him would be to do just that  to arrange for debates with actual scholars or politicians versed in the counterpoint
i agree with you on most things but the wall is stupid
yes over tax their illegal asses and then deport them when they least expect it lifetime ban on drug traffickets and human traffickers ms13 is the mexicans trump was talking aboutgiveing them citizenship is not going to work there are 10 million here who have kids here they didnt get citizenship new illegals should not be first nope
that spanish dude should be wearing a dunce hat
i am against ilegal immegration but i think building the wall is just a waste of resources
lmao maybe we can get some xrays to secure the  borders   will have it in like 5yrs lmao
dude with the gopro looks like he has been smoking meth all day
damn im not for the wall im for the xray  digital code scanner wall
love these segments but this one was painful to watch
i totally agree with guy thinking of some way other than the wall to deter illegal immigrants but while thinking how do the wall
but what percentage of the illegal immigrants commit crimes
building the wall would negatively affect the us economy  and it would ruin the ecosystem of the animals that live between the us and mx drugs also get to the us by aircrafts and even aquatic vehicles from the cartels such as the  colombian cartel so its not only mx
really dude xray wont that be astronomically more expensive than a mere mortar and brick
leroy has been thinking alot about this for the past 3 years  lmao he has to sit down with a few mastermind individuals in order to give steven a blatant answer lmfao i am freaking dying dude 
xray digital tag number borders 2025
it useless to build a wall cause mostly ilegal immigrant come to america with tourist visa and hide for 3 year or 4 year stay in america and get the american id with some mean dunno how so it will just waste if tax payer money not to mention how much cost to maintain it
did the guy in white just blow in from stupid town
all i can say is that poor man in the white with the camera has no hope i see that hes trying but yikes
saying illegal aliens are good people is like saying mexico or any other south america country is corrupt crime infested shitholes these countries are shitholes because of the people not the land
i believe that the wall is the stupidest thing ever since a little low percentage of illegal immigration comes from sneaking in i believe that the rhetoric that the wall sends is a symbol of hate cause you dont see a wall in canada or an idea for it you just see it in mexico and down its not the physical wall is the rhetoric and the logic behind it
illegal immigration is particularly useful in a welfare state
the facts that no one mentioned whos going to pay for the wall is crazy to me which is one thing most mexicans are mad about but most illegal people in the us actually did come here leagally they just stayed over the time with visas to think how long it takes a person to become a citizen and how much money it takes should also be a concern even in the process on to becoming a citizen makes you leave this country for even 10 years and like in my case my father would have to leave the country which he doesnt want to do but hes the one maintaining my house hold my mother wouldnt be able to do it alone but building a wall that you want another country to pay for is ridiculous but dont build the wall just on the southern side of this beautiful country build it everywhere and see what happens
had the iq of a grapefruit but was still a nice fellow to chat too
im kinda bummed that nothing interesting was really brought up to the table as far as cost and effectiveness goes
this lady sounds like a complete idiot im a latino pay me and ill help you build it 
lol this fool is tweakin
that guy walked off thinking he made good points
would agree with what last guy said that if you accept the premise that thousands will come illegally no matter what then it would make the most sense for the us gov to make it easier to become a citizen as far as crowders rebuttal that some wont want to pay taxes thousands of american citizens dont pay taxes google it the numbers vary so that argument is weak i think in general more will pay taxes once becoming citizens than wont in addition it seems common sense that people would rather eliminate the threat of deportation ie become citizens than live in limbo with the possibility of deportation hanging over their heads
immigration reform are necessary for us that shit what happens now is not reform and it make a situation eaven worserbut the wall is meaningless in the context of immigration the companies which will build it will make a lot of money from taxpayes by that fraud this is the only goal of this wall 
where theres a will theres a way the people that the wall is built for will find another way to get there plus it would not only be expensive to build but also to maintain and patrol no sure illegal immigration is wrong but i dont think building a wall would change much perhaps looking into ways to encourage legal immigrants to report illegals by offering high incentives or something
the new mexico guy seemed genuinely retarded
with that dude gave them some sort of id so we can tell where they are oh so you mean like hitler did with the jews
personally i dont think we need a wall just sniper towers
hell never become governor
that mexican guy makes no sensechip all the mexican like animals i guesslol
leroy just gave me a damn headache
hahaha that face at the end lololol
it is sad but leroy might just get elected
the look on your face after leroy walked away said everything it needed to say excited to hear about his xray border plan
yes bc  everyone builds stuff with their asses lol ok well buildthewall with our asses
no offense but the guy in the white shirt made me a little angry lol
make a bordr to rival the great wallput high definition cameras and motion sensors allthrough outman the wall completely from one end to one endplease do iti wanna see ur economy go down 
why does the spaniard new mexican add an ah sound to ending of every word ie electronic ideeaahs lmao
all the countries in the middle east should build a wall you cunts have never legally crossed their borders  warmongeringamerica
second dude sounding extra stupid trying to sound remotely smart
leeroy is fucking nuts 
build the stupid wall with no doors or borders and cut free trade with latin america and all stupid agreement you have on cooperation of any kind and take all companies job investment back live in happy in your beautiful usa  shit we know youre racists you would have a wonderful live in the usa and latin americans will happy in our countries without your shit we dont fucking need man and you dont need us this is real nonsense you let this people into your country without proper clearance in immigration and you blame us because you are useless and lazy american fuck you built your wall already and shut up
i came here just to read comments of what people thought about that guy talking with crowder
that was a mess lol
more than 52 of all drugs comes from mexicomostof the crimes arecommited by the illigals criminals from mexico
what a stupid moron if you want to put a chip in your body to track you down than go to north korea
i mean theres already a 16 ft wall w tons of dogs artilleraly and soldiers so whats the point wall is useless and a waste of money for the country also people who are trying to cross the border have been through horrible gang violence and are oppressed to leave their fathers or parents in their country and when they come here they have no money or idea to live as a normal family become oppressors the oppressed become the oppressors
i guess im just a cheap prick 
xray the borders wtf
that guy is an imbecile  he wants to be a governor he couldnt run an elementary school  go run a daycare center buddy
heres a question for all you democrats and those who oppose the wallwhy not just make mexico part of the usa that wayno wall has to be builtthey already have a southern walland no one would be wanting to come herepluswe no longer have to get a visa to take a vacationthen take our militarystart at the rio grandeand move southdrive all the drug cartel into south americathenbuild a wall around californiaturn it into a giant prison like escape from layou commit a serious crimeyou get parachuted in and youre never heard from again
dumbass borders will soon be a thing of the past we should just give all undocumented immigrants a path to citizenshipcrowder how would you do thatdumbass describes a border and legal immigration system
it would have been cool to see an actual good discussion why did he choose these two for the video seriously they cant be the best ones from that day this people are stupid af
that second person is literally all passion and no plan total dimwit
that face 1315 lol
daaaaamn this dude is living in the future he came back from the future 
what a joke this man here is he serious with this bullshit
an xray border wall well i guess he gets an a for imagination
it wouldnt be effective at keeping anyone out simple and plain
yes build the wall around the right
my problem with the wall isnt about immigration its about the economic problem it would cause if after trump there were to be a democrat elected that democrat would probably tear the wall down than another politician would rebuild the wall and the next would tear it down again and it would go on like this for who knows how long all of this would cost big money but it would give political points to whoever the president is
did anyone else google go green global leroy to find out who that guy was lol
why not do a census of areas figure out who is legal and who is illegal afterwards we put a tax on those that are not legal for when they work captialize on their crimes promoting becoming a legal immigrants for those not working we cut welfare it government support from them
build the wallyeti dont see any wall lol fking tards believe this its was a good campaign strategy nothing else
that guy is a fucking idiot i want him out of the coyntry
that guy was definitely mexican lol
any american citizens can walk his feet in almost every centimeter in the map without bank statement or personal interview in embassy no nothing as easy as it can be making troubles causing militarys taking over civil democrats governments and if that cia thing dont work they going to pomp you and leading others to no winer wars murdering millions of people everywhere and now you are the one who try to keep others outpleeeeease by the way you are welcome any time any where if your name isnt donald j trump or joe pesci 
i mean dont get me wrong i agree that we should enforce our borders but to build a wall thats pretty extreme
i hate racism and that they think usa is just for whiteman but mexican cant fight cause they have a wall for guatemala
an xray machine the length of the usmexico border you just made this issue a global warming issue too gotta burn some fossil fuels to run that size machine
mexican conservative here build your wall its an excellent idea for your countrys security but you pay it with your money
how in the hell are they gonna build an xray wall with id tags that is so idiotic this guy is a freaking moron
whoawherever you got that crime statistic about immigrants is bogus  if we are getting that much violence from people coming across the borders thats an act of war  we dont need a wall we need military action lol  the problem with building a wall is that its first economically irresponsible  the border should be protected and well regulated  dont get me wrong  however the amount of money materials contracting planning and continuity of border patrol operations during the process along with protecting the wall is simply irrational to consider  some terrains would be next to impossible to build a wall upon  honestly if we worked with these countries like mexico guatemala honduras and others to help expedite the legal process of immigration we would probably cut down on a lot of these issuesbeing a black man pledging unwavering allegiance to any country is a tall order for me  seriously the second i find another country that suits me and my familys needs and expectations ill leave  america stopped improving and rested on its laurels  i agree that immigration needs to be a high priority but i think it should be handled with humanity not solely legality
im an immigrant from mexico i was 7 years old when my mother brought my sister and me to the us i join the marine corps right after high school and became a us citizen i completely agree with building the wall i recently subscribed to your channel and i was hoping you would do a segment on immigration that was actually a good job i just wish that i would have been more people would have participated it would have been nice to see a liberal democrat being interviewed but they didnt step up to the hot seat theyre afraid of facts 
fuckin mexicans are retarded im not mexican im spanish my family has been in mexico since the 1500s that means you are mexicans mexico is a country not a race if you were born in mexico you are mexicans and if youre family was spaniard unless they were only fuckin each other you arent even close to being spanish just thinking that a handful of spaniard people were in mexico hundreds of years ago makes you spanish is retarded the spanish was bread out of the bloodlines hundreds of years ago you are natives with a little white in you
okay guy number one was not getting it you cant identify or give people and identification if you dont have a way to stop them from coming in before we can snatch them up and identify or give them identification
will i change your mind if i say for every tall wall there is a taller ladderif a wall cost you 20 billion and can be defeated by a 20 ladder will i change your mindwhat if i tell you that walls only work to keep away terrestrial animals because they dont have the intelligence to defeat it humans on the other hand are intelligent and will find ways to cross it with ease we have been to the moon we have explored the dept of the ocean but somehow you think that a wall is going to stop intelligent beings from crossing it ok then build it and then watch how to useless it becomesno one sat to argue with you because nobody wants to argue with idiots
i want this guy from new mexico to live in a house without walls and have everyone who wants to get in to walk through his xray machine
your face at the end said it all lol i want no boarders but maybe an xray boarder yeah ok buddy
there already is a wall it should say build another wall cuz we dont like brown people
did the guy actual promote tagging humans like animals
you want to be the governor of new mexico my dude maybe in your little scifi world where you tag illegal  aliens and use scanners for people to go through xray machines and then youll just give them social security numbers and make them take the test to be legal when did they make weed legal in new mexico because my dude you are on some strong shit
2nd personmans is living in his own little sci fi world
that dude sounds like hes describing the plot to the matrix
build the wall with your ass wtf lol
xray border guy dear lord
ohpeople are fucking idiots
leroy is a complete idiot he sounds like the the coyote just dropped him off even though he was born in the country and he randomly mention random ideas like he is high the governor of new mexico what a tool
im not mexican ive been in new mexico since the 1500s ok dude when new mexico was mexico for the longestok
look man i personally believe the wall isnt practical because most people come plane so i dont think a huge wall would be practical like im for extra defense on the border but a huge exspensive wall is just not practical
this one is really easy to answer if usa wants a wall then they can have it but dont expect than other country pay for your stupid bullshit
mannnnnn that spanish dude was dumb
im not even 20 seconds in and im rofl
america is already making money off of illegal immigrants take a look at tysons factory workers produce pickers construction workers most come to the united states to work
change my mind is a thought provoking debate kudos steven
love the shirt steven
illegal immigrants dont spend money here or pay taxes most of their money is sent back to mexico honorably for their families but that doesnt help our economy at all
what better way to stop people from dragging their kids on a dangerous journey having to give the females birth control cause there is a good chance they will get raped on the way here what better way to stop that and make them come legally if there is a wall they wont even make the journey unless they know they will get in  not having a wall is dangerous to people in the long run i got 100 on that wall right now
xray border has got to be the worst idea i have ever heard
climate change is a myth change my mind
the green global idiot was probably the stupidest one ive seen on change my mind
in that opening clip when she leaned in i was just about to take a drink when she said that xd  cant just sneak in funny shet without warning p gotta let us ready ourselves850 people will be traveling super fast hang on tell me more of this how are we going super fast are we injecting sonic genes1030 some kind of xray scanner  satellites   like a string of satellites watching the boarders other then costing a shet ton of money to build and maintain that it might be possible maybe those invisible walls for keeping animals in your yard we could adapt that tech for this issue still seems really expensive to set up and maintain though
that icehead was an idiot 
you need to check for idiots i want to deport this moron his family came in the 1550s that was enough for me to toss him
lol
i agree with the guy in the white shirt to just let them in and then tax them just like americans these people want to be here and they want to work and they want the same dream as i do and all americans
wow
elitist liberals love walls when they are used to protect their gated communitiesinterestingly enough the guards protecting those leftist gated communities make the mexican landscapers go through a lot of security before allowing them in it is almost as if they dont want brown people in their communities if they are not going through the proper channels
are they building a wall to keep them out or keep us in
until the 3year and 10year bans on illegal immigrants are a thing of the past a wall isnt going to stop people from trying to get in if you look at the current immigration laws you will see that there are some ancient devices in place that really make it tough for illegals to become legal if you are illegal and you choose to try and persue becoming a legal citizen then you are choosing to roll the dice on wether you will be allowed to stay here while you go through the legalization process or wether you are going to get hit with a 3 to 10 year ban before you are allowed to even begin the process of legalization during those 3 to 10 years you will be in your country of origin and if you for any reason choose to come back before your ban has been lifted the ban is reset come back one day early without permission spend another 3 to 10 years enjoying being away from your family and loved ones i have one more year left on my mothers ban before im allowed to request her visa and another two years for my fathers  they paid taxes owned a home and raised three christian children who pay taxes and contribute positively to society my sister is going to school to be a nurse and my brother just passed his police academy entrance exams if i believed that the wall was going to  make it easier to change the current immigration laws then id say build the wall but the truth is the only thing that is going to reform those laws are people understanding them in their current state and understanding why there is a need for reform
wow you must be desperate for content letting that bloke talk for so long
these people are dumb as hell
is leroy on drugs 
i dont  think  building a wall will fixes  anything it would just be a waste of money because smugglers will smuggle thats what  they do  and  most of the drugs come over the border or under or the sea the  solution is to legalize all drugs
the wall will make it far safer for immigrants  no more widespread rapes human trafficking drug muling exposure deaths etc
how about instead of building a wall we build a roof because mi casa es tu casa 
you cant make anyone legal citizens of any country if you dont have a border
illegal immigrants commit 37 of the homicides now thats some fake news
military on boarder and wall we can secure it walls work
oh that spanish dude that actually physically hurt also the look at the end killed me
in the mexico us boarder they cant build a wall cus they will kill all the wild life its really hot down here and the wild life has to get water from the river and stuffif you build a wall you kill nature
they should build a wall on the canadianus boarder more ppl come illegally from that side
the thing he didnt mention about this whole wall thing which i think is more important is who is paying for the wall and the fact that most illegal immigrants came on airplanes and overstayed visas the wall is just a propaganda scheme that we the tax payers are gonna have to pay for
use the money for education so someone can figure out a way to control immigration properly we know damn well that the wall wont do shit in the long run they will figure out any way to get in stop kidding yourselves fix the system
an xray boarder lmao
i would die to talk to you and destroy every arguement you make
you are so unbelivably arrogant and delusional
sounds like you lost this onea wall might make you feel safe but in reality your not safepeople that go into the country for work will probably be more than willing to be tagged and traked people who smuggle drugs in wont so as soon as those are caught they get special tracking wall or not people have addictions and the demand is high of illegal drugs and legal drugs is its not illegals then its your own government  but i agree build that wall just so people can say we told you so
was this the only guy that sat down with you my good sir i wish one day me and you can sit down like that with or without cameras because this guy wasnt even a person worthy of your time god bless
dang it crowder i wish i was closer id love to sit down and have a chat  we would agree on some points but most tell me im not very agreeablemy opening argument is usually if almost all of south america is such a bad position  then isnt it our given responsibility to fix it and it doesnt matter much on how they answer because the follow up is wouldnt it get fixed faster with the american flag and then it gets easy really easy1 if you are trying to get into america because the united states opportunists and government is better that is the reason for us to liberate mexico and make it all the usa2 if you are coming into america because we need asylum from our government great we should put up our flag in your country put down a military station set for defense and then liberate your country3 if you are coming into america because you want to invade the free world and cripple our government then youre government needs to be reigned and let know that this is the same as war either stop your citizens from illegally marching into our country because you their government does not have the capability of caring for them or deal with much harsher realities if you want to come in come in the right way id hate for your country to suffer war or annexation simply because you were to lazy or impatient to go through legal processes if the legal process is indeed to long and the multitudes of your country are waiting then put up the us flag and we will be their quickly whats your thought crowder get louder djb
white shirt dude has no idea what hes talking about
lol this guy doesnt want a wall but he wants them to be chipped tracked and check points everywhere doesnt believe in borders but wants a whole police state in america but without borders which basically means take over mexico so they can have their electronic permission slip before entering the x ray border this guy make absolutely no sense
are you a trump suporter steven
she wants no wall so the drugs can still get in
i just think its a waste of money it wont stop much from coming in anyways there has to be a better way
i really hope that lady is safe and and those people have been deported and sentenced
the only reason why i am against the wall is because of the animal especies that migrate from mxico to the usa annually but i as a mexican do believe illegal migration is to be stopped without racism agression etc you cant stop violations to the law with more violations to the law or rights
xray border so everyone from another country already has a chip implanted in them so we can conveniently track them where do i start
this dude is pretty much asking for big brother in order to secure the borders
im mexican build the wall buld a fucking glass dome around your country if you want to with your money of course
that 2nd guy lives in a fantasy world from building an xray wall to traveling faster then planes in the next 5 years
stevencrowder you should make a video titled  reinstate slavery change my mind you fuckin racist whip lashing crackah
i really wish someone with a brain would have sat down and actually had competent ideas not just excuses and opinions no knowledge of facts i wish i could host my own my first one would be backyard chickensroosters should be banned change my mind lol i have this exact issue in the suburbs and the local codes havent been updated in centuries fml
x ray border lol
illegal  immigrants for the most part are a bi product of washington foreign policy mainly regime change of all these countries  fix that first
yes illegal immigration has been a problem and i support enforcing our borders but building a wall is only going to further add to the national debt and create a market for really tall ladders
build the wall who else will make our cheap wal mart things american companies sent the factories to china mexico etc pass the nafta then militarized the border what a timing right the us consumes the most drugs and the cartels get all the guns most of the time from the us the us has overthrown governments by force and supported it the american indians should have built a wall  go ask them
the guy who can barely think wants to be governor sounds like a plan
leeeeroy jackass
he hurt my brain wow smh
dude shouldve prayed for a sinkhole beneath him
make money off of them 
507 i cant believe it hahahahahah
imma be the govener and scientifical is a word
the big misunderstandings lie in what the people want who want the wall or stricter border security it isnt that they dont welcome immigrants they just want them to come here legally do it the right way pay taxes like those of us who live here and dont milk a system that we builtthe misdirection applied by the left is to avoid logical and procedural discussions because they dont have an argument there and make it emotionalso youre for splitting up families no but i am for punishing criminals illegal immigrants are just that  illegal if that results in a dad being separated from his kids well thats no different than a guy who robs a convenience store and goes to prison therefore missing out on his kids growing up stop calling it undocumented immigrants like its a clerical errorbut he just wanted to be here to make a better life for his kids how is that a crime wanting to do that isnt a crime finding an illegal way to do it is a crime laws and emotions are completely separate things and emotions have no business dictating law law is meant to be impartial while emotions are 100 partial if they want to make a better life for their kids then work hard for it like those of us who are parents here have to keep a clean record and come here legally there will be opportunityamericans are pro immigration innovation and competition come from immigration but we also believe you should abide by the same laws taxes and competition as the rest of us
wow just wow
holy crap was he retarted
tag them with id tags that tracks where they go  funny he is worried about the human rights of criminal aliens yet has no issue and even recommends tagging them with electric id tags and tracking them like your household  pets rfid tag something right out of adolph hitlers nazi germany or stalins communist russia   this is what 25 years of democrat backed union controlled public school teachers have been doing while you were too busy worrying wars in the middle east your retirement and keeping a roof over your kids heads please folks get involved with your local schools
id have to get a few mastermind individualizes and get an xray laser scanner thing   im in over my head  i know nothing about what we are talking about other then i am suppose to say i dont like border walls like the main stream media tells me every day manufactured outrage works every time
hummm just tax every one that comes in umm who is going to pay that if places like mexico had money their citizens wouldnt be living in poverty fleeing for america the mexican people are to blame for their countries misfortune no one else they chose to allow their governments and cartels to disarm and enslave them over the last century an here is why people are so anti illegal  you come here illegally find a way to stay then end up voting for the same type of liberal promise you everything free politicians that run your country into the ground just look at the major cities illegals flee to they are all broke bankrupt overloaded with homeless crime ridden drug infested shit holes an who are their politicians liberal democrats like the ones i mention above promising everything free and telling you that you deserve something mean time i have been engaged to a filipina for 4 years 2 12 of which we have spent waiting and trying to get through the line of getting her here legally we both believe using fiance visa is wrong and leads to marrying someone you because you have to
that guy is a fucking moron  no borders just a star trek xray scanner that scans people  as they traverse the desert what a dumb shit
 omg that bitch
my mind has been changed by simple logic that the first girl brought up good on her
that woman has a plant in her drink
the wall would cost a fuckload of money
wish i could find u and have a talk im an independent and we agree and disagree on many things itd be a great conversation
i covered my eyes and cringed when the dude from new mexico starting speaking about xray borders with id tags
this nigga so dumb wants an xray border
he said he wants to be governor of new mexico if he is a representive of new mexico god help them people
stupid videoyou dont open your mind so people can change your mindyou only want to reaffirm your opinionyou dont have to change your mind but let other people speak and shut the fuck up and listen for once
the us played a big role in helping tear down the berlin wall so why would we repeat history and build one here at home
what source is the they commit 37 of the homicides comment from ive been trying to fact check but havent had amy luck i only want the source not trying to argue any position
i am not an american but i do love build the wall policy because my state is sandwich between two countries and the problem we face is illegal immigrants and illegal guns drug like meth and heroin  and gold smuggling are our problems but the govt started to do some fencing at the borders and i really supported to it it is not like building a berlin wall where you cant cross it if you are legally want to cross the border you can cross it but you have to go through some check points where the border force guarded the points the only thing is not all the borders have fence
im spanish yeah he doesnt look like a spaniard and he sounds like a mexican american cholo all he needs to do is say holmes
personally i believe the world is  divided enough i understand territories provinces countries but this world inhabits us people people are the same and this planet belongs to all of us its our job to nurture it the way that it has nurtured us also everybody having chips sounds cool but there will be no such thing as privacy at that pointworld council anyone
send dem mexican rapist back lmao
i think the guy with the camera is literally retarded hes one of these people that talks just to hear their own voice
reads titleoh thisll be fun
im disappointed that youd want the wall built from the videos ive seen you base your beliefs in logic yet you cant see that the wall is no more than a symbol used to incite an inflammatory effect the notion of a physical wall symbolizes safety and protection houses have walls for shelter the same way a castle has outer walls to keep away intruders well to a person inside those walls the provider of the walls in this case trump as it was a move on behalf of his presidential campaign is viewed as a provider of protection and safety however it does demonize all people trying to immigrate legally or illegally a better use for not only the funds that would be necessary to build a physical wall but the energy it incites in people with heavy preconceptions would be a more effective immigration infrastructure sadly something that necessary is also immensely complicated and doesnt sound so sexy in a hatechant it just doesnt sell as well  as build that wall
i believe many people migrate to the united states from other countries illegally because of the poverty from there native countries or the harsh living conditions they might be having to face in there countries for example lots of people pro building the wall like to target mexican people but in reality they are not the only illegal immigrants in the us and many people argue that mexicans bring a lot of drugs into the us but if we actually look at the history of drug smugglers peru and columbia were really the ones making mass amounts of drug money and they were smuggling the drugs by plane boats and other forms of trafficking so how much will building a wall really protect the smuggling of drugs if that wasnt even there preferred choice of drug smuggling also before when weed was considered an illegal drug that people would get convicted many years in jail for selling which now is taxable and is being legalized through out the us this makes me question whether the us can claim anything to be legalized as long as they can make money of the product such as weed or cigarettes or alcohol we all know all those things are also bad for your health and are addicting but as long as uncle sam gets his cut it can be legalized but back to the original point is considering why are there so many illegal immigrants and it all goes back to the same thing everyone regardless of where you are from believe in the american dream and they come to this country in hopes of having a new begging and prospering for there family and many immigrants do try to legalize there status here in the us are denied by the thousands and thousands every year being an illegal immigrant in this country brings obstacles that they have to deal with everyday that a legalized person will not face so many the real problem is not the illegal immigrants but the standards that are set in place as to who qualifies to be legalized perhaps if they allowed more people the opportunity to be legalized in the us as the second guy mentioned the us could profit of the work they already are taking here and have them pay taxes and have more opportunities for the illegal immigrants as well another factor is a lot of illegal immigrants are also in fear of being denied and then deported back to there country and being ripped apart from there family here in the us many people in other countries are so poor that even there parents force them into prostitution as children like in china for example other people are scared to be killed by narcos like in mexico other people are scared of dictators like in cuba the reality is that the majority of people that come to this country come in hopes of a new life and america was founded on immigrants when christopher columbus found the americans he paved the path for european exploration when europeans came to this country and killed all the native americans and the ones they didnt kill they rapped they didnt come here with permission from the native americans they didnt get a visa or a green card they too came as illegal immigrants the truth is unless you are native american someone in your ancestry came here as an illegal immigrant at some point and because of them you can know live a better life with more rights than in many other countries
these antiwall people are a stupid an xray border new mexico is a sanctuary city i couldnt do that job of interviewing these hispanic mental giants
fun video i found today not sure if youve seen it but it gave me a giggle httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv2u4vlgr2ihs
iq 3000
shame shoe shame gowder he is to low iq to interview
i live on the boarder and i would be able to see the wall if i would stand on my roof  so im against the damn wall but i would rather have then use all that money for more security like cameras drones and just man power or whatever but not a freaking wall
there is already a friggen wall where was this shit being piled on obama supporters
i feel bad because that guy was nice and had some cool ideas but they were way too far fetched
are there no basic questions about the logistics of building a physical wall there is already a wall there it just couldnt be finished because it became stupidly expensive and made lots of problems with claims to the land its built on drug cartels are resourceful build them a wall and they buy planes dig tunnels catapults and invest in better mules if you didnt build a wall you could invest that money into supporting mexican anticartell efforts maybe you could invest in outreach programs in mexico try and offer mexican youth better jobs in mexico theres a big trade war going on with china maybe you could build factories in mexico to produce the same crap china did
trash hes not interviewing well informed ppl
where r those statistics need them
when i am older i want to move to the usa from the uk and i go to an selective grammar school i get good grades and i want to follow in a career in chemistry while studying music production it just makes me sad because the wait period is so long and everything
the first girl was actually retarded
2nd guy is an uneducated mutt
lol
haha i like this spanish kids futuristic xray border plan  haha
that guy is a complete idiot
im a democrat but this is some good shit hes really smart and i appreciate what hes doing normalizing respectful and peaceful debates like this
the best way to stop illegal immigration is allowing people to become us citizens easier lol simple a wall costs too much money and is ridiculous
new rule nobody can leave
its a shame the lady couldnt do her change my mind unedited i get why of course but she seemed an intelligent women the dude seemed straight up dumb as fuck
how do you report these people mexican lady called ice steveni died haha
does he mean we should build a wall or shouldnt cause we shouldnt because just wait until someone like mao or stalin with the iron curtain comes in it might be a good idea now until that person comes into officebut i do think we should have better border control
fucking beaners come here and think they better than americans i have worked with some before they all think they hard core tough and gangster i say to them why you come here why not stay and make it better then they talk shit then i slap the shit out of them beaners back over the wall they are very disrespectful to veterans
the face at the end says it all
all these ppl are arguing emotionally
what was leroys last name i want to find this dude
the short strait mexican with the camera is killing me he wants to talk but knows jack shit wtf is this dude doing hes worth less than a illegal mexican i would trade him any day for any illegal mexican
why do they pick the dumbest hispanic  and interview him
building a wall would just minimize mexican illegals but it wont stop illegals what people dont realize is that many come legally and when their visa expire they chose to stay as illegals because its such a hassle to renew a visa
what about those working under the table tax free sending it back to mexico claiming ten relatives and the family pet for the tax credits
what soes he think about the millions of illegals on welfare using tax dollars not paying them
so the solution for illegal drugs is to let them flow in unhindered no thanks europe sid that to china as a way to enslave them
so this guy thinks we can tag everyone if they wont come through ports of entry  what makes him think they will  allow themselves to be tagged
xray borders 
your face at the end discribed it perfectly
all lives matter change my mind  much love from the uk keep up the great work 
i wonder if the new leftists mexican president will dismantle the southern wall
eh i say build it
his spanish family from spain has been in new mexico since the 1500s bruh
doesnt matter if they dont bring drugs or not  they came illegally  if they came legally thered be no problem
the best argument against democracy is a fiveminute conversation with the average voter 
steven  so ur against illegal immigration  woman  no but i dont want them to build a wall
personally i think stricter air control and more federal funding to the border control would do more than a wall would do most illegals come here via airplane or overstay on their visas so a wall is just a waste of time and money
wow so this dude essentially wants to microchip people lets do it
im one day planning to be the gouvernour of new mexico he doesnt even get a fucking sentence straight and talks about implant chips into people  like dogs who tend to run away so they dont have to cross an actual border wtf
with all love and respectsteven deflects the bigger picture just as leroy was making a connection
lets build an xray border and implant all potential immigrants a chip so the fucking border recognizes that you crossed it yeah lets just pay for taking south americans to their local vet and get that shit implanted in every one of themoh and better make an fancy app for it in which you can state the reason of you crossing and post some nice edgy foreign memesthats some fucking holocaust softcore version right here
the guy he interviewed was really talking out his ass wtf
what an idiot can he even speak english
i liked this niggas videos but this shit is retarded dont do this shit
crowder for president
if this guy is protrump how come is he wearing a shirt of a foreign arms manufacturer if you like those shirts better start stacking them up before trump places tariffs on garments too
ive never heard a coherent argument against the wall and was hoping this change my mind segment would rectify that to put it politely lets just say that definitely did not happen
what exactly happened lol my mind just broke
brownpride cant stop us wont stop us were taking over 
how would you know what percentage of illegals there are in the country if theyre undocumented
im a mexican living in mexico i never had the necessity to emigrate out of my own country  and honestly i dont think americans should be dealing with mexicans that prefer to leave their own country instead of doing something to improve their own lives i used to earn 1400 pesos per week and i started to study english in order to improve my own life and im earning 2400 pesos per week which may not be a fortune but its enough to have a decent life
the second guy autistic
watch the adam ruins everything on the wall it might change your mind
this was painful  crowder has the patience of a saint  leroy was something special
not a lot maybe a couple  just tag them give them a social and tax them after you xray them somebody is confusing scifi movies and reality  wow just wow
an x ray border where every immigrant is tagged and has a written excuse
that second guy was all over the place like 39 red bulls and a pound of pixie sticks all over the place
does anyone know where he found the statistics about 3 make up 37 of the murders
the us stole the southwest from mexico in the first place how do you presume to exclude mexicans from reclaiming their property rights
the guy is such an idiot please someone deport him
white shirt has way too much faith in illegal immigrants and smoked a little bit too much weeda
i just wish you found someone informed its like speaking to children
the wall wouldnt do anything it would be huge waste of money it would take  years to completely build it and it is a fact the wall would be insufficient i do agree there should be stricter on the people who bring drugs but should let those who will work here and would not do crimes
that second guy is a total embarrassment to new mexico unfortunately there are a lot of stupid people like him that live here
maybe you could could have like an xray and scan everybody and track em all yknow dude yeah or like a unicorn crowder yeah exactly like some kind of magic way to solve this i dont have the idea fully formulated yet ill have to talk to some scientists dude
im spanish my family has been in new mexico since 1550 or whatever you know considering that what is now new mexico had not been colonized my americans until the enactment of the northwest ordinance of 1787 i have a feeling hes lying
the second guy omg im cringing so hard i had to stop watching
a nation that cannot control its borders is not a nation that being said wont ms13 and drug cartels find other ways into the country
its so easy to show these people the truth and put them on the right path theyre ignorant but its not theyre fault  extremists from the farleft those peple cant be changed theyre minds are corrupted
its pretty funny how almost every leftists believe that the wall is bad even though they would agree to deport criminals just because it was trumps idea they completely skipped the logical thinking process part and goes straight to their biasemotions
trump and his administration are already building a better wall it is going to cost us trillions but in return we will keep more money in our country every illegal immigrant is sending their money home they cant keep it here because they could be deported any day they cant even open a bank account and i really find it distrurbing that legal immigrants dont understand how an economy works marijuana being legal would cut down on alot of trafficking but at the same time other drugs are still going to be sought after if you disagree with a liberal on any topic they get angry and defensive it is hard to persuade someone who is never going to accept their president because they lost in an election
his face at the end love your videos man
im not mexican im spanish nah bro you dont look like any spanish people ive seen
what if someone cuts out ur tracker chip and sabatouges it
with americas already crumbling infrastructure i think it would be a waste of money to spend billions of dollars on a wall illegals come in in all ways from tunnels swimming being stuffed in dash boards the boarder goes over mounting ranges rivers you name it you build a 30 foot wall theyll make 31 foot ladders i guess im saying is i disagree that a wall would stop people from illegally entering the us
this dude is spanish  and he has that accent  and his family came in the 1500s wtf  he doesnt look spanish to me
immigrants should be granted a social security number and taxed  and they must gain w2 employment or 1099  no cash work  there should be an accelerated program of say 2 years to provisional citizenship  and they should have to pass an english test and us history test and swear allegiance to the usa but provisional  any felony committed and they would lose this provisional status and be deported  after 2 years of provisional citizenship they would be made full citizens  and in addition i do not think they should be able to vote after becoming legal for at least 4 years  this does several things that could 1 spurn the practice of these people being taken advantage of and also not paying taxes  2 create an easier path to citizenship 3 ensure immigrants arent being used as political pawns
bunch of hyperemotional idiots theres nothing wrong in enforcing your problems the wall would save the us so much money the price would be a fraction of what illegal immigration costs the taxpayer in a year its a smart long time investment
i know you cant really see it but its kinda funny her face was blurred but her photo id tag wasnt
so how do you intertwine the wall idea on immigrants coming in via plain build a netshould every country with intergration problems build a freakin wall as well how would the world look like remember the chinese or should we maye just maybe look at how to improve the integration system
i would appreciate if you left stupid town this people cant even form a sentence i get it some have heavy accents because their main language is different from english but the second guy is just borderline pun intended stupid
wants to be governor cant formulate simple thoughts
he should debate with jaclyn glenn
do a trump should be reelected change my mind
the mexican dude is on some star wars technology type shit 
hi leftist here im not as informed about this as i could be but from what i gather the reason that makes the most sense to me is it costs a shit ton of money im not for illegal immigration whats another solution  i dont know more border security i guess
i feel like these people dont seem to realize that the wall will still have checkpoints to come in from and go into mexico theyre not going to brick over those parts
dont hate trump yet change my mind
these can be painful to watch steven crowder
that look at the end killed me 
the second guy seemed overly optimistic about the lack of a border and perhaps poorly informed about what this system would entail but at the same time i can respect that hes got the best interests as he sees them of the community at heart that and he was completely respectful and even enthusiastic refreshing to see
you know immigrants come to the usa for a better life and yalls reasoning why immigrants are not fair is because we dont pay taxes that could easily change if someone just makes a law that makes every property store job etc as a tax included but of course people like trump will come out with another idea of why illegals are bad for the usa for my understanding most illegal workers are payed way less than an usa citizen when working in fields in my opinion that says a lot
leeroy is a complete clueless fool
everyone go to your own country  where you belong america has a problem of increasing unemployment rate still dumb americans support the illegal or legal immigrants lmaoremember feelings for tribe race will never end in this world wake up dumb americans
waste of money it would best be put into education and also with a wall it would be 10x easier to jump
lmao first one is all over the place
that second guy sounded stupid im mexican living in the united states and honestly i definitely think we need a wall as well as immigration reform like new people coming in illegally create problems for us that are trying to live our lives
ya they bring drugs i dont like those choice of words he made it sound like it was everyone in general
wow the xray guy is a tard
i work hardharder than about 75 of people who believe they work hardas a citizen of the usa i see no extra help to pay medical or financial assistance if i asked money from our govtwhich i do noti must prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that i may need govt assistancei know of a document that our govt paid an immigrant to come here and start a businesslots of moneyits sad for me and open eyed americans to swallowand if you disagree with me we can expect that you are a fascist who does not see the big picture but just your here and now pathetic needsif this is you i really want to hear you change my mind
would the xray boarder cost more than the wall ctfu
as a mexican i agree the us have the right to build a wall with their own money though maybe it could be crowdfunding project
the spanish dude said no border and his suggestion was xray id tags  or them basically wearing id like the jews star of david
i like what that guy said about taxing them to get rid of illegal immigration maybe fining mexicans or even mexico every time they are caught with out legal papers i do think that especially when we can vet people  immigration should be as quick and easy a process as possible right now it costs thousands and takes over 10 years to be a citizen ridiculous
how many people were actually interviewed  how many  with good points were left out of the interview
steven crowder for president 1 like 1 vote
can someone comment a legit argument against it please
send these lame worthless taco eatin gangmembers
my gosh i really really wish you had blocked this womans complete body for her own safety from the sounds of it she would have to worry if they found out she was saying something the clothes and purse can be easy to identify people plus her actual voice smh  as a 1st generation mexican american believe me she has to worry if they recognise her
lolyou should have stopped the debate before he made a complete idiot of himselflol that was sad to watchespecially when he said he is planning on running for governor one daysmfh
fucking xray lazer scannergood idea
that spanish nigga sound so uneducatedpfff
if you allow people to carry firearms and if theres no welfare state you dont need a border and thats good because immigration provides competition in the labour market
100 of illegal immigrants have committed a crime
leeroy was all over the fucking place
could you do this topic but on a college campus or with more educated people these people were off putting lol
i have a idea we tax all packages mail and money grams and banking transfers to mexico 50 could be wrong about it but sounds good to me
i love that the people were like screw the wall and not even making a argument lol makes people that are pro illegals look really smart 
xray scanner
mexicanamerican here i really dont care all this talk about the wall and i havent heard or seen anything go up besides prototypes so when is it going up trump supporters
im just gonna be straight up honest the wall is completely useless you think a wall will stop or slow down the crossings of such criminals or illegals the idea does not bother me since i dont stand by illegal immigration however the wall to me sounds like a complete money waste knowing crossing on land isnt the only way this happens
personally i dont think a wall would work that well the us and mexico border is very large and would cost a lot of money to build it keep it up and employing all the security to monitor the wall i would like to see more focus on getting the illegal immigrants already in the us out though is anyone has any examples of a wall succeeding in doing its job then please tell me
the hispanic woman is fucking retarded
he is for freedom but wants a wall around the country brilliant
if you want to build a wall with private land and  go for it but if you want to use thefttaxation to pay for a big government program youre not really a conservative
so we all just get rfid implants and get scanned by robots as we cross the borders that no longer exist did i get that right do i need the tag to participate in society buy food drive etc hmn where have i heard a similar story before
that hispanic dude is like a retarded argument generator
just wow
that spanish guy was dumb af dont have boarders or walls but id people with an x ray electronic id tag that scans you and monitors where you go in the area thats like something out of a sci fi movie he would rather get chipped and tracked then just secure boarders with regulations or putting up walls wth
why build the wall america will spend a lot ass of money think about maintenance too and mexicans still will go to the us
that face at the end  oh leroy you sweet idiot
that face at the end  oh leroy you sweet idiot
this kids a moron and he wants to be the governor of new mexico lol
bring on the wall best thing ever people are sheep and brainwashed they only go along with what theyve been told through constant social propaganda they cant even explain their reasons without sounding stupid
1025 stevens face expression when he said xray scanner haha
build the wall but not build phisical wall the title is misleading
as a mexicanamerica i believe the wall is a dumb idea because not only will it create a bigger problem than what it is now there is no stopping those who are willing to sacrifice anything to get to america and i also agree with that spanish dude technology will just advance and so will people i say let trump build the wall time will only tell what really is going to happen
lets keep it old school and build a wall it will work and it will be tremendous believe me
and if you think a wall will stop immigrants that  come from south america like el salvador and ecuador ect that have walked and jumped on trains for thousands of miles just to get away from the horrible crime that is happening in their country and to make money to support their family then you are wrong my friend they will do whatever it takes to try and cross even if they have to go on a boat and cross through sea
a wall will never work because drug smugglers are finding new ways to bring drugs in el chapo drug cartel brought all their drugs through underground tunnels so i dont see how the wall would even protect us the cartel will do anything to bring in drugs you can fly over a wall btw lol cant put a wall in the sea so you can snuggle drugs through that lol a wall is a waste of money to be honest just get more patrols and train them better bring in better equipment to track them down with radar or night vision or whatever use drones whatever honestly i think all those are way better options then a stupid wall
37 of murders are created by immigrants hahaha where the fuck did you get that false statistics
that man is on one lol
god that guy was stupid
its amazing that the system for becoming a usa resident has been the same over the last 80yrs or more i dont even know but until all the fake news stories were published by cnn and others now people want to say something bad aboutyes wait for it our president donald trumpthank god for him
omg the guy with the show literally described every policy we currently have in place for gaining citizenship and topped it of with make them srsly scares me this guy is voting
tax illegal immigrants good luck getting them to give up no taxes and free healthcare
well i agree with the wall because its not like all mexicans cant enter to the usa the only ones who cant enter are the ones without papers but i disagree with us mexicans having to pay for that wall
got to get me one of those xray scanners 
that face when you ask yourself about wtf you just sat through
the second guy was hopped up on something
second guy has no clue keep it simple and build a wall while minimizing the amount of illegal entry and deport all the ones that are already here illegally with a ten year reentry ban
republican but i dont want the wall since coyotes and other smugglers will still find ways around and only get more customers and it could cause some environmental issues but i do agree with enforcing and increasing border and immigration control
that xray idea is solid why didnt i think of that
i dont agree with building the wall many illegal immigrants work in amercia and contrbute just very harshly punish and jail the ones who dont work or who commit crimes
that guy is living in a scifi fantasy world where everyone has electronic identification and can go wherever they want as long as they have their skull chips lmao
i feel like by building a wall its aimed at mexicanlatinos its doesnt really solve it i go deported and was in a detention center there was a lot of nationalities russia india ukraine africa even the uk some came illegally some legal dont know where i went with this
signing up for welfare and then sending all the money you make off the booksworking back across the border doesnt sound like a good tax policy
a xray scanner to what the was that guy on drugs
path to citizenship and join us in america boyz we love all colors and creeds we hate freeloaders
where is this guy getting his stats from most illegals are just hard working and dont do any more crime than a regular citizen i know he wants to believe brown skinned people are worse but its not truth
even a fence spanning the border is costly and ineffective private property waterways and even towns sit on the border itself and a wallbarrier itself is not enough toprevent immigrationyou may think it could at leastlimit the areas needing patrolled butyou need people along the wall securing it from being tampered with and worked around the cost of a wall the likes of which trump or his ilk boast they will buildwould be astronomical and still would likely not be effective the most likely scenario is billions of taxpayers dollars sunk into a partially completed construction zone along the border anyone thinking a foreign country is going to pay for the wall is just simply delusionali am not for open borders i am not for illegal immigration i am not even a liberal i am for finding a solution that is feasible effectiveand affordable that solution is not a wall change my mindengineer fiscal conservativesocial libertarianmoderate fully independent
she was never heard from again
regardless on your position on illegal immigration in the usa hitting an already hurt economy with a 16 billion dollar wall that will be ineffective is not a good idea also most people arent aware that the majority of illegal immigrants come from asia
well china built the great wallwhy cant the us have one
now im mexican i used to live in the uslegally so obviously a lot of the comments made by trump hit a little close to home the problem isnt a wall theres already a big fence security is high the problem is immigrants overstaying their tourist visas border security should be improved and increased but also immigration officers need not treat those crossing with such disdain the us has every right to protect its borders to whatever extent it desires the only problem i see is a better attitude towards people
there should be a cash award for getting illegals deported if there isnt one already
i think that guy has been using some of those drugs coming across
lmao to the face you made at the end dude was all over the place with this topic i can agree on a wall but i believe the system is flawed to get a citizenship that takes alot of time and money to make happen if a wall is to be built at least work on the process for citizenship
the cia bring in the drugs trump blames mexicans for smuggling drugs but the cia has always been open with the cartel since the 80s dont believe me its actually documented and many cia workers were either arrested or just killed mexican makes the drugs but us americans love it
this honestly wasted my time  cause that idiot was talking the whole time about a fairly tail
have you ever changed your mind on change your mind peterson spoke with jefferies and jefferies managed to changed his mind with one strong argument im not sure if you are actively trying to learn or if you are pushing your agenda on your channel ive watched a bunch of these and have yet to see you waiver on a topic
ive said a million times my teeny tiny austrian grandma came to america on a boat alone through ellis island learned english worked hard refused government hand outs became a citizen sponsored her mother sister   brother all whom did the same also my fathers grandparents came here on a boat from sicily through ellis island learned english worked hard never took governmemt assistance became citizens the story is old my ancestors had no money  they were called wops micks krauts guineas etc so why should illegals have my support they dont even have my respect i detest what they symbolize dont tell me we are all immigrants i only stand with legal immigration
that spanish dude seems like hes flying high in the sky on something
the second participant just makes shit up as the talk goes on no substance and just running their mouth for the sake of running their mouth and these people usually the loudest
1317 what the fuck just happened lol
that guy is into some hardcore utopic scifi shit
i had a discussion with someone about illegal immigration and they used the point that america has ruined other countries through war and just because they wanted to and that why cant blame people for coming to our country illegally i wasnt sure how to reply to that other than saying theyre welcome but legally any advice anyone
people are still going to get in the country either way so why waste peoples tax money does he have a video on the prison system cause tax money is wasted there
is steven a trump supporter or anything 
i dont understand how you can defend a physical wall to be the final solution to illegal immigration america has very long coasts boats is a thing just look at europe also the thing about immigrants beeing more prone to going into illegal occupations is more so about them living outisde of the system there cant be a whole lot of options for someone whos forced to live outside the system right hard to imagine a wall solving any major problems of any kind in the long run
very strange sound he makes it the end of some of his words uh anyone else notice uh
a wal would disturb the ecosystem in that envoirement and it would nature in smaler paches this could mean more insest in nature and less comunication in nature
i was under the impression that most of drugs were brought in by either air or sea and of the percentage that is brought in by land how much of it is actually brought over the border outside of the border stations and tunnels
that spanish dude is ignorant as fuck like 5 to 10 years there wont be any borders and travel will be cheap and efficient lol ive never heard such a great joke in my 28 years of life that dude made me cringe super hard as well
i agree with a new reform but the wall will add more debt to the us in reality i believe the wall and reform wont work and will waste on a lot of money it wont work
people come seeking asylum which is there right
so basically we should not build a wall because it will be harder for other to smuggle in and suck all the milk from america
the way you looked at the camera
ye i agree for the wall but america needs to be able to pay not mexico
the wall is a waste of time and money people will dig holes under or break it and immigrants do most of work in america i just wonder a us without immigrants pretty bad the americans would be jumping the border to the other side instead 
i do agree with legal immigration butwalls have shown historically to not work and would be a huge waste of money
this is the only video that i dont agree with
what if we promise to build a wall with a revolving door which only works with legal documents
first of all he says hes spanish but not mexican cause his family has been in new mexico since the 1550s wtf new mexico was mexico in the 1550s secondly he is all for an xray border that will tag people and track them yeah that sounds extremely expensive and i dont think our technology is that advanced jesus christ this guy is an idiot also in the future he wants to be the governor in new mexico smh am sorry but we truly have some stupid people that have no business talking politics cause they dont even know their own history lol
build the wall want in do it legally
the mexican with a white t shirt is so fukin dumb
build the wall please
leeroy will most likely get the vote for governor lmao
fans of steven understand why he sits the way he sits speaks the way he speaks and gestures the way he gestures all this is done because hes been professionally trained to assert dominance in a  conversation and thus instilling a sense of im wrong what should i do paniclike behavior from his debating opponents
im not mexican you know my family been down there since like the 1500s at 520 really heart my brain
tf she saying
if that guy runs for governor of new mexico ill move and change my state of residency to vote for the other candidate ho ly shit
1055 scientificle  xd
the problem here is that they are discussing immigration and not the wall itself
man that second interviewee was almost completely unintelligible his logic was so offkilter im starting to think a comprehension and debate test should be mandatory for people who desire citizenship how can we even hope to have an informed and educated voter base with people like that
build the wall
i live near the border at least in this area in calexico california they are adding or upgrading a point of entry they are adding a fence not a wall i wonder if this is what is going to be across the border and not a wallits a lot nicer than the sheet metal fence they had before at that location also tunnels are always being found 
theyre just gonna find a way around it what a fucking waste of money
what surprised me the most is how ignorant and naive college people are and how indoctrinated with bs they are
seeing as how you yourself have become a citizen legally why not mention how long it takes and how much money is actually required  to do so i moved to the stats when i was 14 but since my mother was american it was relatively easy to change citizenships my father on the other hand it took him 6ish years and above 10k something people seem to leave out quiet often imo
how do you keep them from walking around the checkpoint well it would be an xray 
i wish i could talk to this man i could easily change his mind granted hes nowhere near me
just shoot the illegal invaders its cheaper than a wall
building a wall whould do morris bad than good for the us
what is she saying
this is totally unfair the way people are making hispanics look is horrendous have you ever seen a mexican asking for money on the streets no are mexicans killing people in the us no we come here and work fucking hard we pay for our taxes half of the white people in this country dont lets not forget how this country became the usa europeans came and killed the natives who lived in the country before them columbus didnt find the new world if i had already been found by native americans firstand another thing stop saying america is yours when its not do you own south america too theres bigger problems in the world hispanics cant do anything wrong in this country or else theyll get deported we are in the hiding
enforcing the mexican border is a good thing to do and that ensures that most immigrants dont cross illegally sure theres a small  percentage of people crossing over but thats still a large number and think about this if we were to build a wall think about how it will effect the economy sure people might be well paid for building a wall but also think about the amount of resources that is needed the amount of food and water people need the right materials needed to build and think about this most of our resources comes from china most resources coming from china and the amount of money needed to build the wall would probably be costly
leroy is insane
hi steven i wish id have a chance to try to change your mind i would enjoy a civil discussion with you i believe there should definitely be some kind of immigration reform i think that while the wall sounds logical it could cause more problems than it would fix namely its extraordinarily expensive we have border fenceswalls in place already that are a deterrent and the actual physical border doesnt match property lines so a wall would go through american citizens property im not sure what the best solution is but asking an ally to fund a wall after making some racist remarks theyre bringing drugs theyre rapists about them i feel is what made this discussion so controversial and why people are harassing you not that i condone it i think if we really want to deter illegal immigrants then we have to crack down on employers hiring illegal immigrants for extremely low wages that might be more expensive for american citizens but so is building this wall and we can either have people here legally or we have to accept illegal people here if we want low wage labor
building the wall is the biggest waste of money we should just reform the system with just passport requirement if an immigrant breaks laws deport or charge serve time then deport come in without passport deport
while i do understand why some believe building a wall is the right thing but the cost would be astronomical the us would have to pay for the material workforce security etc but also since the wall would be build in the wilderness youd have to build roads too and even before building it the us would have to make sure it lives up to any laws concerning nature and if it is built then there is maintenance and staff costs tooa wall might make a difference but is it affordablei understand why they want a wall go for it im not american so i couldnt possibly understand the issues 100 but i find it very interesting that there are such an amount of illegal immigrants in the us i highly doubt that would happen in the uk or denmark or germany
im shocked by how unbelievably stupid that spanish guy is holy fuck he wants to be governor of new mexico one day how can people be this confident and dumb
obviously youre going to win debates if you talk to people that clearly have no idea how to even put their thoughts across the idea of building a wall is still stupid as fuck and is only supported by delusional trump fans plenty of countries in the world exist where migration isnt a serious problem and guess what none of them have giant walls oh well i guess the priorities with tax money are already fucked in the us worlds biggest military budget and you have people dying because they cant afford to call an ambulance lmao
please dont tell me you are supporting the wall idea
hhmmm instead of a physical wall leroy wants to have a demilitarized zone between mexico and usa where life is hostile and after your body gets vaporized by the perpetual xrays your identity is established leroy wants a laser fence
anyway even if they increase security immigrants are going to find a way to enter i think
alot of the illegals that come are hsrd working but they also work the system as in terms of welfare most are marked as single income families yet have a spouse the amount of money they put into taxes isnt even close to covering the amount that americans spend on taking care of them america also gives aid money annually to many countries many of those countries are the ones these people are leaving having more illegals is not good for americas economy
that last guy my god crowders face at the end speaks it all i honestly lost it when it zoomed in because ive never seen a more honest reaction to a chaotic stupid alignment character
well i mean i have nothing against better border protection but just building a wall is hella impractical not my problem if it happens cause im dutch but i think that enhancing the legal pathway to citizenship is a good alternative and a zero tolerance policy with illegal immigrants but in a civil and respectful way shouldnt be a problem for me and i think for the rest of europethe world maybe a more symbolic wall is better in my opinion
me being born from parents that are illegal immigrants i hate the fact of the wall but i can understand the fact of the wall but i like the end result limiting or cutting the amount of people in america if we have more people in the country that leads to poverty to the country also i hate it because the mindset of most people that support the wall thinking that all immigrants are drug dealers and rapist when that is totally wrong i have aunts and uncles that are illegal immigrants that have never done illegal drug or have never done something as bad as theft and murder  they have got parking tickets or speeding tickets is what i mean by someone bad they are all hard working people
the lady was very respectful and she was very nice
deport the illegals
the border between mexico and us isnt the only border so why hate on mexicanos if we are hard workers and drug dealers and scum are in every race besides there is a wall up already and that is not stopping those that over stay visas or cross illegally from the northern border spend that money on helping the war vets or make sure children dont go without food or education secure all borders so dont spend money on your over priced wall and spend it on personnel
build the xray gate for the future governor of new mexico
did any of them talk about supply and demand cuz thats what one of the big problems with the wall is does it really prevent people from getting across did prohibition stop alcohol use   the war on drugs is a failure for the same reasons if you dont cut the demand there will always be some way to get the supply be it tunnels ladders or boats
ya build that wall and pick those avocados and fresh produce white boys hahahahhhaha i think a metaphorical wall would be more feasible than rather a real wall to be built just to keep all the racists calm it would cost too much money it would take too much time a lot of land this supposed wall would be built on is private land and at the end of the day mexicans are as ingenuitive as rednecks so soon enough theyll find a way around the wall that wall would be useless in other news an honduran man was arrested in his house the police found 34 stolen jobs in his garage
omg the end killed me xd
xray border this dude is high af on something lmao
even if youre for the spirit of the wall is it really practical is it going to be an impenetrable wall that spans the entire border that people cant climb over tunnel under or otherwise get through i guess i could be for it if its not just a statement about illegal immigration that wastes billions of dollars
you can still build the wall wont stop illegal immigration america can have a fucking force field robots with miniguns attached to them and still illegal immigrants will still come through give illegal immigrants props in actually crossing the border that shit looks tough and hard to do walking non stop in the desert hiding from border patrol and still make it through clap clap clap
the 2nd dude was definately using meth
build the fkin wall already why cant the us protect it boarders why do latinos get so butt hurt work hard like us indians and stop crying
that guy just said he wanted to tag and bag all mexicans so when they pass the x ray wall we can charge them for it
well the wall doesnt just stop the illegal immigrants all together theres underground tunnels that a lot of them come in from i feel like the wall is better just for creating multiple different sorts of jobs sure it will stop some people from coming in illegally but not all it could very well just end up being a big waste of money
this man said idk the scientifically used word but some type of xray thing
so a mark of the beast xray scanner  thatll stop the illegals from coming inoh wait no it will make it okay for everyone to come in illegally only it wont be illegal  because the problem of course isnt that so many illegals are coming in its just that some of them may not pay taxes  so as long as they pay taxes thatll get rid of all of the disproportionate crime committed by illegalsso what the guy is actually saying is that he wants total and complete open borders with no restrictions  rapists drug dealers sex traffickers ms13 criminals of every sort  theyre all okay its only those wouldbe tax evaders we should be worried about  boy thats some really sound leftist logic
you can build the wall but people are still going to come i really dont care if they do im already here lmfao the wall is never going to get built just saying
what an interesting conversation that guy has some interesting ideas
you couldve gotten shot up by a mexican gang
can we all just agree on that last guyits absolutely terrifying to think that the government can track your whereabouts that closely i am angry enough the track how and where i spend and make money through my ssn i do not need a police state that can track me down to which room in my house im in
govenor of new mexico i hope hes going to gain about 40 iq points by then
my brain turned off at about four minutes wut
taxation is theft
honestly i think building a literal wall is a terrible idea because you have to realize that much of the border is in very remote areas and the money and infrastructure required to build it would be astronomical and that money would be much better off being spent on other things such as road maint building newer non fossil fuel power stationsplease someone make a liquid fluoride thorium reactor power station and etcinstead of the wall support fund encourage local areas to start up volunteer based border patrols pay local people watch their area of the border with the commonality of drones they can see so much more than a person on the ground so some combination of that would be far more cost effective then a wall
i like these not because of all the standpoints but just to show you people will have an opposite stance but have no way to counteract it they just know it may not be the most optimal solutionsuggestion personally i dont think a wall should be built
what about wild animals though animal habitats are already fragmented by roads and buildings are you going to issue them passports too increases in temperatures have led to shifts to higher latitudes in many animals as they move to escape the heat what will they do once they reach the wall
one day i plan on being the governor of new mexico
wow clueless
even though white kids shoot up their schools
steves wrong 100 percent of the illegal immigrants are causing a crime
the guy he was talking too was literally just talking to talk he had no real views and was just making stuff up on the spot
sounds a lot like 1984 humm  an xray machine lol
thanks for the sunday belly laugh it never gets old ever
sounds like this guy brought some drugs with him to the interview lol
these people are idiots
i have drank steven crowders cool aid and i like it
oh my god the stupidity force is strong in this one
drugsuh
an x ray gate  haha
can i get the source for the murders the illegal immigrants  stands for
jeffs the real winner cuz hes in canada with the prostitutes and didnt kiss their ass good you sticking their asses to court you know
yes its true me and jeffrey had a bisexual relationship a couple years back hes very good in bed but we dont talk because he likes prostitutes
too bad nicole and jeffs games than work she calls him every morning she does not like the orgies she cant get it up and shes not accepted
hello my name is james from twitter i got a lot of money large inheritance im generous selfish and greedy with my money at the same time im into selling drugs stocks and bonds and other things i love my money
im sorry but if you think we should build a wall you are a fucking idiot crowder is not intelligent and not an intellectual hes not stoic and hes none of the things you think he is he is a greedy conformist and a racist you are all his puppets hes a conformist altreich piece of shit wake the fuck up people you didnt wanna be brainwashed by the left because the right told you they would brainwash youmeanwhile they have successful done so with psychological tactics building a wall ia so dumb its not gonna happenit wontbesides that its immoral what kind of nazi would support it i officially hate america when i used to be a patriot the right consists of greedy pig conformist stiffs and ignorant brainwashed red necks who only vote for the stiffs because they too are racist and full of hate well i hate you
building the wall will not solve the problem or help relations between the 2 countries it just sends out the wrong message  i believe that trying to work together is a better option to solve problems the joke here is that every single american is an immigrant or has an immigrant background apart from the natives america has invaded so many foreign countries since the 80s and destroyed them yet they want to build a wall to keep immigrants out white men go on mass shooting sprees yet i dont see the government trying to stop white men coming to america trump made racists comments about mexicans thats a fact hes right about boarders as the eu has an open boarder policy however that has not worked as it only helps criminals as you have seen in europe with islamic terrorists having a physical border will wont by needed in the future as the uk and ireland are working on that right now so the spanish guy is on the right track however i am not sure how this will work but it will happen
that second guy lol hes like enforce that you know wheres these people are register them tax them how they fuck do you do that without a wall
building a wall will make the economy crash again i personally feel its stupid to do so bush crashed the economy with his wall i live 10 miles from it and its not going to stop illegal immigration it wont stop anything because there will still be corrupt ports where people can come threw corrupt airlines and etc the wall will be a big waste of money and will honestly do no difference just like the wall bush built or have we forgot we prices sky rocketed on everything and the job losses and debt that we were in
since the fifteen fifties 1550  oo
come on down just not illigally
dude at around 6 minutes in is 100 on coke
it doesnt really do any good blurring her face if her id is in plain site
i believe in building a wall but if america wants mexicans aka spaniard and native american descendants and south american natives to stop coming to america then american companies should stop paying them such as fast food chains agricultural industrial and environmental its simple but americans want cheap and will exploit the closest resource to fill theyre greed build a wall mexicans will build it because it will be subcontracted out to a american company who gives the poor exploited labors fake social security numbers america feeds off the desperate look at your clothes see where theyre made some poor person who gets paid 10 cents a hour made them theyres out breaks of salmonella on lettuce because 40 south american native immigrants share one portable john with no place to wash theyre hands except in the water that feeds your salad and wipe theyre asses with the lettuce leaves you eat
i know trump said mexicans are rapist and criminals but steve to support his argument factually said they arent brining in the drugs but you know what the dude meant by that he means crime and im sure many people think mexicans are bringing in drugs
build a wall with your ass is going to be my senior quote for sure
haha what a moronic commentargument and talkative without substance although fun to watch him talk
the wall concerns are like berlin is it to keep people out or is in
i hate how this is a topic at all how stupid do you havw to be to actually believe this has a racial variable or something its the law it a law thats being broken and un respected and its an issue that would be nice to crack down on with the percentages of crime that illegal immigrants bring let alone being illegal is high enough we can agree if bordal patrol is tighter and enforced crime rates will obviously go down even if they were low percentages i mean if you have a rapist in your apartment complex youd want him gone
less drugs for america if that wall gets built
he said his family has lived in new mexico since the 1550s 
holy christ that last guy is an absolute moron
the first lady seemed to have good intentions with her family in mind
the irs used to refer to what she is asking as dropping a dime on someone a telephone call anonymously from a payphone used to cost a dime if they are moneylaunderingloansharking  they sure as hell are invading the income taxes ice under trump may take note of her complaints sure but she can alert more people than ice irsfbi cia almost anybody above the local cops  nothing against them but they would probably be the most timid to take such allegations seriously
of course you should be against illegal immigration its illegal
americans and their wall bless  ladders were invented years ago
i swear to god steven gets regularly owned with logic and facts in these videos but hes too smug and concerned with bein right to admit it steven made change my mind to profit off of shockvalue politics and proves who he is as a person because his intention is absolutely never to have his mind changed note how in all these videos that whenever he gets backed into a corner with facts he just makes shit up or tries to throw the other person off by bringing up a totally different controversial topic heres a video with some other reasons why steven is an idiothttpsyoutubeko5owh1fxe
undocumented workers already pay taxes to stay here and they dont get anything back
the cartels already tax the illegals lol
mexicans make their money in the us and send back most that money back to mexico  while using us services  resources
his face at the end lmao
whats the ratio of illegal immigrants entering the country by foot vs by plane id imagine there are far more people coming by plane can anybody provide numbers on that
i dont know much about the immigration process but we should make them all citizensthis is why i hate having a discussion with anybody on the left just do some damn research if you want tell people what to think
yeah lets have open borders with no wall and then in ten years complain about 30 billion people who moved in from other countries chaos
wow the guy wants to be a governor but cant put his thoughts into a sentence and when he does its a stupid idea 
i dont like the interviewer he is not highly articulate if you say that any one that arrives at united states border should be given citizenship immediately i bet you that more than 3 billion people will arrive in the united states within a year and that nation will be completely destroyed do all this morons know what open border will result to why cant these people take in 20 immigrants each into their homes and let see how it goes
id rather take the money wed spend on a physical wall and form a wall of men and technology hire more border patrol agents tracking drones to locate illegals crossing and increase our amount of ice agents and or authorizefund more local police operations to crack down on the illegals already here this would provide jobs and take care of illegals already in the nation far more than a physical wall would do a physical wall can be dug under climbed  or flown over i dont buy for a second that the trump wall cant be climbed  and with the popularity of drones that can support the weight of multiple humans  smugglers no longer need planes or helicopters or even pilots to transport people or large amount of drugs over the border dont get me  wrong a physical wall sounds really cool im just not sure how effective it would be in todays world
did yall know that christopher columbus spoke and wrote in spanish if he was supposedly the founder of america why do stupid white racist pieces of shit hate people who speak spanish in america
the wall isnt going to stop illegal immigration so america would spend billions of dollars and it wouldnt change a thing the wall is just an idea of a saver america nothing more to make people think america is more save with a wall
yoooo watch the end of this clip and see how this crowder creep cuts this nervous kid off when he starts finally making so gd sense creepy af crowder  schill
where does this dude get all his statistics lol every time smfh
i want statistics on the 3 committing 30 of the crimes  i dont believe it otherwise
you know  steven  i may or may not disagree with you and ill bet i can get you onto my bandwagon i dont want the wall because it wont primarily solve the immigration problem  secondly  when it comes to immigration  we should be focusing less on how wrong it is for them to be here and more on why theyre here the fact is simple  the immigration laws that we currently have in place are far too strict  and innocent people are suffering in mexico because of it  people cross the border illegally because theyre desperate  and i think that that is cause for a reform
no wall is needed yes there should be good border protection for those people who should not come in but we must not assume that all people attempting to come in illegally should not be here because they broke our law if people are in need of help why not make it easier for them to recieve it rather then punish them for a crime we unintentionally forced them to commit especially when our country has enough resource to provide  the help in the past laws had to be broken in order for our country and society to realize that change was needed this might just be one of those times
all this guy does is go around  instigating drama with people who he disagrees with he seems like a smart person but then again he also supports trump which makes no sense at all
thats easy adam already ruined the wall for us
im not mexican im spanish dumb mf
idk i agree with the fact that we need to keep the bad people out but from personal experiences hispanics that come here illegally work hard and do all the dirty jobs that no one else that comes here are willing to do
what the heck did i just watch  this guy lives in a delusion he must think star wars is history
i love the people that come and try to argue with anecdotal and weak arguments and just shit their pants with your stats and vast knowledge
dude interviewed is an idiot
potential governor of new mexico ladies and gentlemen
but why stick to the idea of a wall sure reinforce immigration but do it internally without spending billions of dollars on a physical border whether that means xrays or microchips or whatever the hell people come up with thats such a waste of money and people will always find a way to get through always you people basically want to build a physical border that people will find their way around within a couple of weeks or months
i see what you did there its pretty fucked up js
how much people have been killed by american weapons 700lets get things straight building bridges instead of walls and support the education system with the bloody money instead of spending it for some wires might be better for economy people in western culture have pretty much enough to live a good life at least a good opportunity to get there with some effort so lets dont act to harsh when it comes to money and fear of loosing something we didnt earn and i hope we can all agree that our future goal should be to make this world a better place for us all and stick together  lets take your data most immigrants are male young adults  so the biggest group of people committing crime i dont need to tell what happens to young adults with no perspective immigration or job i think there is so much potential in good education for man who want something out of life and so less value in keeping them away
build the xray wall  change my mind
that lady asking who to report the criminals  seems like she is playing a fool
spanish kid is fuckin high
itd be pretty cool if you did this again with someone of a higher uhmmmm intelligence or have a spanish speaking translator
i dont want them to build a wall the wall hurts my feelings but they could like make a scifi xray wall across the whole border so it reads an electornic chip you put under all mexicans skin
x r a y s c a n n e r
im not mexican with his english like that hes obviously a 1st or 2nd generation immigrant people nowadays are ashamed to say theyre mexicans smh 
im spanish  my family moved to mexico 450 years ago  bright fucker the next gov of new mexico  you know like experts and that and 
you can walk across the rio grande i just watched a video where a guy brought two people across the rio grande and walked back 100 ft away from a bridge that leads in the mexico the only solution to this is something to stop them
what the hell is he talking about gonna be a mayor maybe a democrat mayor by the way he talks
xray wall 
i think the wall would be impossible to actually build it would be far too expensive
no wall but xray wall please do a sequel
like an xray scanner yeah like one day i plan on being the governor of mexico i need to sit down with like some computer engineers and really talk this out people have the iq of a poptart
these people act like the wall isnt going to have a gate aha
john oliver did a great segment on how many problems this wall would cause to this country i recommend it to everyone who believes this stupid wall would do any good
why dont we build a wall with canada because theyre country is fine and theres no threat there people can raise their families mexico not so much their is reason why people wana come here
yo do what you want but idk why you think the wall will stop anyone and about deporting people thats more difficult not everyone should be deported and i read the majority of illegal immigrants didnt break the law for obvious reasons and i thought it was good for the economy to have some illegal imigration fuck it lets just bomb everything and restart i gave up already shitty ass time to be in but i guess anytime in history is a shitty time eh fuck it i dont keep up with anything just hear uh to be honest both sides annoy me i wanna just yell shut up and make a decision you know like i gotta hear some shit and i dont even care like go away anyway i forgot what i even said already its morning for i dont know
the wall has been proven not to work its a waste of money
leroy is barely able to speak sentences
what a space cadet
lol that guy isnt representing his fellow mexicans in a good way
straight off the bat six seconds in      is it not fair to say that if you are against the wall you are simply pro illegal immigration immigration policy is a separate issue in my opinion all the wall would theoretically do is enforce the immigration policy are those against the wall saying we should collect our bags at the airport and just walk on in because thats the same idea isnt it a wall cannot be racist an immigration policy might be but a wall is just a wall if you dont like walls      go and sleep rough for a month and see what happens
i like your videos a lot but i am wondering one thing that i am surprised no one has ever asked you on these videos what would it take your change your mind
trump did claim mexicans bring in drugs  httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjaz1j0scl4
i dont agree with you on the topic but these people who argued with you were stupid d i understood your point but violence cannot be always the answer just like your pro guns video d protection is an important things but giving anyone weapon is not the answer
you need  to let in immigrants us british cannot take anymore
somewhat productive
make them pass the test man i dont think you have fully thought everything through and no sweet special mind please dont run for govern man what you described is what we have in place actually what you described is airport security mixed with sci fi movies but you just havent thought anything through and if you get others to do the work then what good are you sorry man but you just arent educated enough
so why are people building walls and fences around their houses those bastard racist
the second guy is as dumb as hell he has been smoking some kinda really poor quality weed
i feel like a physical wall would be a waste of time and money but a metaphorical wall would be genius what do immigrants come to the us for easy a better life so when they get here and start becoming educated they get free school aid from the government some type of health insurance the list goes on now if we take that away there would be no reason to come here other than to escape violencedrugs but they can simply move to another state in mexico but i say take away the privilegesways we spoil immigrants to get a fresh start and you will see the number of immigrants coming illegally decrease
good to see  how fucking useless this video was  using the most retarded people in a video   and just look at his military special ops bodyguards  im canadian so i cant possibly be a spook for the establishment playing my controlled opposition role and very well i might add  the world is a vampire people
i watched this and i personally am pro border control but against building the wall the wall is gonna work to a small extent but not very much there is a statistic and i dont remember the exact numbers but according to the statistic a majority of illegal immigrants come her legally with a work visa but then it expires and they stay in america or they come by plane which would fly right over the wall rendering it useless the wall would work a bit but it would be super expensive and not worth the cost i dont know how to completely fix this issue but a cheaper solution i feel would be to make it easier to became a legal citizen of the united states as of right now it can take years to decades to become a legal citizen which cost a lot in legal fees and expenses if they made a way that cost little to none and takes no more than a few months to a year to complete we will have a big decrease in illegal immigrants without spending lots of us tax dollars on a wall
you want the wall build it yourself with your money man itll make work for people hell as a dude with a mexican family id go weld that shit lol you pay me son but dont get surprised when people start turning their back on us
but the real question  here is why does the first lady has a tree in her drink
tax them  spoken like a true democrat
im for the xray boarder not because its logical its just so dumb its hilarious
this such word soup these people were confusing
like if your pump does 9 damage
im new mexican not mexican wat the hell y do drunk people try to argue with this guy
those were two of the dumbest people you couldve possibly interviewed you should just ask people from a debate team to sit with you theyd be more polite and bring up good discussion points
ive been a fan of crowder at times and a huge critic of crowder at timesthiswas excellent this might be the most professional i have ever seen crowder be no condescending attitude no high pitched emotion driven frustrated rebuttalscalm cool collected and factual more of this steven crowder pleaseeeeee
building that wall is a waste of time and money
1100 buddy pretty much described a boarder idiot
builing a wall to secure the border would be waaaay too expensive to build
i think the statistics might be wrong i just dont find reasonable that such a small number of ilegal immigrants contribute to almost one third of all homicides in the us it would be a nonstop murder spree from a few individuals who have to kill more than 2 people a year i dont think the numbers add up
an xray wall
if that guy ever becomes governor someone please shoot me
no borders no country period
lmao what a dumbass
you placated that dumb ass mexican dude for way too long without educating him i started skipping a head because it was boring the chit right out of me i understand when youre face to face it takes a certain amount of tact but jeesh  either smack them with facts or change the gimmick prime opportunities wasted with wanna be youtube dolts
build the great wall  of america   make it the second wonder of the world 
water like in the toilet
broo he plays with his life too much  he really bold to confront these issues and i respect him for that but he really taking a risk
this was a slow one and you didnt rebut very much
im confused i did public forum debate at catholic nationals for the sanctuary city topic i dont understand how illegal immigrants commit crimes at a disproportionate rate because its been debunked by multiple studies the cato institute a conservative organization reveals that cities with a higher illegal population have lower crime rates also the bureau of statistics cites that crime across the nation has went down but illegal immigration has went up to top it all of i believe brookings institute cites a study that says illegal immigrants lower crime by 33 i love your videos crowder but plz provide sources when you say stuff because if that was true then that would have been super helpful in my debates
build the wall with your ass bitch favorite part
334 shouldnt you blur her id card as well steven
if you are illegal there is no taxing you dont exist to the government dumb dumb
electronic id chip lol its not the hollocaust
im still confused on this issue and was really hoping you could find someone posing a lot of the questions i have then again these change my minds arent very constructive they are mostly an idiot arguing with someone whose well versed on the issue and is intelligent i guess theyre funny in the way of a person on a bicycle with a knife trying to fight an abrams tank but not really
 1109 it sounds almost as if he is talking about giving everyone a microchip implant to scan in order to gain entrance you would still need a wall with a gate to ensure no one would abuse or misuse  hmmm
build the wall haha its like performing cpr on a decapitated person its too late the damage has been done
whoever does not vote for him to be the governor of new mexico will be just as dumb as he is
i fucking hate her voice ahhh report her
1030 mark of the beast rfid chips
lmao that guy is not spanish
x ray border 
leroy was very scientifical lolwhat a moron
ahahfgdgg he said he wants to be the governor of new mexico nah im good luv enjoy
lol there isnt going to be a ridiculous wall
i think they are missing that the wall will have door passages for migrant to enter i think they are called border checkpoints 
good idea tax the people that dont have money d
x ray wall 
why arent you wearing pants
i generally cant  wouldnt argue against crowder but hes way wrong here most illegal immigration happens from people arriving on legal visas and overstaying the wall is an expensive and inefficient solution to a small piece of the puzzle it would literally do little to curb illegal immigration because planes
yeah tax them because they come here with pockets full of money
i dont think building a wall would be benificial for the amount of money it would cost
was the second guy able to find his way home  he probably still wandering around the streets mumbling about this
if you want to debate please have some common sense if not you make your opponent look way more superior
wall wont do much over 50 of illegal immigration is through air and they overstay their trip
yeah lady they tried that its not working we need a wall no wall no country what is wrong with ppl
new mexico soon to become chernobyl 20
le troy trio is abit naive and too many sifi movies
if people are doing the wrong thing the solution to the problem is not to make the wrong thing legal people kill each other but the solution to that problem is not to make murder legal the liberal mentality of its going to happen anyway is not an acceptable excuse for allowing anarchy
welfare moneyfood stampsmedical costs us more than what we would ever tax if you dont have a social security number and work above the table then youre not paying any tax other than state sales tax for goods dumbass
lived in nm for years and statistics dont lie nm has some of the highest rates of rape and violent crimes in the nation and one of the highest rates of domestic violence that guy doesnt know sht
i love the second guys logic let undocumented amounts of immigrants in somehow tax them and to do so we must make them legal almost seems like a visa
wall street has committed more crimes than illegal immigrants
i would like to hear the actual reasons for the need of the wall its not just about immigration control allegedly it is to help keep out terrorists the tsa doesnt work how many terrorists were stopped by the tsa we cant afford the wall how do we pay for it cut social programs cut military spending what pays for it  walls dont just keep people out it keeps people in as well if its about keeping terrorists out  then we should build a wall along the canadian boarder some of the 911 terrorists came in from canada  not mexico
this dude is living in a scifi fantasy world
thats guys family has been here since the 1515 and you can still hear some accent in his speech
jesus that dude had neanderthal level brain power
this idiotic wall is trumps idea of a feel good solution to appease his basethis wall in  some places is a mountain a  river and occasionally just a fenceeven the billion  dollar part is just a  25 billion  dollar  wall that can be defeated by a 25  dollar ladder or a portable grinder40 odd of us illegal immigrants  fly into the ushowever the greatest joke of all with this piece of  snake oil  fuckery is the one that says mexico is going to pay for it allcrowders methology is  absurd too sit  down  with 2 people  with  the collective iq of a shoe and watch them make fools of themselves in order to prop up his own  agenda
omg that idiot guy made me laugh so hard
im a beaner but man i wish i couldve sat down and just talk with this guy maybe one of us can talk sense into each other im pretty chill and considerate if what hes got to say
blurred her face but not id card
dude i highly recommend you cut that part out with the mexican lady the cartel is dangerous and that lady living in an apartment with them puts her at high risk
the us governments been bringing drugs into the country for decades flooding poor communities with them and controlling the heroine business people are quick to talk about immigrants bringing drugs into the country but fail to mention how the government controls the drug trade the war on drugs is the war on competition statistics dont include the guys at the top who do far more harm for the country and the planet and who find ways around paying their taxes who commit fraud and theft on a massive scale wed do a lot better doing something about them than immigrants who are trying to make a better life for themselves
510 years
electronic chips are an even worse idea which weve seen coming for years but its most likely whats going to happen
poor leroy hes like lets make immigrants act like theres a wall but dont actually build one lol
i actually cannot comprehend how dumb the second guy is
pretty sure the second person is full of crap
wait according to crowder donald trump did not state that they are bringing crime drugs into the country
who ever said it would be a physical wall i mean i dont know maybe trump did but he might just mean stricter border control
x ray borders nice are americans that are against the wall mad that it would cost money or what what do they disagree with because we have a fence already it just doesnt work is it just the idea of a wall maybe we should call it something else a tall slab maybe a wall works ask china and the xray border is not free
that last guy has been watching to much futurama
that guy thought he was recording
i threw my cat over my fence like it was a gay mexican
fuck u man enough being racist
this guy man no how wilo you make them go to th xray gate
damn these people are fuckin retarded
the second guy made up a argument that a grade 7 would say
dont waste money on the wall just set up a giant floating xray along the border and that will make sure all illegal immigrants get cancer straight away problem solved
china has done rather well with their wall in keeping the mongolians out just saying
no offense but the wall would be very expensive
im not mexican im spanish shut the fuck up wetback
no donald trumps position on illegal immigration is that they are bringing in drugs that they are rapists murderers and in general criminals when in actuality most mexican which for some reason trump thinks are the only illegal immigration are hard working people that want a better life and or are escaping dangerous situations in their own home countries
i could watch a 10 hour video of change my mind
the second person is so delusional
422 the precognition is strong in crowder cool that the guy was willing to talk although the facts werent on the side of his ideas maybe they were off the top of his head or maybe he had researched these issues for his prospective future of holding political office i hope he learns better how to research before he potentially wins and actually does become governor lol i have a bit of respect the guy though his ideas are clearly not malevolent or evil as wildly wrong and harmful as they would be if implemented maybe his hearts in the right place but good intentions can have tragic dire consequences
he actually had some good thoughts
this second dude is so dumb its crazy he is proably illegal himselve
nanomachine is the way of the future like metal gear solid 4
as a mexican you can build all the walls you want but dont try to subjugate one of your strongest commercial allies into paying for something as useless as a wall
what an idiot that guy is talkin about no walls and xray borders he been smokin too much crack me thinks
glocks are much better
lol please the government makes enough money off taxes we dont need more money from people so that argument is retarded
no better way to go green than with an xray border lmao
yeah new mexico is going to be fucked if he is the governor
lmfao is this guy serious
i wont claim to know if a wall is the answer or not but i 100 believe in strong border security   ronald reagan  a nationthat cannot control itsborders is nota nation
im running for governor dude no
lolol the dumbest mf ive ever seen on this page is the same guy who aspires to be the governor of new mexico smh
where did he get his statistics im just curious
so is the guy in the white tshirt impaired or does he not understand the difference in the terms legal vs illegal
this one isnt very good the problems with the wall arent the reasons these idiots on the street listed if the wall is built it costs a ridiculous amount of money for something that doesnt even solve the problem on its own  people will still get in and  because its a 1000 mile stretch of concrete infrastructure the upkeep will cost an increasing cost in millions as time goes on along with the cost of surveillance that trump also planned to give to this 1000 mile concrete wall with armed guards also according to the department of homeland security 70 of illegal immigrants come through on worktemporary visas and simply dont leave most illegal immigrants arent the border hopping stereotypes that you would assumehell trump himself said that someone could get over it with a rope and ladder the very first time he brought it up at one of his ralliesthe problem people should have with the wall isnt some sort of political correctness stance its the fact that from an economic standpoint it doesnt solve the problem proportionately to the cost of building and maintaining it also what was that second freeborders guy even talking about lmao
i think its hilarious that the new mexican guy says his familys been here since the 1550s but he has a heavy mexican accent
did that mexican lady drink the mexican water
how are we about to get around super fast and super cheep lmao and in 5 or 10 years hes high
you formally smoke everyones boots steven crowder 
jesus is not real change my mind
leroy what youve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard at no point in your rambling incoherent argument were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul
shes illegal and report illegals ok
love the shirt steven
mastermind individuals future governor of new mexico this guys ambitious but a bullshitter in training
damn the second guy looks stupid as hell im not talking about what he says but his facial expressions and nonverbal yells fucking idiot
im for a reform against illegal immigration but a physical wall is completely irrelevant lol
please interview educated individuals
steve youre just simply wrong about the wall i would of changed your mind
if mexicans are so hard working why cant they make mexico a great place to live instead of flooding the us for a better life you cant just get rid of borders and have everyone move into one place
when you learn and understand that the left thrives purely on emotionyou learn everything you need to know about their party
i say dont build the wall fro the simple fact its waste of money greatest tunnel diggers to ever walk this earth you can build a fucking game of thrones wall and it wouldnt stop shit
the wall will never be built i hope you retards understand that
holy moly can you guys start checking iqs of interviewees
the wall is an incredibly stupid idea from the economic diplomatic and practicality standpoints that being said i am for securing our borders but using a different tactic from an economic standpoint the wall is a massive expense not only is it estimated over 25 billion to produce but maintenance would be a nightmare furthermore the wall acts as a symbol whether we like it or not it could cause heavy diplomatic tensions not only with mexico but with other countries who witness our country undertaking such a massive project simply to block out another country even with checkpoints and gates walls are never a good diplomatic solution finally the wall will not be effective majority of illegal immigrants actually make it over by plane and simply overstay their visas the illegals that do cross the border are innovative and organized a simple standing structure will not stop them i feel as though a better option would be to outsmart their ingenuity and use technology to secure our borders in a more efficient and effective way this can be done in many ways the hardest part about securing the border is actually being able to know when someone has crossed over illegally this is obviously a serious technical challenge for our engineers in densely populated areas along the border this can be especially tricky a wall may be more effective in these areas but it is common practice for illegals to dig tunnels under the border anyway these are extremely hard to detect and often lead to buildings in the us making them even harder to find the most effective way to deal with illegal immigration would most likely have to come from reforming our documentation standards while the us keeps good records ids and documentation can still be easily faked furthermore a more effective documentation system can prevent illegals from taking advantage of our social benefits such as free healthcare food stamps unemployment etc if we simply upgraded our systems to be more difficult to fool and increased funding for border patrol we could be much more effective in deportation of illegals this problem lies in our cultural values as well with the left using proillegal immigration rhetoric our community has become more ignorant of the damage that illegals cause on a day to day basis this means that a majority of our community will refuse to report illegals a well funded interest group with a well though out marketing campaign could help swing the misinformed population this is not so much a policy issue as it is a cultural one if our community could stand up against those who take advantage of our social benefits this issue could be heavily mitigated
idk i one day plan on being the governor of new mexico 
this guy is literally the white republican male that represents everything thats wrong with the people
iam mexican i belive they should bulid the wall because a lot of weapons and drugs do come throw i believe that imagrationts should be able to become legal easier or get a visa easier because i lived in mexico and mostly everyone who goes to america because they are poor and most cant afford to get a visa so when you make it easier i believe they are more willing to pass throw legally
shove the wall up your ass well i got to stretch this ass it will hurt
loved that look at the end pretty much summed up his opinion as a whole
i wish we could pay a certain amount of money to have a  plaque with your name on it placed on the wall that could help with a lot of the funding also offer to let people come work on it for free for a few days or something a lot of us would jump at the chance just to be part of history and say we did our part to keep people from wandering into our country unchecked
the gentleman in the white shirt is hyped up on like 3 monsters or red bulls guy has energy i wish i had on a side note i think hes totally wrong i foresee borders getting tighter amongst nations also i dont see a large portion of the population ever at any moment thinking im totally cool with the government tagging me and being able to track my movements at all times through some barcode tracking device at least with cell phones you can turn your phone off or change settings so that doesnt happen what this guy just suggested was like a tattoo of some kind or an implant under the skin mind boggling that anyone would consent to that id die before i let the government or anyone for that matter tell me i had to do that
half of immigration done to the us is because of expiered visas the wall is a waste of money and im sure as hell not paying
that dude would rather submit to some real big brother type shit than freedom to be and stay in your own home country i for one do not want the government tracking me so other people can cross borders terrible trade off
an xray scanner
lmao lmao lmao borders are going to be a thing of the past pretty soon people will travel real fast i dont think now but in the next 5 years  lmfao hahahahahahaha that spanish guy needs his own show
build your wall is your country but you pay for it
catus on both sides of the wall  half mile thick   
the spaniard is a complete fucking idiot he reminds me of the kid in choir that cant sing for shit but everyone around him doesnt have to balls enough to tell him hes horrible same thing applies here he sounds like hes spewing recycled shit hes heard probably around a dinner table and his mother and friends probably tell him all of his ideas are grand when they are actually trash someone needs to check this guy
why dont people fuck with illegals
isnt it just like crazy expensive like all the land mass that needs to be changed for the wall but i just remember it was super expensive like everything about the wall was kinda impractical
xray bordergovernor of new mexicoholy shit death cant come fast enough
arent most illegal immigrant from planes
as long as there are countries there will be borders hello stupid
lol a scanner
can the spanish dude just pick an accent hes literally switching to canadian and then spanish
0508  im spanish yeah lmao
your lucky you didnt get your ass beat steven
i would have said whats the statistic for illegals committing a crime100they are here illegally lolololol
why does she have a plant
an x ray border  
while i dont a agree with building a wall the guy in the white shirt is just too impractical wall or not people will find a way in and a small percentage will continue to avoid taxes
lol wtf was that guy talking about
hahahaha your face at the end i nearly died lol
drugsuh
there is no way to justify not having a barrier to completely prevent illegal immigration other than just saying  i do not care if illegals enter this country illegally you know  you cannot say that you care but you do not care
i hate spics
tax the people that we dont know that are coming in 
that dude with the white tshirt is on crackhe has no idea what he is talking about lol
how do i deport uh report those people lol shes trying to send them back
dont agree with the wall but leeroy has no clue what he is talking about
ok that dude is a straight retard he definitely a mastermind god please stop with the scientifical talk about the xray band reader could you imagine him as the governor
its a total disrespect for the millions that did it legally and waited to get citizenship i had family that did it legally and they went through the hardship to get into the us
as a mexican i understand why the wall might be necessary however the argument in favor of building the wall that i most hear is drug smuggling but i dont think that mexico is the only responsable in this problem this is followed by a really simple logic if the drug business is so profitable is because theres not just a provider but also a consumer the drugs that are produced and sowed in mexico are consumed by the usa so its a two side problem if you want to stop violence and drug trafficking then stop fucking buying drugs because this business relationship is also affecting mexico it makes carteles stronger and stronger increasing violence mostly in mexico plus it has been found that the guns that carteles use are made in usa  build the wall educate people so they stop buiying drugs and supporting narcotrafficking and regulate immigration policies because im sure theres also bad mexicans going into the united states but dont make it so hard for the hardworking educated people to go in
leeroy xray bordercrowder 
i cant find the source that says illegal aliens are responsible for 40 of the homicides every article that i read has them committing homicide at lower rates i now question the validity of crowder sources for all his videos
this is one of the few of your opinions that i disagree with and i wish different people were interviewed so it could really get to the root of the problem but instead it was a bunch of cliches btw this comment section is cancer
so blacks commit 51 of murders and illegal immigrants commit 30 yet whites are the majority population damn whites need to step their murder game up we looking soft as fuck right now
to be honest although yes having immigration laws is very important i dont think building a wall is going to help anything besides make people more pissed off and hate america im probably going to get a lot of hate because of this comment but thats just what i think
that dude doesnt know wtf hes talking about honestly it hurts my brain listening to him brain vomit at crowder with all that enthusiasm
he makes us look stupid
very scientifical
this guy is just an attention seeking whore having certian opinions doesnt make you special
his ideas may not be good leroy but his bad ideas may lead to good great ideas
dude they were all free thoughts your ignorance was shining brightly
how many of those illegals get paid in cash and hes just dumb and living in his own world
have you considered a change my mind segment on the topic of capitalism also on flat earth vs round earth i think those would be entertaining
i think that the wall wouldnt stop jack shit 40 of illegal immigrants come on planes and plenty more come legally with a temporary visa and just dont go back the wall wouldnt stop these people and if we build the wall more people will come by plane or find other ways to get over or under the wall like tunneling or climbing
lol
can u create a dialogue on change my mind on black lives matter
the wall was started in san diego under clinton in 1998 my father in law was in the national guard and he worked on it its only an issue because trump if hillary won and wanted the wall thatd be great
the claim that illegal immigrants commit crime at higher statistical rates than citizens has been disproven in both census data and in studies such as one done in texas  many reputable sources have refuted this claim  i would like to see where crowder got his numbers  httpwwwpolitifactcomcaliforniastatements2017aug03antoniovillaraigosamostlytrueundocumentedimmigrantslesslikelycohttpswwwnytimescominteractive20180330upshotcrimeimmigrationmythhtml
new series crowder challenge  crowder challenge remove your front door in protest of trumps wall document leftist results
low iq they come here and then tell us we need more of their people go away or we start a war
a lot of illegal immigrants enter through planes they overstay their holiday visa a wall isnt gonna fix that secure it another way
did this dude actually say he was planning on being the governor of new mexico lmfao leroy is out of his mindlmfao
xray border
kind of inappropriate to not completely blur out the lady  talking about criminals living below her
xrays gates and no borders free flowing i would have to talk to some computer engineers about this idk someday i plan on being the governor of new mexico  bro this shit had me dying laughing  this shit is comedy
that spanish guywtf
but dont most immigrants come from planes  theyll just fly over it
here i thought the people that got interviewed on universities where idiots but holy shit these people are another level of uneducated
this guy wants to help drug traffickers
s
against the wall  a large percentage of illegal aliens 40 approximately come to the us legally  their work visa expires and they stick around  eventually they sneak back over the boarder because theyre afraid of ice and dont want to explain at the boarder gates why theyve been here for 6 months illegallyfurther most immigrants who cross the the border in areas where its just sunbaked emptiness dont make it already  theyve got to walk lightly supplied across almost a hundred miles of sunscorched scrubland where theres no water and no food  and they have to pack light because of the terrain  people seriously die out there  our problem is they come mostly over boat and right through the checkpointslastly the wall will cost billions and mexico aint gonna pay for it like he claims
the 2nd one that the guy talked sounded dumb as fuck
please ask your subs to sign this petition  we need 100000 total sigs by july 13th to ask potus to redact the ig report and present it to the american people as it should behttpspetitionswhitehousegovpetitionunredacteddeclassificationdepartmentjusticeinspectorgeneralreportpublicviewing
great wall worked preventing outsiders from coming in the guy in the white is delusional trump viewed mexico as a high point of criminal activity coming to the states sure there are good people coming to the states trying to start a good life which there is a process to get legally i dont know the criteria or how it works trump has did more in a year then what obama has done in his 2 terms im positive he knows what hes doing even from a business man the wall im sure of would stop crime rate of illegals in the country buildthewall
xray wall going to be a lot more cancer
since the 1550s
the sheer amount of confusion from educated adults on this topic is remarkable
the wall will be a good first step toward solving the illegal immigrant and illegal drug problem facing the nation a good second step would be the immediate deportation of all illegal aliens hispanic african middle eastern asian and all others
ill get on board with this whole wall thing if you get trump to take and pass the citizenship test
hes tripping  the xray border that extends all the way across the border
that guy with the chanelleroywas very polite 
after watching this watch john oliver present a factual argument against the wall remember polarization of the media and people living in their own echo chambers are one of the biggest issues with todays division between parties give it a chance httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvu8dcyocuyithere are valid concerns that may just change your mind considering the people interviewed here obviously could not make a coherent argument just because they could not does not mean it does not exist  another side note a general pillar of conservatism is fiscal responsibility thats what i believe in this wall falls nowhere in conservative economic ideals if a democrat proposed it it would be seen as a colassal waste of government resources
my family has been in new mexico since the 1550s you stupid
build the wall  and implement stiffer laws on illegals who enter this country and break the laws
yo man like i dont like this wall holmes but like if we could maybe have like a bunch of the  xmen watching and like after you get by them you write on a paper why you are in the usa and then like when you leave you like maybe go and scan your retna and like say on the new note how happy you were in the states this guys a fucking retard
i dont really care what you guys are doing over there in america but as a german i have to say that our experiences with a wall arent that good xd
did i just hear someone against the wall basically say lets rf tag and track illegal immigrants like animals i can picture ice out there tackling them and putting an ear tag tracker on them
do something on monogamy
borders are a thing of the past u heard it here first
leeroy sums up 90 of fortnite players
what in the fuck is this guy talking about xray border to id how are we even gonna id them if theyre undocumented
those im spanish new mexicans are beyond retarded you see those idiots everywhere in albuquerque and santa fe
crowder somebody asked me where did you get the crime stats saying illegals create 37 of the murders
how do i report those people caught me off guard
got itso you want people monitored ok coolhow the hell do ya do that without a area they need to go through stupidbuild the damn wall you want you to be a us citizen work for it
build the xray build the xray
personally i think the wall makes no sense because of many reasons one of which is that it is too expensive yes i know trump said he is going to make the mexicans pay for it but lets not be selfish where is the money going to come from to pay for the wall that he wants to put up who is going to pay for it what effect will it have on an already suffering mexico dont you think that it will cost less to screen them and have them come over legally than to build a wall and man that wall 247 how deep do you plan to build this wall 1 mile deep because we all know about the tunnels from mexico to the usa i have 100 more questions of course but i will post them after i get a response to this one curious as to the answers i get for those questions i just asked
somebody have leroy trevejo from this video contact me  i would like to pay to have his dna as well as any of his family members dna  tested to discover his ancestry linescolonization of new mexico in the 16th centuryhttpnewmexicohistoryorgpeoplecolonizationofnewmexicointhe16thcentury
that last guy is a moron  governor  when you say shit like you know   leeeeeeerrrrrooooooooyyyyyyy
even inside the schengen zone in eu there are some countries   including germany who let in over one million imigrants in 2015  who reinstated some kind of a border control and the whole europe insists on protecting the external borders of the bloc against illegals italy started to reject humanitarian vessels that pick up immigrants from the sea after they leave lybia soi dont know for me its amazing to see this agenda in us against borders and americans who think no borders is the best solution to this problem i live in an easteuropean former communist country and i reject the idea of being monitored and checked where i am where i go what i say on the phone and all that but still at least some form of border control is needed because there are some bad people out there
the look on your face after talking with leroy kinda says it all 
deadass why cant we just have rows of barb wire and areas full of land mines if they want to come here illegally they got to work for it
so the white tshirt guy means illegal people should not be deported and will be considered as legal in future well fuck up usa when moron still exist
the krusty krab pizza is the pizza for you and me change my mind
the white shirt dude thinks hes smart but hes dumb af holy shit
because the wall keeps people in as well
i disagree on you while people create the most violent crimes as of 2018 
that kid is a fucking moron and thats why this country is in the state its in get off the aderall bro
ladder  rope  expensive wall the wall is a 15 century solution to a 21 century problem
xray borders really we might as well have super man sit at the border and use his xray vision
implant chips wow
1318 when you speak with a fucking retard for too long
i want to move to the united states of snowflakes too 
im sorry but i dont know why this guy is talking when he has no experience with immigration or know the struggle i wish i was on this show to have a talk with this man about this topic so i will state my opinion here the wall shouldnt be built because its a waste of money mexicans will always find a way to jump it no matter what  i think that the only people that should be deported is the illegal criminals not hard working immigrants
the guy with the white shirt is so stupid legalize everyone and imply an x ray border 
i prefer this series when youre in an university campus because youre surrounded by libtards
second guy claiming he was only spanish as in from actual spain okay dude anyway looks like a guy in the beginning stages of meth or abusing adderall too soon to show on his face and teeth and fresh enough into the habit to get the full effects without the accumulated tolerance of a long time user

that dude was a total idiot made the video unwatchable good try steven  build a wall crack down on visa overstays 40 of illegal immigration stop chain immigration and lottery system penalties to employers that hire illegals deport them whenever caught
a scientifical xray gate that reads your id lol
i welcome legal  though  legal  lives matter fellow earthlings
you ugly sad racists how awful of you you dont understand we are humans
 x ray border  this nigga in 3018
i need to sit down with a group of individuals for that one
this mexican aka spanish dude is a fucking idiot i speak on behalf of mexicans and we dont want this jack ass representing us leroy just lost his audience
did you ever get the impression that leroy was under the influence
i apologize for the hispanic individual he is completely delusional dont take him serious
hey steven im a mexican currently living in mexico my point of view and i hope i change your mind by telling you that i can agree with you that you should clearly enforce the border but the reason i personally think the wall shouldnt be built is because it is a symbol of hostile separation between to countries neighbors by the way that care for each other and help each other economically with that said the wall could create a line between to countries that care for each other and have the same principles in conclusion i think you shouldnt build a wall but instead enforce the police and security in and near the border lets build bridges not walls yours faithfully santiago
yeah clearly he the guy in the white tshirt means rfid chips in people which is pretty evil much more evil than a wall
god these people are stupid
a lot of peoples intentions are good and i respect it but people need to stop being biased and actually think for themselves its hard to watch sometimes lmao
xray machinesssss sounds like a very unnecessary expense the walls cheaper and safer
the interviewees were doa well have to see this one again to get some better footagedont throw away that banner just yet mr crowder and mugclub gang
theyre turning the frogs gaychange my mind
donald trump literally said mexicans the very first time thats the reason us mexicans hate him so dam much but then changed it to immigrants and everybody seems to forget how he first worded it and say no he didnt say that
send all the white people back to europe as well how about that
we need an ellis island of the mexican border
you are an asshole
but can we all agree build the wall with your ass is pretty funny
1030 damn i want what hes having thats clearly some strong shit i mean why shouldnt we tag all illegal immigrants like they did to the jews at auswitchz lol and then have them pass through a fucking x ray machine the size of the whole damn border lol
this man is living in 2130
i wish they still taught actual history in schools because that last dude just explained what the nazis did to the jews with branding them with id numbers that get checked everywhere they gohe just literally advocated for id numbers on everyone but they are so against boardersi just have no idea anymore i give up
wow im against a wall but these arguments were terrible
isnt there already a wall there tho
why build a wall when you can simply xray the fuck out of the immigrants no pregnant mexicans on his watch
this wall is based on the idea that it is possible to stop immigration for that to happen you would literally need to satellite track every single human on the planet and know there where abouts i think walls work for animals but humans are too intelligent trump needs to go back to his drawing board and think of a better idea this will be just as useless as all of there other attempts to stop immigration
youre retarded
all these videos do is show how many crazy people are out there
this is so painful to watch  build the wall
the walther   means please dont kick my ass
so how you can tax someone who illegally entered the country and committed crimes even worse he went back where he came fromis this kid knowing what hes talking about
completely pointless video
nobody ever will be able to stop immigration anywhere this is a natural phenomenon between states and other countries try as you might your not gonna stop it
idk how steven talked to the guy in the white shirt for so long
build the wall i dont care but man mexico isnt paying for it
my man in the white shirt sounds like hes pro recreational cocaine
the second guy is the reason you need stricter border control
borders will become something of the past lmao this dude is delusional and an imbecile hes saying there will be one country only no borders just one country wow didnt think someone this stupid existed
he definitely doesnt support the wall but supports a ridiculous system where the government can tag and track you where ever you are like a dog wouldnt the wall just be easier and not invasive of your human rights and freedom that guy just doesnt get it at all
did the spanish guy just basically suggest tagging immigrants with electronic tracking tagschips oo oh dear god xd
crowder eat chowder you weed hating canadian fart build bridges and love humanity
just build that fucking wall already
what are they teaching kids in college today 842 i believe therell no borders in 5 to 10 years  thats the stupidest statement ever made and he sits there all proud of himself and his supreme intelligence recording himself going one on one with crowder and  doesnt know dick about anything were doomed
wow guy in white shirt is a liberal balloon head surprise surprise
the earth is round change my mind
wow mexican in white shirt has no clue
the statistics used in this video are ludicrous and not backed by anyone
that guy was on a good one xray wall i think hes on to something
crowder just loves david duke
wall costs too much and it wont stop illegal immigration  change my mind
yeah building the wall is mostly a waste of resources and times rips neighbourhoods apart and so onthe wall will not do too muchit will mostly create a market for high ladders and tunnel diggers meanwhile costing billions with which you can do more usefull stuffit will cost billions more to build loads of cameras staff it and so ondoubt it will do muchdont see extra taxes for such people really working theyd do everything they can to stay illegal then or theyd likely be no better offif they are legal citizens extra taxes for them might be illegal unfair etcits not easywhat is the solution try and make a better world for everyone start somewhere and no the us will not do that it will not do that for its own citizens they are even fine with having swaths of them being blown away from time to time healthcare is crap wages are crap the us doesnt give a fuckin the us no lives matter
is this real life
i love these open border people  how many of them put their kids to bed at night go to sleep themselves and leave their front door unlocked or wide open for that matter  its insane  people are only for open borders if it doesnt affect them directly  what they fail to realize is at some point it will
we know whos doing the drugs
i got a steven crowder add
cmon you cant think building a wall is the best solution we can solve things more smarter than a wall
xray scanner with no boarder this guy should work for nasa cleaning toilets
crowder cant find anyone of anyone to debate of any real intellectual substance
leeroy u aint from spain ur darker than me bro n ur accents thicker than mine bruh
1023 when youve seen way too many scifi movies
a wall would just be ineffective if we build a 20 ft wall all that would happen is there a bigger market for 21 ft ladders
murderers should not be separated from their children change my shorts and mind
lets just take a moment and rethink this sojust tag or give a free green card tothe people who are sneaking in and hereillegally an just make them legal but still make the people who want to come herelegally from other countrysgo throughall ofthe immigration laws what do you think they will do hmmmm  i would go to mexico and sneak in for a free tag you alsohave to funnel them throughto check points to tag them or in essence give them afreegreen card tagyou idiotas far as the ones that are already here you will only be able togive free green cardsto the ones that are caught andor come forward to be tagged i sure wouldnt want to be tagged and pay taxes they seam to do pretty well untagged i like how he says tagged like an animal as well yet we are the racists onesisnt that what a green card is a fucking tag or number in essence any howthe onesalready hereshould be deported first an for most because they are breaking the law in the first place if you are punished for a stupid traffic violation why shouldnt they be punished for breaking a very serious law in the first placethat was the stupidest shit i have ever heard so in essence a digital scanningwallllll that scans them as they pass through to become legal citizensand aquire free green cardsboom justlike that no checking them out to see who or what kind of person they are also if they dont have a tag be for coming across how can they be scannedwe will be in the same boat trying to catch and round up 100 timesas many people now asthey scramble across which bringsus back to funneling them through check points and building some sort of wallwe might as well just call it all america rather thannorth and south america but i dont think we are ready to manage south americas problems at the moment no one says we dont want them here we just want them here legally and documented like the rest of us i do believe he said he is not mexicanhe is spanish his family has just been living in new mexico sense the 1550s really if that were true wouldnt that make him american or at the very least mexican 1550s huh
 now im not saying i am that mastermind but i just invented an x ray border beetch
there are some of these change my minds that really just make me think the world is stupid
opiates uh
super fastuh  thing of the past uh
the 2nd guy ended almost every sentence with an a after the last worda 
well coming from an illegal family we hate to see a wall separating 2 nations but i do agree on deporting the ones that are in jail or have more then 2 dui if people are to come here they should be clean and actually be wanting to work
513 new mexican pride hell ya
wowi cant believe some people actually stop and talk to this guy
the wall is pointless lol
xray border
so the guy in the white shirt is a moron we have ways to become a citizen just follow the god damn steps so instead of requiring people to obey the law we just open the borders and webarcode and scan the people as they cross like some kind of futuristic slave migration oh and i really liked the giant xray wall totally cheaper than just building a border and protecting itchrist i hate these people
im an immigrant and i am the side of law they have to deport illegal immigrants that are not willing to contribute to the society and that are against order not that legal immigrants and citizens are an example of active members of society most of the time they are just as bad as the criminal that we are trying to deport or put in jailthe wall not only is financially impossible is very unlikely to be ever finished maintain and well guarded we have to be realistic about this sure the wall would bring a sense of security but would it majority of the illegal immigrants come as legal tourists and then decide to extant their stay therefore becoming illegal visitors how is the wall going to stop tourists from becoming illegal immigrantsaccording to the httpstraveltradegovviewm2017i001indexasp in 2017 for the first nine months of 2017 we had approximately 55 million visitors legal visitors in the country i ask again how the wall is going to stop themits easy to criticize yell and insult these people but if you have not experienced or follow what happens on a daytoday base you should research what really we do need an immigration reform and figure it out a way to help the people that are in the country but the wall is not the answer
wow dude with the white shirt is an idiot
im against illegal immigration but building a wall is crazy to me it takes up too much time and money money we can be spending on more important things personally i think immigrating to america is way too difficult and takes so long and thats why people are coming illegally people are leaving countries like honduras for example one of the most violent countries in the world so their children can grow up in america and have more opportunities growing up again i dont think people should be coming here illegally but the process of immigration should be refined it takes years to immigrate to america and really only a small amount make it instead of building a wall the process of immigration should be refinedif anyone disagrees with this please let a girl know because i would honestly love to hear what you guys have to say about it
the white shirt guy is playing a lot watch dogs and watching a lot of scifi movieshes like yopeople you gotta pass through scanners and shitand there could be a way of tag an id to see where people are and dont forget the magical xray border
not familiar with lucky palmers virtual wall much more logical and wouldve made his argument even stronger
democrats want people lower than iq 80 infest the countryanyone with brains wont vote for them
oh god that second guy no wall well just use really expensive technology that doesnt yet exist to do basically nothing good idea right
you just have an unique debate style and u basically control where the argument goes youre using skills against normal people talking you know how to control the crowd and keep them on your side you make irrelevant points relevant you provide no facts that sound legit by your tone and then just say the source is online knowing nobody will check when wrong you ask for proof knowing normal people dont walk around with the stats to back up arguments 1 asshole recognizes another  cool channel tho 
while i am hispanic and i dont believe like steven does to build a wall that hispanic guy was dumb as fuck
i understand the immigration concerns but a wall super expensive plus it probably wouldnt even be effective to me an enormous wall sounds like an idea a child would come up with
um people are dumbi applaud your ability to not make fun of that kidbless his heart southern for you aint smart
the first lady made me sad it was sad how she was so afraid
im mexican and i dont care about the wall just that who wants it pays it
xray border did this guy smoke a blunt a half an hour before arriving at the booth
its okay to build the wall but mexico shouldnt pay for the wall cause its americas desire to build it and you know it
im for the us protecting its borders but i think building a physical wall across the whole border is a bad idea the main concern i have with a wall is the interfering with the movements of plant seeds and land animals   i would recommend a virtual wall you put up bright orange concrete pylons with in visible range of each other along the border with an inscription that says in english and spanish these mark the usamexican border it is illegal to cross here if you would like to enter the usa the nearest border crossing is located at location behind that you can bury a wire or a grid of wires that give off an magnetic field and hall sensors that can detect changes to that field whenever something moves near it with a little tweaking it should be able to detect the differences between a human a vehicle a deer etc and if it detect a human it could alert drones to go and document and human border patrol if needed
so he is against an old school wall but if the wall is hightech then its fine
berlin wall 1989 
steven man you should have not put that video of the woman with the plant she could be in danger now for being a snitch and even a blinde person can identify her by her body type her bag and her nurse uniform and skin color you should reedit this fast
how can we tax immigrants or ask for identification when they are coming illegally how do we find these people when they are here illegally they are probably coming here because they dont have money and they need to make money so even if we can tax them somehow they probably wouldnt be able to afford us taxing them
i think we need to make immigration harder but the wall is expensive and unneeded seen as most immigrants come on work visas and overstay there length they are allowed and its sad to have too but we need to get rid of people that we dont have knowledge of who think they can do whatever they want
leroy  dumb as dumb can get build the bloody damn wall maga
37 of crime really  where do you get your numbers from and when it comes about drugs probably 80 of drug users are white american citizens if yall want to stop drug trafficking build more rehab centers for drug users and stop consuming it better yet us hispanics we can build the rehab centers for yall for the right price
funny how his response was just make them legal everyone forgets the motive for trump voters is to keep the jobs they have and opportunities for the next generation not to have it swiped from under them
error 427  we might find some areas where we disagree where we disagree crowder is the best this video is awesome and we all need to join the mug club
build the wall
the wall would leave contractors with a massive project but it is useless in the end most people come here with visitor visas or student visas and just overstay the wall isnt keeping out people who we let in its also a stupid use of billions of dollars when the majority of immigrants who do end up getting here and creating a stable life contribute a lot of money to the growth in our gdp and economic health if we want to help stop immigration flow just work with the government of the countries from which the immigrants originate and help them end corruption and drug trafficking
spanish guy was on adderal 100
conservatives typically want to reduce government spendingalso conservatives build a multi billion dollar walla wall will do very little to stop illegal immigration into america change my mindthe woman even brings up that a wall will do very little to stop illegal immigration and crowder just changes the subject entirely
i dont agree with you at some points but i respect that you sit down and talk civilized with the people all i can say is thanks for being respectful to everybody and staying calm and all thatloving ur content
there could be a border fence  and then both countries can work together on immigration  something like on the mexico side of the border there could be housing for the immigrants that want to come in  and then the us with the help of mexico have  a school that can help these said immigrants learn and study about america and pass a test that can provide them the path for citizenship if people are given this option i believe they would be more interested in coming that way instead of risking getting shot
im against the wall because it points the finger at only one group of people this country was built on immigration  it was made great because of immigration
what a dimwit
we need to build a waaaaaaall
im mexican and i got family in mexico   i say build the wall
i strongly think leroy is how am i gonna say this and not be disrespectful leroy been smoking way too much drugs hes brain is like a kfc chicken breast
this last guy is thinking into some futuristic stuff he is about to create skynet
damn all the latinos on this are fucking retarded come on im mexican and at least i could speak my mind in a understanble way
gotta put yourself in their shoes we all live our nice lives and can comment on these videos with our opinion hiding behind our glass screens trump said it during him campaign to appeal to his voters and now he just wants to keep them at first everyone thought mexico would pay for it now they dont care if the usa pays for it i think we should secure our borders sure but people can still take planes here boats too is trump gonna build a wall on the coast of the florida keys or anywhere in south florida its where i live and ive seen many immigrants come to our shores on boats from haiti cuba etc and trumps got a house where theyre landing mar a lago most of these people just want better lives theyre hard working people goto any restaurant and youll see all the dish washers are haitian very nice people and they will cook the most amazing food trump doesnt understand this he comes down here in south florida every winter and sits in his gold plated mansion while across the bridge theres some bad ghetto where these immigrants live trumps never worked a day in his life hes had a silver spoon since he was born us in america take too many things for granted i guess
one guy is funny i dont want to be tracked more then i already am
im not really sure about all the stuff that goes in to building the wall but i feel that that money could be spent better in other areas like econmics that could help mexico and decrese poverty in mexico and doing something to better stop drug smuggling but im not sure how this stuff works and if my idea would even work
this dude is from 3018 sick x ray boarder idea
the people on this show make me lose brain cells
illegal immigrants commit less crime than us born citizens these arent facts an illegal immigrant will avoid crime to maintain there lives in any country
wouldnt the wall be a pain in the ass to build and maintain
i would love to argue with you about this having both citizenships being born in mexico and living in san diego we could have a great argument because i agree in some points but also disagree with others and i can say complete sentences lmao
wow is this guy on drugs or just stupid
i just dont want to have to pay for a wall that is not even going to be that helpful
somehow i feel as if an xray wall would cost more
the gopro guy has smoked a lot of dope hes still hallucinating
that was hard too watch
i hate the guy in the white shirt
i dig the uh this dude says after everythingi meanuh i digguh whatuh he is sayinguhyepthat was my two cents on the controversial issue
the xray border and being a number in a database i have heard way too many people who support essentially roll time monitoring by the government or zero freedom
we all have to agree building the wall is ridiculous its just a waste of time and money people are going to come regardless
that intro killed me
you cant have social security money and open borders if there isnt a wall then you dont have free shit from the government that is the only solution to not having a wall agree or disagree
that sketchy hispanic guy leeroy talked with a pretty bad accentwhen according to him his family has been in new mexico since the 1550s what a clown
why are people so stupid we can tax immigrants we can use that money to boost the economywhat about the damn money that they would cost the country
dewd scientifical xray borderreally
that was sad how does that guy not realize how idiotic that sounded
these are some of the dumbest people so farchange my mind
this onr is easy whos going to foot the trillion dollar bill oh you and me with taxes right so big fat tax increase for all americans no thanks i dont eant to pay the wall tax plus theres all the armed secruity that has to be paid so that wall tax will just stay forever unlce sam will take another 3 percent fro your pay tp build a wall and man it for the rest of ypur life and meanwhile the illegals will still get in and cause whatever problems that are said to be caused by them and youll still be paying a wall tax but they wont they have no social security or id cant tax illegals so essentially youll pay for an ineffective wall wgile the people you tried to keep out make a killing since they of course dont have to pay taxes
crowder is a true patriot
even though youre the most close minded person on earth you should realise that people have these new things called laddersand shovels walls are retarded motion and thermal cameras would be much more protective and useful
as a result of pres trumps immigration agendathere has been bidding war for trades jobs which in turn makes wages go upas the saying goes the proof is in the puddingthis is a excellent argument for the wall i wish crowder would touch on
oh yeah oh yeah this guy is a real freaking genius not crowder the other one the hispanic guy
build two walls
do climate change next
been illegal is not a raceis a statuschange it get a passport and a permit stop being a lazy fuck do it the right wayhispanics for trump 2020xray borderxrayborderhahhahahahhahahahhahahahahhaahhaahhaha
the second dude thinks that were living in 3050 with all the technology hes proposing
yeah dont waste money building a wall just build a magical exray gate that looks into the soul of prospective immigrants to divine their motivation if they want to commit crimes other than being an illegal alien and affiliation with nefarious organizations  itll be powered by uncorn dust and fairy farts
hi
id rather have a wall than a fucking xray gate and electronic id tags wtf
laser beams
people will found ways around the wall
to put the record straight i am not for illegal immigration but i feel a wall is unnecessary and is just a waste of money and resources and is just an effort in futility will a wall truly keep people out yes it may cut down on illegal immigration but there are more cost effective and time effective ways to cut down on illegal immigration
an xray gate d
wtf did i just watch
i think a physical wall is stupid because thats not gonna stop illegal immigrants from coming in and it would push our country billions of dollars further into dept also we would have to maintain the wall when would cost even more we would also have to pay security workers and builders president bush also built a chain link fence along the border that costed millions so a full on wall would be ridiculous
do this one again
wow she was a master debater
the future will be electronic checkpoints to pass into countries we have a net 0 of mexican immigrants coming into the country meaning the same amount come in as leave the us involvement in central america has led to unrest in mexico and that has to be acknowledged if you want to have a rational conversation the failed and wasted money on the drug war a wall is a complete waste of money when we supposedly have none to spend on infrastructure healthcare or education flints water is still completely dirty along with an incredible amount of other cities in the country over 4000 died in puerto rico  a us territo more then in 911 but the media doesnt report it how can a canadian who has free healthcare and education try and tell us to waste resources on a wall what is this 1045 bc a stone wall is the grand future you envision all this technology advancement but peoples ideals and morality seem to diminish
that spicc watched a cool futuristic movie
the wall would cost too much for us to handle in our current state of dept and most immigrants come by sea or air anyway if you do the research building a physical wall would have little effect on stopping illegal immigration however immigrant reform is needed it needs to stop illegals while accepting more hard working beneficial legals into the country
did he just say we need a xray  scanner border
this guy really is in support of a more futuristic wall
street people talk things with far more sense than university guys they seem cooler dudestheir ideas may be off but they have like good intention
they can go over it under it and plow through it lets waste billions on this because itll totally do something not
honestly people who get so triggered about the wall blow my mind most people just automatically assume its some sort of racist thing to build a wall how do they fail to realize its blocking illegals from literally walking into the usa and leeching off of the society and infrastructure while paying no taxes in return its not even a nuanced thing to understand its like their iq is double digit
new mexico  is fucked
o
minute 7well illegals are 4  of the population and comit 36 of the murdermexican answer  well every body comit crimesfucking hell they are very very unproductive people
there is nothing morally wrong with immigrating agree with the man that we should allow them in and then tax them we shouldnt give them any benefits until they are citizens we will probably get rich off of it or maybe even pay off our debt then we can stop using most of our border force to catch taco sellers and we can take that force and focus the drug dealers
thats a hypothetical that a lot of people who come into this country dont want to pay taxes i support a plan and a path to legal immigration but a wall is just silly to me and financially unsustainable we have far more serious concerns that we need to tackle the job and education system is a cluster right now
is that first guy fucking high he doesnt know what he is talking about at all
the biggest problem i have with it is the environmental factors like preventing migration
what he is trying to propose is an rfid system which still relies on you actually going through the readers even a large scale long range rfid system can be bypassed quite easily if there is no one there to enforce it ie if someone just doesnt have the tag on them and walks through what is the repercussion it would be quite a costly affair and would rely on you being able to tell everyone in every country around you to get this tag its a stupid idea and the solution to the scenario i put forward is a very dangerous mindset and if it were ever suggested i would run for the hills
god is real change my mind
globist shill
please make a better video find people who know what they are talking about
commenting before i watch the video building a wall wont do a lot for immigration it will be extremely costly obviously and according to politifactcom 40 of undocumented immigrants come to the country legally by air mind you and overstay their visas im sure the number would increase if you added the amount of people that come by boat and even more if you add people that are here whom we dont even know about
i dont support the wall but this guy in the white shirt is so fucking stupid
racist people are ignorant change my mind
hes talking about digital tracking you all everyone gets a tracking device on a card or implanted chip its scanned at any airport you go to and if theres an issue you have to explain where youre going and why   you all understood that
build the wall fucking mexicans entering our damn country illegaly
i dont agree with them but hey at least they everyone was respectful
is there an episode where he actually changes his mind
the stuff the guy in white was saying towards the end about the passcodes and technology that would be more oppressive than simply coming in legally with the visa or taking the citizenship test
i do somewhat agree with the first lady i mean in the 21st century a physical wall isnt gonna stop criminals from doing as they please im no expert at border control or how to run a country so i really dont know what to do in this situation to stop them but i am by no means as a citizen going to let my hard earned tax money go towards something like that but hey thats just my two cents yall can disagree thats one of the freedoms we have here right
hey nowno one says that the illegal drugs need a permit just stop the illegal immigrants maybe leave a doggie door for the drugs lol
i think we need to build a wall around the guy in the white shirt
last guy was an idealist without ideas
so how tall of a wall we talking cause i know this great tool called a ladder also walls can be broken soooooooo are we going to hire thousands of more border patrol  whats the wall made of what about the portions wear they swim  if theres a will theres a way it may cut down the number to a certain degree  but wont stop it last point a lot of people have no idea of the process you have to go through how much you have to  pay and the information you have to learn to even come legally is it impossible no but it is hard as hell when a peso equates to so little of the us dollar if you still want to build a wall  reform the way you can get in most build the wall thought  is coming from a racist keep them out mentality instead of  unbais make sure theyre documented mentality
that leroy was a good guy
we need a second edition at a college campus you might have semiintelligent convos there
so what happened at the end
let me say one thing crime rate is 30 for immigrants right we all know thats bogus what about white crime rate there is a lot more whites in jail than any group why are all the school shootings from white males also whos the consumer of the supposal drugs 13 of the immigrants sell whites i really respected his views but his evidence is utter bs
go ahead and build the wall its your border your money  the wall will be useless but anyway whatever floats on your boat
building the wall is the wrong way to go people will get in no matter what so the money should be used somewhere else such as medical or science fields what will a higher wall do people can still dig or swim around it immigrants are not criminals they work hard and contribute to our economy equally as hard as any citizen deport the people who are actually wanted and being searched for dont deport the immigrant looking man shopping at your walmart and claim his crime is stealing a job unless youre native american you and your family were once immigrants so why are you bothered by someone looking for a better place for their family
an xray gate that says when youre there everybody
this dude has a east la accent
wow some people are so stupid its ridiculousbuild that fucking wall
why does crowder only show himself talking with people or are uninformed or crazy theres plenty of competent people whove thought critically on these issues did he only talk to 2 people this whole day
hey guys do u hear a low voice of a children talking from 000 til 035
i belive in tighter border control but the wall is too expensive and illiegal imagrints will still get in we could put outpost with spotlights every like 50ft of the fence
there is no way the dude in the white shirt is going become governer he is way to damn delusional
im for more immigration security and stopping illegals from getting in but what is a wall gonna do
man thats hard to watch xray wall  xray wall will solve it all
wtf be is up with the dumbass hispanic guy adding an a to the end of words the governor of new mexico keep dreaming you fuckinweirdo
such child minded dreamers we could like why do we need laws a lot are hard workeen
100 of illegal immigrants have committed at least one crime
im only against the wall because of the animals that will be affected by it like pygmy owls thats like one of the only reasons
illegals commit 37 of homicides what a bullshit stat that is such a flat out lie that it even sounds wrong rolling off the tongue
build a wall lol how retarded are people in the us
reason not to build the wall money and is it even possible or effective dont new studies show most illegal immigrants are visa overstays and fly into the countryi have seen studies showing thatthe usa economybenefits from these workers doing fruit picking and other non skilled work now correct me on that if you will but a wall does not seem effective in this modern world i mean it didnt work for china lol
i like the since fiction ideas from the guy in the whiteboard shirt
dude in the white shirt is a fucking idiot  wow
this mexican guy is a dunce
lmao that guy in the white shirt is an idiot  my family came from spain to mexico in the 1550s youre mexican you fucking idiot
that is a great syfy novelhe should get a movie deal
simple is ussless
no point in building a wall look at how drugs and illegal immigrants get into this country its not from walking across the border that a wall would prevent the actual 1 cause of illegal immigration is from flying with fake ids some of the same ids can be used hundreds of times and keep getting mailed back to fly across similar looking individuals also fishing vessels and tunnels dwarf illegal immigration by above land that a wall would potentially prevent its sad how uninformed politicians and people like you are about the reality
wow that was the most useless 13 minutes of my entire life neither you nor any of the arguers had any coherent points to make way to choose the worst demographic possible stevey eat a dick
that spanish dude was on something its obvious lol but poor guy at least he tried
i love how the first woman contradicted herself when she asked how to report the money launderers it proves a much bigger point how the wall can help people who are here legally
holy shit this dude solved our problemsan xray border
422we might find areas where we disagree vs where we disagree
we need an xray thingy to xray people that pass people and like enters them into the like database man o man this man is dreamin
wrecked that pooor autistic kids
the build the wall idea is to bring more security and we all know security will be at the cost of our freedoms wake up people thomas jeferson said anyone that chooses security and liberty doesnt deserve either
how can you be racist if you cut yourself off from other races think about it people
my view on this as an egyptian who needs a visa to visit every single country and not really accepted easily in most countries with doubts that i might stay illegally even though i can afford my travel which makes me prono borders as its the case in europe between european countries if you make the immigration process simple and acceptable for everybody since were all humans that have the right to live wherever we are and shouldnt be judged as humans based on our race or belief we shouldnt be judged according to where we were born too plus the fact that when you ban something it becomes more likely to be wanted so when you do not make traveling between borders hard people wont risk their lives to do it as much as when you prohibit it if i have the right to travel anywhere like americans or europeans i wont be eager to think that i should illegally immigrate and risk my life and my familys life to do that since it became a choice so i will be happy to apply for a residence permit and be legal if i need to live in another country and perhaps regarding the tax issue if people are below a certain income then perhaps they dont need to pay taxes since most of the illegal immigrants are working in the lowest paying jobs anyways they are just under the radar so as a conclusion i see there should be no discrimination against any other nations people based on where were they born since that cause them to either stay poor in their own country or be illegal immigrants if their status doesnt allow them to fit within the current eligible candidates second there should be acceptance by all countries that whoever wants to travel anywhere he should be granted that according to the law he should follow the law of the hosting country should be legal resident should follow easy procedures like the ones europeans have between their borders just travel with their id no need for a passport even but the passport is not the issue here of course third people should treat others as normal human beings i dont mind people coming to my country politely working with me and making money they are not stealing me and treating me like shit and they take all the goods like the occupation of the us to most of the countries of the old occupation of countries to one another no just workig side by side as normal human beings then i wont feel imprisoned in my country if i needed to leave or if i see that america or australia fits my preferences and my life goals there shouldnt be nationalism anymore and the idea that we as egyptians are the owners of this piece of land so we control everyone else and we americans are the best in the world and anyone else coming to us is going to take our goods and should be treated like shit and we english are the uniques of the earth and no one should take our jobs all of the nationalism is bullshit build a wall like old historic cities to provide easy residence and work permits if you want or make laser beams that doesnt matter most importantly is how to unite all as one again and let everyone who wants to immigrate and complete his or her life elsewhere actually able to do that
you wanna know what the best argument against building a border wall is  because it would end up being just another piece of infrastructure that america refuses to properly maintain  drops mic youre welcome  seriously look at your roads bridges power grid sewage etc etc etc  theres nothing in this countrys infrastructure that even approaches being well maintained  so a border wall would literally be just another piece of infrastructure that continuously falls into and out of disrepair
my family has been in new mexico since the 1550s
second guy i can level with he wants to optimize the way people become legal citizens i agree with that i believe in maximizing the border security while making the process as good as possible make it faster but also harder to pass the criteria america wants the hard working legal citizens for our great country
he wants to be governor of nm but he cant put one concise sentence together sounds about right
that last guys parents mustve lied and told him he could be whatever he wanted to be when he grew up it doesnt work that way your incoherent rambling will get you no votes
i love what steven does and i am someone who has been a liberal and is much more center right now  something id like somebody to explain though is why people care so much about illigal immigrants  to some of you this probably sounds insane but i really do not see much of a problem with illigal immigrants
you dont need the wall you need to take away the incentives as to why they come here you need to take away all of the benefits and handouts that they get if they dont have the incentives to come here you then cut down on spending and you dont have to spend money on a wall will it completely stop all of them from coming here illegally no will the wall stop all of them no they already come here via tunnels through the air and water the wall is useless heres another thought use returning military to beef up the security it gives them a job and they will be doing something that they are familiar with
1053 we should just put shock collars on all the mexicans with an invisible fence
losing brain cells by the second both so stupid shouldnt b allowed to leave the house
the mark of the beast i know what he is talking about the frid chip inplant
the guy in the white shirt is trying so hard to look smart for his little camera wow what is even coming out of his face my brain hurts i gotta go im late for my meeting with my masterminds to disgust this
im sad because i cant get a job in my area because there is so many mexicans if they got deported all the kids and people in my area would have jobs again
how do you broadcast statistics that are highly inaccurate and try to claim to be open to discussion immigrants illegal or otherwise do not commit crimes at higher percentages than native americans
all of these people just spread random blabber
that spanish guy is fucking mental
hey hey over here how do i report does ppl
the statistics numbers are fucking lie black and white americans are crackheads and kill and steal day and night  where the fuck you getting these fake statistics from
sounds like cattle tracking bet old slave owners would have loved something like this i know todays thugs would
trump is americas president       change my mind
lets see how your president deals with our brand new president  i wanna see your wall 
the guy in the white shirt is from the twilight zone or has smoked some really good shit  i want some of that
even though i agree with crowder 95 of the time i would just once like to see a well informed individual present a well thought out cohesive and fact based argument against crowder
name some examples of massive walls actually workingare we going to name the wall the 2nd berlin wall
yeah i guess were going to build a wall so my generation can bust that wall down to celebrate unityhistory reapets itself the wall will destroy america and its people its just to costly to build
please do a part two of this and somehow get more people to talk to you
this guy wants the mark of the beast 666 from the book of revelations
cuz said xray scanners 
that last dude was on something 
dude wants a laser wall awesome
ugh im commenting too much but pharmaceuticals arent much of a problem anymore well painkillers arent the benzos and psychotics are a problem but thats cause people like to get locked into a drug induced fantasy world a wall would keep most of the heroin out of the country as its being shipped from countries like afghanistan to mexico then to the us not like heroin is coming from canada
i was talking to my dad about politics a little bit ago he is left i am centrist and i was talking about a lot of the things steven said here my dad raised a great point though that seems to be true from my research while migrants cost us money the first generation their second and third generations actually pay that back and then some i wonder what stevenyou guys think about this as i cant find any counterargument in media which is left wing
how do you make money off someone that doesnt exist in your system lol that second guy was dumb as shit i think we need stricter deportation laws  an electronic id tag so you want to treat immigrants as though they are lions and you put a tag on them sometimes i think these people dont actually hear the shit that plops out of their mouths
damn isnt a wall a bit too much holy shit
china has a great wall none of these people seem to give a shit about that
you wont see this truth on mainstream media that poor woman needs help along with her community at large sanctuary laws are derogatory to the safety and wellbeing of the legal immigrants and their communities
i think these people think that this wall would be solid without any gate for officially passing the border lol
for that supposed spanish american  if we dont know who the illegals are where they are and what work they do cause they are getting paid under the table  how the hell do we tax themas for that first gal the supposed legal immigrant how long has she been here  cause she certainly sounded like someone whos barely learned the language
americans are so dumb wow
the current fence is good enough just double down on deporting those legally in the nation
an xray wall ehh hahahaha smoke the bong some more
dudes a fucking retard xray boarders that is a ridiculous idea just build the fucking wall
the title got me triggered lol
building a wall is costly and useless illegal immigrants are already going through extreme measures to cover me here a wall wont stop them theyll dig under climb over it knock a whole through it there already risking there lives so whats a wall we do have to find a solution but a wall is a half as idea
who monitored the pilgrims are they not illegal immigrants too who is really american or legally american  and the illegal immigrants do pay taxes they do not file for taxes most of them where do you think that billion dollars a few years ago came from no one is going to stop the real americans who have been here thousands of years to claim this land back
that ladies face looks familiar
he wants to be the governor of new mexico  
white shirt is a pinball in a pinball machine
maybe his thought is that the space force will be able to track microchips that illegals willingly have planted in them 
fuck you thats our money going into it if youre not a us citizen this doesnt apply to you
are they gonna like fill in all the underground paths and stuff because its not just about the surface
750  did he just almost say get then married haha
the guy in the white is delusional
build the xray border scientifcal border gate and id tag every immigrant just dont build a wall oh and be sure to bring a note
that actually has happened with immigrants being scared to call the police watch my video on little luz perfect example
omg your face at the end
his family has been in new mexico since the 1550s
i feel like you seek out easy targets
that second guy sounds like a conspiracy theorist nut job xd
we need no borders but xrays  got it
illegal immigrants are necessary for the american economy it has  been shown that allowing more migrants reduces illegal immigration give more people green cards and allow them to come and go more freely reduces people staying for fear of not coming back
that spanish guy is actually extremely stupid because travel will get more efficient and faster borders wont exist lol what are you rambling about
the white t shirt guy actually seems really cool and kind but hes just misinformed and uneducated
well if we stopped the drugs from coming in then nobody here period would be able to sell them
a wall isnt going to prevent visa overstays which is a huge part of the immigration problem
lol people are that upset and terrified of a wall to protect our border and help monitor only letting in people that go through the process
the guy in the white shirt  wtf  an xray border
so youre telling me people illegally crossing the border is illegal reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
haha  that last guy was hilarious
the next governor of new mexico leeroy trujillo
maga
the only good ones are held at college campuses because they have the most knowledge and can actually think critically when making there points it seems that many of these people are flooded with fake news and stuff that they read or hear on tv
xray border lmaoooo this guy is on drugs
so if i understand this buddy there wants everyone to be like microchiped and and scanned whenever they cross the a border so that they could be registered immigrants instead of illegal ones but what this boils down to is that he wants all illegal immigrants to just become legal immigrants wouldnt that just increase all the problems you mentioned with immigration
its insane how liberals say stuff like this but try to make stereotypes for conservatives
we need the wall
that spanish dude is so uneducated
this episode second hand embarrasses me
heres why we shouldnt build the wall 1a  majority of illegal immigrants came here legally and just overstayed their visas 2 much of the us mexico border is on the rio grande riverprivate property so building a wall would be very difficult impossible or unethical 3 a wall that big would be incredibly expensive to buildmaintain and there are better ways to spend that money
its a fact that wallsborders work
we need the wall that is all that is to be said it is common sense we need a strong border and thats when the wall comes in we need to know who is coming into our country and they need to come legally has nothing to do with being racist it has to do with defending america and for people to follow the law whenever illegals get what they want from america that is a smack in the face to all the immigrants that come here legally
man this one was painful  probably should have kept this one in the b file
this is the only thing i disagree with you on
this video is why usa should build the wall
what about the interruption of the migration patterns of shit loads of animals by dividing the ecosystem with an impassible object
i have a question has there ever been a time when your mind has actually been changed
i thought most illegal immigrants came over by plane on visas and just overstay if thats true wouldnt the issue of building a wall and strengthening the physical border be irrelevant also where are the funds coming from for this wall trump said he wanted mexico to pay but why would they do it
illegal immigrants commit 37 of homicides why do i feel like thats total bullshit statistics
this gentlemen is clueless just wants to here himself talk
i hate that guya who talksa like thisa
have you every been convinced
why firstly the majority of the drugs trafficked into the us are brought by plane and boats sometimes hidden away in vehicles says the deahttpsforeignpolicycom20170829trumpsaysborderwallwillstopdrugshereswhatadeaintelreportsaysas for illegal immigration white people are you gonna pick that fruit theres a reason immigrants are considered harder workers fact immigrants have helped america in every single field possible growing and developing america as a whole then the majority of citizens currently bitching and complaining about jobs they refuse to work anyways lol thats the ironic bullshit about america its not america thats bullshit its the self righteous ignorant idiots destroying the country everyone thinks theyre right yet no one researches everyone piggy backs on another idiotic persons bias views especially when it fits theyre personal opinion so please get rid of all immigrants with this wall that once again statically wont stop people from crossing google it the first fact is free but the second i want you americans to learn something new trump sold you americas biggest lie and like morons and idiots you guys ate it up and suckered that overly long red tie please continue destroying america cause you wanna be right
i think it was jordan peterson that said 1 out of every 10 people have an iq of less than 85 its really easy to see that this past year with the screaming herd of retards who are too dumb to debate
at the 845 mark the scatterbrained leftist from new mexico admits hes against borders and wants open borders for america but his adhd seems so bad that im not sure he even comprehended the format of im for building the wall try to change my mind
damm you tracked your family history back to 1550s nice job
how about instead of building a wall we get information distributed on how to legally immigrate to the united states if these other countries are so bad that we are doing food drops and sending humanitarian efforts there we should send information in their languages on how our immigration process works im all for immigration as long as its done legally
smh the 2nd guy needs to study to be stupid
the debates went way off topicimmigration reforms are neccessarybut wouldnt it be better to invest funds in personnel rather than a bunch of bricks that would most certainly affect the wildlife and agriculture that surround the river
steven crowder has never changed his mind on one of these the hypocrite change my mind
give them a scarlet letter
lets get rid the wall and replace it with a border that has something like a checkpoint or gate but instead lets add xray machines and chip every one d that was the best mental gymnastics eversome how he came up with even more hard forced border with xray machines whilst arguing that should be no border anywhere that borders should just go 
do you have a fence on your property why to keep people from illegally entering your property same with our country keep em off my property
look obviously we need to know who is coming into our country but if youre dumb enough to think we should waste  billions on a wall youre a special kind of stupid
honest question are border security and the wall the same thing if so how
the guy in the white shirt made me feel embarrassed to be from new mexico i assure everyone that he is not representative of new mexican citizens we may be toward the bottom in public education but i believe most of us know that scientifical is not a word i love my home state but if leroy trujillo is ever elected governor of new mexico i may have to consider moving new mexico is a great place so please dont use him to measure the rest of the population here
makeamericagreatagain  we let the mexicans pay for the electrical bill for the huge ass xray wall
put land mines all over the place
how can you sit that long and try to make sense from that fucking moron that dude is a fucking idiot
congrats you debate random weirdos on the street
i literally could not finish watching
i swear he finds the most incompetent people to argue with
my family has been in new mexico since like 1550
are you brave enough to ask people to change your mind that god exists would be interested to see the discussions
man why did you make me watch that stupid mexican talk haha that was a waste of time
both these people had no idea what they were talking about
am i suppose to take this guy serious xrays really this is what happens when you smoke weed and play video games way too much
get me off this planet  the stupids are multiplying at a staggering rate
personally i think the wall should be built just not with mexican money however it could kill of endangered species and endanger some species like the jaguar and mexican wolf we would be destroying the beautiful nature even more that being said my dad came here illegally he got a good job his boss helped him become legal and now we live in a 400000 house in california although that doesnt mean everyone is going to be good when they come here so on some points it should be built but on others it shouldnt unless it can have a way to not do damage to the beautiful nature i am all for itedit i forgot to mention the reason my dad came here illegally was because at the time he would be forced into the army for a few years before he was allowed to leave
its called an airplane u dumbass
3rd world immigrants take more out of the system than they put in within a year  after paying little because they are poor to no taxes have a child and get wic foodstamps pregnancy medicaid for the mother and lifetime medicaid for each child and other federal subsidies they also culturally do not limit their births especially when subsidized one month of foodstamps is 10 more than taxes payed in a month
no lets use our tax money on making th wait to make the space force d hahaha
wanting to be governorexpressing free thoughtsmh
this spanish dude is a little slow he makes no sense deport them all
deport the last guy
i would love to see steven and ben shapiro team up 
build the wall with your ass bitch
so the first lady is saying shes against illegal immigration but thinks the wall is unnecessary honestly i agree i think its kinda a waste but really idk i dont have the facts so it could be better and ill trust our president
what shocked me was just how ignorant some of these people were and how some would just yell and the argument i hear most often is just oh its racist but thats probably because im still in school
if you are not here legally get the fuck out and come back the right way
i almost had a seizure 
1315 my face throughout leeroys explanation
i guess youll have to put a chip in their arm so you can track them  the mark of the beast
it saddens me that people are so selfish and so egotistical that they cant even come up with a more rational solution coming here without proper documents is breaking the law i get this but to point your finger at every single citizen from another country and accuse them of being criminals rapists drug traffickers etc is just wrong if people really believe in the bible or have an ounce of decency in them they wouldnt put blame on others and treat them so cruel on top of this usa was founded by immigrants so in theory every non indian should be deported stop the hate and act like adults
the guy in the white tee was trolling to get material for his showit was obvious from the start of their conversation
so sad how stupid these fucking people are
the deadpan look at the end was priceless
that ladys cool she  doesnt like the saying build that wall because shes probably feels like its assuming everyones bad but still wants more security on the border and legal ways to get in  sounds like she loves america and isnt racist  rare breed
this was the hardest to listen to change my mind every sentence he says ends with ahh  imigrantsahh
im so frustrated listening listening to his logic white tshirt mexican guy is a dolt
that mexican guy is an idiot
white tshirt guy idiot
the drug cartels are hardworking people
the wall is pointless as long as 3 letter agencies stand to reap profits and power in the war on drugs
where do you get these people i disagree with most of the things you say but these people make no sense sad to see this 
my mind will not be changed change my mind
why ask idiots
what did he smoke before talking to you 
you need to get more yusefs in front of you instead of these idiots  must be screening for them now
i just cant stop commenting as i watch the video since the dude gets more retarded as he talks wtf there isnt a question about making people go through proper process of migration  you dont funking need imaginary unicorn pass codes to identify ur dumbass people go through proper documentation processes when they are legally trying to enter the border legal procedure whether electronic or not isnt even the question since that falls under which methodology should we adopt to let people enter legally the people in question are those who will cross the borders illegally whether or not the border is made of bricks or some xray technology he is a just a complete loser
yeah with technology running so fast there wont be borders and these illegal criminal rats will be patriotic americans along with terrorists loving america just give technology a chance no wait give iphone and these small hand cams a chance as they progress from 1 model to the other the world will just become borderless just like the iphone screen becoming larger and larger with those borders fading the dude is a joke he outright made an irrelevant mark by stating that he is not a mexican but spanish trying to provoke a thought like being a mexican is just bad with that kind of attitude and mental dumbness good luck defending your point oh wait u dont have a point period
the second guy isnt very clever
if all these pathetic people are against building the wall the solution is simple actually very simple dont build the wall and straight up evade mexico make it us territory call these mexicans now americans and there wont be fuss but no no no no  that wouldnt be something that you  will want either all you want is these illegal immigrants to hop right into us and no body to say anything because u think they have the  right so  simply pathetic then dont start to complain when we americans start to go in mexico and start claiming things cause then for sure i know u will wine about boundaries and country origins and if building a defense against erosion of american soil by these rats is a horrible idea then why should us even build defense from other nations what makes u better simply us should then not have defense at all and let whoever the fuck do whatever the fuck they want 
chuck norris facts are true change my mind
i bet the mexican in the white shirt was high af before sitting downpeople would travel very fast in the next 510 yearsoh no look out kids mexicans can teleport to our country
nothing wrong with immigration reform but a physical wall is gonna cost too much for americans  why did no one frame that argument this one was easy no way in hell mexico will pay for a wall
as a mexican i agree the us have the right to build a wall with their own money being sincere i built a 10 feet wall in my property to protect it but i used my money not others people
the wall will accomplish nothing the real solution is to find who the illegal immigrants are then offer them a choice they have 1 year to pay all the taxes they owe the american population if they do then heres a visa and the paperwork to become a legal citizen if they dont send them back to the country they came from theres a level of forgiveness but a stern lack of tolerance for stealing from the population
i feel like a lot of newer democrats that only got into politics when trump began targeting illegal immigrants are misinformed theyre much easily swayed by fake news which is a big problem theyll watch cnn or whatever instead of watching two credible news stations from both sides to formulate an opinion based on the truth and the full truth at that most of these people tend to be very hard headed too which is sad thats why when i see people flaming trump i really dont care anymore because i know for a fact 90 of those people dont know what theyre talking about and only hate trump because of things their friends or fake news stations told them he said or did in past or present
how do you stop illegal immigration without building a better barrier between us and them do you want us to be shooting them as they come across the border or something to make an example i think if we didnt build the wall wed have to beef up the border security by a lot and also arm them better with more technology to stop these unwanted aliens they dont deserve to be here so we wont allow them to come here
build that wall 
im no specialist in this field of study im for building a wall but im worried about how if they cant come in by land they will have to use other means of crossing the border and im not about to trust their airports with the people that are determined to cross because then we could have another 911 in play and i say could because i dont believe they are all suicide flyers but if they control the planes anything can happen
the guy in white tshirt is on drugs and i think he has drugs and possible tax cash in his backpacklolxray scannerlmao
does he ever change his mind
illegals pay taxes too fact
that lady dont knowwhat thefuck she talking about shes gonna get fuck
the second guy sounds like my friend mcfly
my god this guy is so stupidhe makes no sense at allmake them free flowing what
i would understand a wall if the indigenous people of these lands wanted them as a nation built on plunder rape and theft its bais to set a standard we wouldnt follow ourselves being a generation of immigrant alot more nations should be heading back overs seas if you think this a good idea hell superman gotta go too
off course they bring crime they come here illegaly and cant get a job so are they just gonna starv to death
lol tax people you dont have documented dx ray fence sounds good to me if youre willing to get cancer youre escaping something and if you bring your kids you endangered the child xd
maga  massively awesomely gaped anus 
so i watched a few of these and thought this guy was really well informed i was impressed with the research he had done for the two genders one but i looked it up and the statistic he sites saying that the 25 percent of our population that are illegal immigrants are causing 30 of the crime in america is completely untrue he is quoting trump who was quoting a bogus article written years ago there are many many statisticsarticles that prove this estimate wrong that 25 percent would have to be committing crime at an impossible rate please dont let this man further the racism in this country research the things you hear from him and anyone else on the internet i was shocked that he would use something so very untrue to argue his opinion here are a couple sources proving him wrong a simple google search would further show that that statistic is completely fabricated httpswwwnprorg20180502607652253studiessayillegalimmigrationdoesnotincreaseviolentcrimehttpswwwnytimescominteractive20180330upshotcrimeimmigrationmythhtmlhttpscrimsasupennedufactcheckdomexicanimmigrantscausecrimei stole thisbtw
 we might find some areas where we disagree vs areas we disagree 
x ray boader hahahahahahahahah build the fucking wall
not an american but isnt a majority of a illegal immigration from people overstaying their visas so building a physical wall would not only be hugely expensive but in the long run ineffective as a majority of immigrants literally fly over the border
i seriously doubt the spanish dude and his family had been here since the 1500s
build an invisible ex ray border lol
not a wall fencing is a much cheaper and more realistic option
this just goes to show the ignorance of society
governor of new mexico lol
you dont understand fundamental human rights go ahead  tell me what rights are and where they come from  no person or group of people have valid property rights over the imaginary boundary known as the national border and thus have no moral justification for inhibiting the free movement of any person crossing that arbitrary line case closed all other considerations are invalidated by their lack of acknowledgement of this core principle
that second dude watches too much black mirror
lol tax people that arent citizens how you do that timmy
219 hellooooo beautiful
i think they should deport stupid ppl
thats the dumbest shit ive heard in a while
this is so stupid  way to chose the people you interview  your so clever 
steven crowder is funded by pro government agendas
xray im pretty sure this guy means rfid dear god
steven just an fyi the woman whose face you blurred you did not blur her face on her name badge
im guilty of not watching the entire video but honest question here is steven crowder actually in favour of building a physical wall i understand improving immigration reforms and laws completely but isnt it already proven that building a wall is pretty much useless and is a complete waste of money since most illegal immigrants come to the us via planes anyways
that face at the end was a fuckin masterpiece
heres my question what will a wall do
drugsuh data baseuh opiatesuh jesus christ that dude in the white tshirt is a legitimate retard there are so many issues with his digital passcode solution god help new mexico if he ever becomes their governor
i dont understand some peoples view of this wall subject bottom line is if we dont protect our borders we will become like the countries these people come from we cant continue to bring people in who are dependent on the government and sending thier home countries money for aid if they become legal they will vote foe more government programs and we will endup like them
such a dbag
gay
xray gate 
we got a lot of drive by yellinghow uncivilits as if this whole segment is done entirely in bad faith
a fucking x ray border
why are the real illegal aliens acting as acting as if this land is their land
you really cant tax illegal immigrants because like he said the majority of illegal   legal immigrants are dirt ass poor therefore they dont want to pay taxes and arent going to pay taxes because they cant nor do i agree or think that the government should be giving them free handouts thats our taxpayer money theyre getting and i sure as hell am not giving them my hard earned money i do agree with what the guy said  about borders being a thing of the past especially in the next couple  years history has shown us that borders dont work and the majority of them get torn down i believe in border protection but the border walls dont last  everyone wants to preserve their own race but the evolution of humanity especially mixed human race im afraid is inevitable
im sorry but you people realize that there already is a border wall right  the whole point is to have a better one that actually keeps people outim a little confused why people are so against this
xray wall
this dumbass thinks its 2200
even though i usually like the changemymind series i think this one ist just stupid seriously im sorry but me as a german who experienced a wall dividing his country for years cant fucking understand this it blows my mind how people think a wall is a good idea or even a solution
by that sense walls should be built around every country to stop illegal immigration good video
the argument i hear is that they illegals will find another way in i disagree   i like to trap them by asking them why mexico has border security along their southern border and why no public benefits are given to illegal immigrants to mexico
i wish you came up against someone who knew what they were talking about what about boats planes and tunnels for instance and imagine all the time and effort put into doing this when it could be used in other ways to improve security you missed the nail with this video
this guy was on drugs or something
im not for illegal immigrants but building a wall would be a waste of money
a wall is not very partial financiallypractically or very useful a wall is very easier to go over but more camera and maybe station out post along with some new invotions in security would sure help i will look more into it
im not for the wall or against it cause i can see the positives as well as negatives towards doing this its to stop or slow down immigrants coming into america but lets be real here even building a wall wont stop this my whole view about illegal immigrants is that i dont mind about honest people wanting to have a better life as well as to get away from dangerous situations im not ok with bad guy immigrants coming here and causing american citizens issues or hurting the american people the only thing that upsets me about immigration is that they feel entitled to get everything an american citizen gets and demand they get these privileges even though they arent citizens no offense but i dont wanna have to pay for someone to come over here especially when they demand that we do they have no right to demand anything from the american government what so ever the point to be a citizen is to prosper and help your fellow american be successful and succeed in life but for someone that came here illegally and tell me i have to cater to their wants is crap and if you pay taxes then you should agree there are right ways to do this to get citizenship as well as help from the government by doing it the right way but for someone to sneak in and tell us that we have to pay for them to get free food housing school medical is down right crazy thats like some stranger coming into your house and demanding you that you have to feed that person and their family as well as them telling you that you will treat them like how you treat your family wouldnt go over so well see if someone wants to sneak here and then fine but dont come over asking for a free hand out and start attacking americans for not doing what you want just like 5 months ago in dc when they tried protesting to the government but the government wouldnt give them anytime cause theyre not citizens so what did they do caused damage and attacked americans physically and verbally for not getting their way which alot of people were arrested and deported cause of that my main point here is that you only get government funding and help if youre a citizen if someone wants to cheat the system and jump the line while others doing it the right way get screwed over then whatever but dont demand or expect us to pay your way just cause you see what we have and get for being born here you want the same rights then fine go back to yalls countries and get it dont hurt us cause you dont get your way js thats my opinion was all
ground planes and maybe walls would be effective
the dude in the white shirt sounds like hes mad by his tone
he just smoked a spleef laced with ecstasy sprinkled with jimmies lol he actually proposed something worse than a wall an xray gate hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
gave thumbs down for this video not cuz im against the wall but these two wasted your time  x ray wall wtf
just tax them wow problem solved this guy must be a rocket surgeon
lmao wow
that last guy is he hopped up on something or is he really that dumb
send that dude leroy back
someone tell me how its not okay to have a wall between usa and mexico but its okay for mexico to have a wall between mexico and guatemala
why is crowder asking for comments when he used to make fun of commenters and say that he didnt even read the comments so go for it
did that one dude just say we should use the mark of the devil and use an implanted rf coded device to track people wtf
and this is why  big demographic changes to your population are a disaster cuz most immigrants are for more immigration while the natives want less immigration  at least in europe
i was on xbox live when i ran into so many illegal immigrants into my game and they told me how they got here and then when i started confronting them i started getting all defensive and acting really nervous and then they left
build a wall with your ass
and this is the start of idiocracyplease dont do anything political guyyoull hurt yourself by thinking lol maybe ask you master minds
after leaving the conversation the man in the white shirt bought a can of tuna and spent a week trying to formulate an idea on how to open it
fake news illegals commit 33 of us homicide  what a lot of crap
how this poor guy can stay so polite when faced with total idiots is beyond me
that second dude should shut his mouth because he sounds like a complete and utter idiot
leeroy was very special
leeroy should become a professional speaker
use a siege tower
how big is the wall
a wall only makes the bribing border patrol more expensive for the drug cartels which will in turn just drive up cias price and the crooks that are us citizens will now be walled in with us with less of a chance of them hopping the border
there is no legitimate argument against the wallthats why all their arguments sound so stupid
alot of youtubers use austins public as entertainment i wonder the reason
1317 that look
this guy in white is living in a fantasy
do mexicans own ladders or shovels
your god is not real change my mind
opioids are coming from mexico people are dumb border patrol separates illegals not ice abolish dems trump 2020
illegals dont pay taxes even if they marry an american they still dont pay taxes
they dont care about our laws they can kill someone and just go back to mexico or venezuela or where ever they are from
build a wall i have an idea to pay for it with out the dems help or approval dems are dumb abolish dems
im cringing so hard while watching this video the people hes interviewing have no idea what theyre talking about
we have been wasting millions no trillions of dollars of dollars since the 70s to fight the war on drugs
hey guys did you know borders are gonna be a thing of the past in 510 years because technology
this guy just made raza look dumb
when someone smashes into a car removing the bumper and then tries to drive off because they could not provide a drivers license identification insurance citizenship true story btw its time to build a border
that last guy was definitely from the futureor on one serious pipe dream
the look on your face at the end of the video is worth a million likes priceless
giving anyone who crosses the boarder cancer now thats fucked up
wait hold up might be mentioned on the video but isnt there a wall already or at least something acting as a blockade
as a former border patrol agent i would love to speak to you about the facts regarding the wall and give you real information i am for the wall and i am hispanic
lol we can tax the people coming in no shit mexican moron again lol im not mexican ive been here since the 1500 so hes christopher colmartinez dude needs to lay off the mescaline this is boring hood politics
steven i was fucking drinking coffee at 1315 wtf
it really seems that all democrats are straight up communists and socialists
forget the middle east  pull the troops out and putt them in mexico  mexico needs its ass beat 
i cant  stand all these people saying a wall wont stop them     like can u fucking prove that    they just keep saying that as if its fact   we have all the proof in the world that it would help drastically but they get to just walk around repeating their bull shit lies as though they know it as fact      every other country that has ever built a wall  modern times including  has had success      y is america different  ffs 
im 13 and  can create a way better argument then these people
yeahsurean xray gate
you know trump supporters if you collect all the shit that endlessly dribbles out of your mouths and asss and put it into the trunk of your hillbilly wagon you could just drive down there and start building the thing with your hands  you know actually get directly involved  community service and all that   im sure you could fabricate a good turd wall in almost no time
i dont think the second guy knows what a wall is
wtf
i do not understand half of the things some of these opposers are saying 1010 what the fuck is he saying excuse my language
you really think building a physical wall is right
that guy has his own scientifical whatever sort of channel
why not invest the money meant to pay for the wall and instead use the interest to pay for more staff and equipment a wall seems pretty easy to dig under
man if he has been thinking a lot about this i would hate to hear his view before thinking
not gay jared lookin like a mal nourished stylish european bodyguard over there
your face at the end was priceless lol
i cant watch anymore  i love the idea of change my mind but are there any intellectual minds that come to debate you  or is that the point  show the foolish to prove a point  please change my mind as i would like to watch more
im against the wallwe should have exray stations and electronic id tags
how about a wall of sentry turrets
that spanish guy was sooooooooooooooo dumb omg
building a wall would waste money smh
too short but enjoyable nonetheless
the wall does not look nice and it wont stop enough real crime from coming over wall is usless
the wall does not look nice big cartels dont give a fuck about a wall they jump fucking walls they are big and rich and have connections
gee leroy has no idea about anything he sounds so sincere and confused make a good politition 
that guy must of done a shit ton of coke before he sat down hahahaha
texas is gone
white shirt guy does cocaine for sure i dont want a board i propose xray machineswhat the f
im sorry to say but your statistics are off sorry to say
i can not believe this represents what my people think we are fooled by a patriotism to a country we do not know fooled to feel loyalty to people we do not know and willingly support criminal behaviour rules are put there for a reason
i feel as if its a waste of money
if california succeeded the union would they build a wall to keep the us out
i do not think we should build a physical wall when we have already developed border monitoring technology  its immediately available could be installed for a fraction of the cost and it would create more permanent jobs imo
hey steven love these videos of yours  id like to make the humble request of you putting your statisticssources as links in the descriptions of your videos  im a skeptic at heart for all positions and it would really help me and other skeptical viewers agree with your positions  keep up the civil conversations
is this guy advocating for the adoption uhf rfid technology to be1 implanted into immigrants2 installed in cities across american to track said uhf rfid tagsuhhhhhh whathttpsyoutubeuhdim73fzn0t11m4s
making mexico pay for it will hopefully reduce their ridiculous inflation as well as tightening border security
the way the second guy talks is so cringe
i saw a documentary about an experimental society where travel was unrestricted all over the planet  fostered in part by a very sophisticated transportation system that allows people to traverse hundreds of miles in mere seconds it was hosted by patrick stewart
1045 sarah were going to need you here
the liberal opinion is invading more privacy and overall less freedom lmao
my idea would need to be figured out by like a team of mastermindsooooohhh ok bro
my issue with the wall is that people are trying to claim land that didnt even belong to them that was literally stolen from natives to the country who were forced to migrate to shitty reservations that have little access to resources then all of a sudden americans whypeepul want to act like something is ours to protect if an illegal commits a crime just throw their assesout if they dont who gives a shit let them do the shitty jobs that we lazy uppity americans dont want to do like pick our produce and build houses in 100 weather
the drugsuh
i wish this conversation could be had again especially with more latinos such as the ones that came up i think a lot are more conservative than the radical left would have you believe and like the first lady a lot would be agreeing with your points  im for a border wall absolutely i think it would quickly pay for itself and would make mexico safer as the drug cartels would lose a lot of money smuggling drugs weapons and people across the border  i also think we should legalize pot and prostitution to stop their monopoly  finally i think the process for becoming a citizen should be merit based as opposed to the random system we have now and streamlined with less fines and waiting time
meanwhile in california our produce rotsconservatives are silly im not liberal btw but i have common sense which i think a lot of conservatives and some liberals lack
you picked the wrong spot to do this find another and do it again
families belong together in their home countries migration is not a fundamental human right
1 theres already a border wall 2 there is no illegal immigration problem 3 airplanes exist 4 tunnels exist 5 there are land disputes about where the border is that have yet to be resolved
400 mexican and mexican americansborn in the usa i know 4 of them have committed a crime 100 americans i know 30 of them have committed a crime americanswhite black asian people born in the usawhat are the differences in percentage of the peopleif you havehavent figured out the answer in 15 minutesfeel free to get into groups of 2write clearly so the teacher can read your work
future santa fe mayor right there
because a wall is retarded the very least ridonculous idea is not enough 4 u nothing to see here moving on
he is very scientificul haha ha
i have to disagree with you stephen the wall is an enormous waste of money were not china trying to block out the mongolians
x ray scanner wtf lol
the long winded nonmexicana from new mexico is either high or has a speech or mental impediment poor guy and yes i am 2nd gen mexican american im for the wall build it asap lol
the first lady sitting down looks like she has a bottle of water with oleander sprigs in it deadly poison seriously
hes asking people to see the other side of issues omg whatta racist
build the wall and kill anyone trying to illegally get in
what surprises me is how many people hate each other just because they have different political beliefs like is there any possibly thatmaybe theres no right and no wrong  just saying
this guy wants implants insane
notice no crowd they avoided the idiocy
my problem with these is steven obviously does an abundant amount of research before he does these and he is prepared with a rebuttal for basically any argument made against him the people he talk with are people off the street who have had no time to do deep research and prepare for this discussion so there is no way he will have his mind changed because he is way more prepared than the people he discusses with
so was jose cuervo high or drunk  
i gotta call bullshit on the 35 commit 35 of murders thing so illegal immigrants make up 35 of the population weve established that the majority of them are good people if we do the minimum that means 175 of the whole population both came illegally and commit 35 of the homicides the odds of that being accurate are just slim
conservatives solution to problems is to get government to throw more money at the problem how fiscally conservative they are lol
tighter immigration laws and a wall will not stop immigrants from coming to the united states  its the reality their is no wall high enough and their is no law strong enough god made this world and he clearly knows that he didnt make borders in fact the one who made the fence was the same person that stole united states from mexico do not say get over it because millions of people died and you will never get over it god is doing his job giving back the stolen land to its people and if you do not realize that this land was stolen go back to college or really do some reading also i would like to inform you very uneducated people that undocumented people  do not qualify for welfare it is a lie do some research because its the reality they also pay taxes so please remain silent  i would also like to inform you guys that many undocumented people do not commit crimes it is criminals that do the crimes i think its bias to put the crimes next to a certain group lets look at the crimes of school shootings that is right we do not tend to focus on that because it is white people
im less interested in the wall but more prosecuting agribusinesses that hire these people
if you support legal immigration then you support the wall if youre here in the us illegally you need to be legally deported the us spends approximately 150 billion annually on illegal immigrants as a whole
man you did not blur her enought we can see her clothes her bar her hairstyle she will get recognized
the second man is a complete dumbfuck
the more illegals the less legals  considering it costs thousands to do it legally and you have a guaranteed way to tax the legal immigrants and make fairly sure they are good contributing people i dont really see the argument for illegal aliens  i do see the human rights violation against the legal immigrants waiting on years long lists to get ibc of the illegals
mr pass code dude was tripping on speed
illegal immigrants still do taxes
did anyone else notice the girl sitting in the background looks like the same bitch who wanted to bomb their van is that her i need answers lol
the dude is a complete imbecile the proponents of having open borders always contradict themselves as soon as they suggest using any sort of id for those coming across the border whats the use of having any form of id if there are no borders morons
if only adam conover walked by that day
this dude is on some jedi level stupid here i cant even watch all of this
i think what the woman was trying to say was that she supports stronger immigration laws but is just opposed to the actual walland i agree with that an actual wall would be a huge mistake any wall no matter how tall can be scaled so unless you are gonna station guards all across the wall you arent doing anything but if you are gonna do that then you didnt need the wall to begin with
i thought the wall was stupid till all this most recent media hype no one is separated if they either come in legally in any of the dozens of points of entry no kidsjust their own no prison background or leave when they are caught trying to come in illegally if a citizen was bringing in kids as possible trafficking or having their own kids travel alone over hundreds of dangerous miles they would be in prison with all kids taken scotus has already said undocumented can make up a social security number for a job but a citizen cannot seriously reality shows many need to do research xray thru border but no wall
send this  leeroy back to school holy shit hes one big ongoing sentence saying a whole lotta nothing
the last man who spoke described the movie coco  liberal logic this is concerning because i live in new mexico
what surprised you most with this change my mind and what arguments do you most often hear against the wall     1roi it there a return of investment  costs to designbuild maintain will cost taxpayers 100s of billions of dollars with no ability to make up for it2will not stop illegal immigration3wall will initially stop flow but people will find another way4 imminent domain5 environmental dangers to local animal species6 it did not for china or the wall that separated east and west germany7 its childish and lazy way to address the issue8 hurts international relations with our american neighbors9 will strain local armed forces with guarding the wall10 the wall will not lastthese are the reasons i have heard so far  why doesnt the show go to border cities get input from the local law enforcement and communities  after all it affects them directly  i lived in a border city it is my opinion based on what i have observed the wall is just an obstacle not a solution  the argument of securing borders is not valid  securing them from what  poor desperate people an army invasion from mexico that will never come  or preventing terrorists which come oversees
if we had a wall the families wouldnt have a chance to get in so they wouldnt try no arrests no children separated from their parents problem solved
are you high or just incredibly stupid
so how do they find these statistics on illegals
i respect crowders restraint with this one i probably wouldve called the guy on every absurdity he proposed until he realized how insane his words were
that dude has no idea what he is talking about
no you see a wall isnt gonna stop underground tunnels what we need is a mote that way the water falls in and drowns those crossing belowor you know just tighter border control
how autistic must u be to believe a wall across the border is the most cost efficient reliable way to minimise illegal immigration i swear most you red necks dont realise how simple it is to overstay a visa
wall of bullets
so he just sets up randomly and debates whoever wanders over hardly seems fair
this guy is racist 
they need a wall with turrets all around it that shoot lasers like those from the spaceships in the original waroftheworlds  i would gather the number of illegal immigrants would greatly decrease  problem solved
do it at a college campus
lmao the guy was definately on drugs and that camera wasnt even on
the 2nd guy is an idiot
was that guys camera even on lol
oh my that guy wasnt very sharp
this nigga said xray this makes me think this is just fake this guys too much
they should have an xray gate and anyone with a skeleton will have to go through the normal immigration procedures
so this guy is for chipping everyone lol
what the hell is this second guest talking about a scanner that reads their number and why they are coming to the country you cant be serious all the immigrants would still have to legally except your barcode
the way steven looked at the camera at the end was brilliant
wtf xray door that reads your id the fuck kinda drugs is this guy on
i agree with some of your change my mind video ideas but this one is fucking nasty  why dafuq would a person that happened to born in mexico be stopped at a fat wall and not be able to walk on earth  earth is from everybody
the mind change  build my wall
the 2nd guy really kinda made my head hurt when he said that borders are going to be a thing of a past as soon as we do that every thing goes to hell
x ray border bahahahahahahaha
its interesting that he says hes not mexican and that he is spanish since his family has been in mexico since the 1550s all the conquistadors and their families have become mexican nationals if they stayed in the territory now recognized as mexico  he can choose to identify with his espana roots all he wants but whatever country you are  born into becomes your citizenship and one must go through the proper legal procedures to immigrate even though he identifies with spain the hard truth is that spain does not recognize him as one of its own and would not allow him to take up residence there just because of what he feels same goes for the us
yes lets put up miles and miles of xray scanners and make sure everybodies dna gets ionized by radiation top notch idea
good lord these people arent very articulate on changing a mind thank you steven for showing how stupid the average street person truly is
830 i love how the guy just spews things that he thinks should happen but doesnt even think that philosophy of why or is it just or fair need to be addressed its like asking someone what their philosophy on politics is and all they do is read off a wish list free healthcare free housing free food free education its like philosophy is completely missing from their vocabulary
too stupid to have conversation
clearly some cognitive impairment here i think that man may actually be smart but clearly hasnt learned the importance of critical thinking instead of saying hey i didnt think of that when you point out how his plan fails without the wall he instead goes into this insane idea about an xray boarded hopefully he will go home and think about why that wasnt an intelligent thought our next governor of nm ladies and gentleman
build that wall  mine the area between fences  place guard dogs every 50m  plow the area behind it bury motion detectors all along itit will keep anything out
that second guy seemed like a decent man but he acted like he was on some type of drug
i would love to change your mind i just like to argue
wow those people were space cadets especially the last guy he talked about issuing a number and keeping track of people i was like really thats exactly the way its supposed to work now then the wall he did not seem to grasp that there could or would be openings in the wall for people to enter and exit what we really need is a wall up north to keep those damn canadians from getting in and taking jobs from americans i hear one of those canadians has a show where he asks people to change his mind that will never work dumb lol i do find it strange that we have a canadian asking americans these questions you ask them from the point of view and say should we build the wall as if you are including yourself in the we are you an american citizen mr crowder if so i would love to have you love the show bro
i wish someone intelligent could explain to him that when people first started border security on the american mexican border the amount of illegal immigrates exploded because of reduced circular flow if a wall is build it is a proven fact that the number of illegal immigrants will grow a lot larger
most of illegal immigrants come by air around 60 of them therefore building a wall will only stop 40 of them  so building a wall just isnt the best way besides building a wall would cost an incredible amount of money and itd destroy a lot of fauna and flora surrounding the rio grande instead of trying desperately to send them back to their countries we should look for a legal path that works for americans and immigrants
most illegals come by bus train truck and cars90 almost all the drugs come by truck or tunnels the wall will be a great payday for certain companies but will fail miserably at achieving its supposed goal not to mention the orange snowflake could never build this monstrosity it was never going to be built he just wanted idiots to vote for him
wow that kid was really stupid
this is really funny because i live near the border a mexican family lives next door they deal alot of drugs child trafficing they only speak spanish beat their dogs and dont pay taxes they cut hair chop up washing machines and  run a daycare or some bizare attempt to cover all the kids shuffled around they collect welfare and just moved another couple with 4 kids in a 2 bedroom 1 bath house its crazy even if they are legal they live like  donkeys make it so they have to have a gps rifid chip and a 10yr consistent tax paying regime and then they can become mooch citizens they add a 3rd world element to everything
this video needs to be longer
high demand is bad for the economythis causes inflation to risethe standard of living will rise to dreadful rates
leroy is off the shits man
how about yall come up with a solution to stop illegal immigration without a wall that would actually be creative
how is the wall hurtful to people  there are legitimate checkin stations to help bring in legitimate legal citizens  there are ways for them to be legal why is this so hard for them to understand that  yeah there are factors to becoming citizens and are hard but manageable and legitimate  these illegals are not wanting to integrate into american culture  getting rid of ice is not the best liable solution here  and we have a system that does allow foreign people to become citizens  there are many illegals who dont want to be a citizens for reasons
why would anyone think that policy makers take their marching order from citizens if your smuggling anything in a state you need a state official legal and illegal
was this a comedy skit
a product of public schooling
some of the dumbest ideas ive heard yet
lol illegal immigrants paying taxes there is a reason why they are illegal  and it lowkey sucks they are taking our jobs
an xray no mames
on the drug war weve been wasting thousands millions trillions of dollars that escalated quickly
100 of illegal immigrants commit crime in america 100
x ray scanner 
oh my god the guy in the white was painfully dumb and he gets to vote
but the money isnt going back into the economy its going back to their family in mexico how the fuck does that help our economy
a wall will not change the fact we as americans are allowing extreme violence to happen right next door although our military travels the world to stop the same crimes there are definitely dark secrets why the us government hasnt full blown took over mexico
holy fuck what is this guy talking about
lol this guy said that hes not a mexican  he said that hes spanish  he must hate himself indians arent from spain
cringe the school system has failed please interview people with more than one brain cell
this conversation was obviously above the gentlemans capacity
guy in the white shirt is a damn idiot well be able to travel super fast and go anywhere in like 5 years all of his arguments are terrible and i wish i could find his channel guy is scifi as crap scientifical we should make the xray borders more accessible but id have to talk to a bunch of people about this and have 0 info but im gunna be governor of new mexico httpswwwreuterscomfinancestockscompanyprofilegogrpk
leroy is a littlea inarticulate about as convincing as nancy pelosi at a gop rally
dear lord he wants to be a govener
look what happens in the state that is the lowest in education new mexico is a beautiful place with some bad in it
sure you can build a wall which will cost millions in infrastructure money better spent on roadsbridgesetc which will disrupt natural ecological migrations and later be rendered ineffective through overstayed visas underground tunnels and other creative means of transport of course what would make more sense is to excessively fine the farms slaughter houses kitchens etc that draw illegal immigration in the first place if there is no money to be made then it would make sense that the appeal of sneaking across the border would become much less desirable the problem is that this would only end up destroying the bottom line for these businesses who depend on cheap exploitable labor in turn would harm the wealthy faux patriot business owners and shareholders who have bought and paid for the republican party long ago so these men of industry came up with a symbolic gesture in the form of a chant using only monosyllabic words ie build that wall and outlined plans for oversimplified solution the average trump supporter can conceptualize the various government contracts for the jobs will then go to trump supporting contractors see whitefish energy as an example who will see an immediate return on their corrupt and traitorous fealty by massively overcharging the taxpayers while claiming mexico will just reimburse us later spoiler they wont want to start a trade war with mexico to pay for it sure but just remember that when the tariffs go up and the cost of basic materials triples that your average confusedangry trump supporter will probably just find someone else to blame this debate was a farce two guests who are ill informed unprepared and dim witted are not impressing anyone let alone changing their mind
i think the guy in white is on drugs
wow that dude was onsomething gave me tin foil hat vibes gather the mastermindsim personally against the wall and i wouldnt say stricter or more lenient immigration laws but ones that become more lenient for those who would pose less of a threat and stricter for those who have criminal background or we cant really knowi like the idea of a sponsorship program where mexicans or someone from any country can be sponsored by a us citizen that has not committed a felony in their lifetime nor broken the law within the last 10 years after the mexican immigranttobe has visited the country on 3 separate occasions so as to prevent some catfishing of us citizens type deal this of course being limited to a certain number of times prolly just 1 per citizen or granting citizenship to those who have come in on a work visa three times without committing any crimesdude has a point about taxing but your concern is valid im personally for across the board not just for immigrants declining taxfunded programs to people who are not contributing to the tax pool or have a person in the household paying taxes other than employment programs so they at least get a chance to contributemaking it easier for the workers and people our citizens care about on an individual basis to get into the country by extension narrows down the pool of questionable mexican citizens therefore making them easier to sort through individually
its unfortunate that many of the people who sit down and speak with you have literally no idea what they are talking about because there are so many actual arguments and discussions to be had about all of these topics
a no hate speech or no racism change my mind in an hbcu that is still sticking to its roots like morehouse college would be very very interesting
yeah so without borders you dont have a country 
majority of womengirls crossing illegally are raped by those transporting them across  thats a majorityif you are against the wall you are for rape and exploitation
hey steven i just found your channel and im curious to know  are there any episodes where people actually change your mind
open borders  no borders  one world government  change my mind
i thought mexico was going to pay for the wall just one of the thousands of claims from the liar in chief
stevencrowder how the hell are you wearing a long sleeve shirt in texas
what a stupid ass video what the fuck were thinking trying to reason with a potato this guy isnt okay you thought this was good content
people build fences around their own properties but want everyone to enter the country freelythen they need bigger and stronger walls around their propertypeople tend to change the neighborhood they live in in the place theyre coming fromcoming from africa then they bring a part africa with them for example
xray border  what an absolute idiot
if you build a wall can it at least look like some lord of the rings wall if that shit looks like some wall ball court wall ill be mad give me some great wall of china thing going  could make money back by making it a tourist site where people try to catch immigrants in binoculars lol  im mexican btw ill be up there like you got this pedro run holmes run
you didnt seem to want to argue with them cause their dumb the woman seems nice but poorly informed the other seems only dumb and a bit aggressive
this is not the shortest reply how interesting the whole point of mentioning a short reply is because usually youd be related to one no this is a comment about a reply not being short because it has more characters than the one with the least the whole existence of this reply is to tell you that this is not a short reply and as you can see it is not but this brings up the question is this a short reply in todays standards who knows but at least we know that this reply is not short a short reply on this comment would be a couple of words long therefore this is not a short comment and i know that if youve made it this far you clearly have the time to read this not short reply in fact you have so much time that you actually keep on reading and reading and reading and reading and reading and reading and reading and reading and reading and reading and reading and reading and reading and reading and reading and reading and reading and reading and reading and reading and reading and reading and reading and reading and reading and reading and reading and reading and reading and reading the anomaly of you getting the luck of the series of events that happened in your life that allowed you to have time to read this reply the probability of this reply being the lengthiest is now at a high percentage but have you noticed that i too would have had to have the same time to write this what are the odds that we both have this amount of time to readwrite a seemingly pointless reply congratulations you made it through this not short reply 
you were so intellectually beyond that man its embarrassing
lol i can change your mind you pay for it
would u let a criminal in ur house or carhmmm no u wont build the damn wall already if u want to come to america come legally and it will all be ok fuck
secure the border and thats itand build that wall whats mexico going to do about itonly pay billions of dollars which will leave them banked rupt and the anti wall people in the us what are you going to do protest well thats exactly what you guys are going to do because it is the only thing you can do god bless america and im lucky to be here not in a curupt gonverment
leeroy is a special brand of stupid 
theres a reason there wasnt a lot of people participating in the debate everyone is brain washed uneducated by cnn people dont understand that america doesnt run off of feelings its not the taxpayers job to make illegal immigrants lives easy america has been through a lot of wars and progression to get to where its at
does this young man think that if trump said most drugs are coming through the southern border it could be equated with saying most mexicans bring in drugs  probably not truth be damned just stoke the fires  you know americans are really sick and tired with selfish slanderous liars trying to divide us against each other  americans wouldnt be at each others throats if we had more considerate guests who actually cared about contributing to stability on our soil  guests who intentionally try to keep us divided ought to be escorted out like any bad guest that connives to destroy an otherwise good family
that x ray thing feels like the idea of a future where the government has even more control over citizens straight outta a dystopian movie
stevencrowderi dont understand why you endangered that womans life  very cruel and unfair
65000 americans are dying annually due to the invasion of heroine and fentanyl coming from the south  everyone keeps saying these people are coming for a reason  the drug trade is a 6 billionyear industry  pretty good reason eh
do its okay to be white change my mind next
not steven
this guy has watched too many movies
steves look at the end sums it up perfectly d
love these videos
is ok build your own prison just die over that side of the fence and dont ask for support to other countries we dont care
im just saying people want to live good lives had an ok job that gives minimum wage its hard in mexico most people dont have internet and a lot of the recourses the us has but im not i subbing or unliking i just wanted to point that out i didnt watch the whole video so if they do talk about this i wouldnt know
transgenderism is cultural appropriation change my mind
the xray border scanner thing so a fancy futuristic wall instead of a wall that can be actually build today
lets nuke the immigrants like frozen chimichangas
leroy  what a total moron doesnt support a wall but would rather have everybody have big brother chips in their body maybe he should go back to spain there is plenty of housing there in the abandoned cities caused by the poor economy
wtf is the second guy saying i feel bad for the first woman though these illegal aliens are actually harrassing and threatening the actual honest mexicans citizens that came here legally and follow the law those motherfuckers need to goooo
that these people dont understand that illegal immigration on the scale the us is experiencing it  really really hurts the most vulnerable and poor people of a society is mind boggling and i say that as someone who identifies as politically far left
ummm all these people are going to check in without a wall good lord help this guy
i feel like the dude in the white got baffled and didnt want to sound like he gave up on his opinion and said some random bullshit like instead of an normal wall we should get an xray wall that would take much longer to build and be much more expensive
nazis tagged people long before this guy proposed it
some sort of xray wall this man is living in the future boys where we droppin bois we finna pass the x ray wall
he was trying to say a wall wont stop anything  like drugs because there are already pharmaceuticals in america it wont stop trafficking at all he was suggesting keeping tabs on everyone already here making them pay more atleast this way you know who they are its not a good solution but its a better than a wall because a wall wont do anything they can still get over it and around it
should do a police brutality change my mind
a lot of russian bots in this comment section
si viviera en eeuu apoyaria el muro y tambien pondria minas antipersonales en la frontera como hicimos aca en mi pais con los paises vecinoscheers from chile use google translator if you are gringov
mexican women are 100 with the wall just ask them the reasons why they escaped mexicomexico is a shithole
you should not have aired the first lady who knows criminals in her apartment complex  you havent effectively hidden her identity and she has claimed that she wants to inform on these people  you are going to get her killed
im sorry you covered her face but not her badge
as a more moderate liberal i enjoy watching the change my mind segments to challenge my views and see what type of arguments crowler comes up with but i still hardly ever agree i wish he would have conversations with people who knew what they were talking about a bit more most people on the street have no fucking bloody idea whats going on as for this video i wonder where hes getting his statistics httpsenwikipediaorgwikiimmigrationandcrimeunitedstates
x ray dude is insane
love that look at the end
just build the dam wall already having an unsecured border is a dumb idea just look at the spike of crimes in europe i got a great idea to fix the issue1 make the majority of people here legal with green cards and on the path to being citizens yes they do fill some jobs that many dont want to do except when major violent crime is committed they should have that revoked2 make it so a company can be fined for having undocumented immigrants working there same as what great britain does3 build the dam wall and give the border patrol better equipment like drones to watch it4 use some of the tunnel detection equipment that israel uses to find tunnels and destroy them israel knows how to build wallsall this would allow a secured border but still be fair to enter legally having an unsecured border allows easy access to drugs and terrorism into our nation there was a leaked document a few years ago about alquida they wanted to sent people to mexico and they cross into the us as it is easier than getting onto a plane to the us also the cartels in mexico are as violent as isis sometimes and honestly should be combated harder with military force when needed sorry if this sounds hard to some but america is for america first we cant take care of us while trying to take care of everyone else to
god you can tell she is edjumicatedbuild the wall with your assbitchit took her a second pass by to come up with that great linei hope she ends up reading these comments and kills herself after realizing that all the debt she took on to go to collage was in vainshe lost so many brain cells by following the liberal masses and tweeting stupid shit that the best teacher in the world wont be able to teach her how to sit in a chair without falling out of it im dumbfounded that she can even remember how to breathe
that guy is crazy
hahahahaha
excuses excuses
that second interview is a fascinating insight into how a retarded persons mind works
he blew your mind instead of changing it
if that guy really has a show or something it saddens me that people listen to him
lollllllllll electronic id tag bruh
i just think it shouldnt be as hard to get in america thats all im saying
why shouldnt we build a wall because we cant afford it
i watched the whole video and now my brain hurts damn it
touch screen technology came from lsd trips by steve jobs and his mates change my mind
i think that with steven you have to wait and hear everything that he says about the topic because later on it seems that even if he believes in what the opposing party assumes he always is very adamant on telling them that he did not say that
im against the building of the wall but i do like that you go out and challenge other people to change your mind how about getting some professionals in the topic to argue these people cant defend their position right
what the hell is this guy talking about lol
the second dude is legit living in the future
love how that guys solution to the boarder is to build a boarder no no sorry an xray gate
i honestly wonder what would happen if a modern liberal met a nazi flip out or hug them
that guy in white is so stupid he said they should be aloud to come in because they give us tax money they dont pay taxes thats why they didnt come legally
she said how do i deport i mean report those people she meant deport 
we have enough mexicans central americans chinese here in la too many theres no room to move
the wall is just a metaphor  as this video demonstrates no one can talk about the wall without going directly  to the immigration debate  the two need to be separated as no matter where you stand on immigration or any of the underlying issues sanctuary cities visa lotteries travel bans acceptance of refugees etc a critical analysis of the wall can only conclude that it is a project that takes up far too much resources and time for the very little in security that we would get in return  if you say im for the wall as a way of saying i am for tougher enforcement of current immigration laws newer and more restrictive laws for legal immigration and better security at the border then you have reasonable positions with which other reasonable people can agree or disagree especially in the details  this is where the immigration debate can be constructive  but if you say im for the wall as a way of saying we need a continuous structure along our border with mexico then youre just a moron
that second guy is so confusing to comprehend he came so illprepared lol
the wall is a stupid idea the vast amount of resources it would take to build this gigantic structure would be staggering we dont have the budget to have adequate amount of school supplies in our classrooms and somehow we can just procure the materials labor and time to build a 2000 mile wall what is conservative about that much of the land there is private property is the government going to seize it in the name of eminent domain that seems like it would be the biggest abuse of government power since the internment camps and goes highly against the rights stance of small government walls have been notoriously poor throughout history at keeping people out from genghis khan breaching the great wall of china multiple times at different points to the nazis completely bypassing the maginot line to the thousands of east germans crossing the berlin wall to the thousands of north koreans getting through the dmz every year and thats just off the top of my head a project of this magnitude and cost better stop all illegal entry coming in from mexico but youd be foolish to think it would also dont a large chunk of illegal immigrants do so by plane
jesus i hope that woman is ok you could still see her face on the badge she was wearing s also how high was that first dude been playing too much deus ex or something
wowi actually feel bad for that guy he seems nice enough but he is not a high intellectual thinker
how many biker gangs in america are doing crimes that are not documented
politicians are bringing most of the drugs in this country
bc of this video and you will get her killed your dumb for posting this video
im from mxico and i can tell you that the wall wont stop illegal inmigration the families that are scaping to usa do it because they are looking for better economic oportunnities for their families due to corruption the goverment is taking away land from the people a lot of them doesnt have access to water education or well paid jobs the poor people is being exploited so the goverment is the one to blame for but dont say stuff like inmigrants are stealing our jobs because im more than sure  that you wont like to work 8h under the sun for 4 dlls per hour also are you really  dumb enough to believe that the drugs are being bring to the us illegaly the cartels use trailers to transport tons of drugs and they do it through the border how well you also have corruption on your side theres a lot to work to do for both countries but i can tell you that a wall wont stop anything   p s im sorry for my english
leroy  lol bro wtf
omfg how many people just talk out of their asses when they talk to stephen all of a sudden people have the solutions and the great ideas as to what to do that dude about the electronic tags makes no fucking sense yes that would be a great idea but how would you get them to funnel to that electric monitor without a wall and please for the love of god stay on fucking topic no one cares about you being the governor of new mexico jesus christ
pee is stored in the balls    change my mind
rip x
this was painful to watch
trump did say there bringing in drugs what are you on he also said these people from sht hole countrys are coming here so he is a huge trash talker and jails have walls  drugs still get in so a wall not the answer also nobody will change your mind your in the conservative mind set of keeping things simple and law and order thats how republicans brains work there is no right or wrong answer wen your a dem or repub you just want what you think is best for america because at the end of the day we all want most of us want america to be chill and fun but to have laws and rules but bashing people for there beliefs is not going to get that peace we all want in america and outside america you cant make america great again because it was never better than what it is now because if you look back to the 80s and stuff wen was america great it mite of ben for a week better than it is now but make america great again makes zero sense to me
wow that guy future governor of  new mexico was a laughable dunce electronic tagging so he thinks we should tag the ear of all illegal immigrants just like theyre chattle yeah thats gonna go over really well with the raceobsessed crowd who want to draw comparisons to slavery at every turn
yeah go ahead build it and let all the tax payers pay for it lets just make one thing clear here not all immigrants crossing are mexicans you have all central americans crossing through mexico pretending to be mexicans secondly from all the people here trying to become citizens mexicans are more likely to get denied people from any other country have more chances to become citizens than anybody else food for thought you would never end this immigration shit
so do doesnt want there to be a physical border but hes okay with microchipping individuals and tracking their movements inside every leftist is a little tyrant just waiting to get out
fuck that new mexican dude is retarded
where can i get some of that scientifical ray
build the wall with your ass bitch
how do i report those people 
most people are uneducated idiots  change my mind
deport all blacks
you cant argue with stupid the only way to shut liberals up is asking them to donate and pay from their own pockets directly without fail they change their minds
you want to know why you shouldnt build the wall well heres some facts first its going to cost millions and millions of dollars and as you may know america has a huge debt 1815 trillion facts thats one side of it you should be focusing on trying to spend that money in other services and providing a better education and health care in the united states to increase qualifications and through better qualifications create better jobs for people this way the revenue annual would be bigger second point is people are going to get in anyways the wall is just a stupid and another dumb trump idea with no good justification what so ever and last but not least the wall would take ages years and years to be built and the united states government right now should try and find a solution for the money problem right now stop focusing on the outside if the system is fucked on the inside
veganism is doing more harm than good change my mind
deport all illegals
i bet every mexican in the usa knows at least 3 people who are aliens  if not more because his reply to having a wall was pretty much making fun of the idea of keep these mexicans under control
that dude does not represent new mexico wow
if only he could find a couple of masterminds
lol living in california you know how many mexicans  i have met zero theyre all from el salvador equador spain no lisp brazil not a word of the portugeuse you name it its hilarious  but i love it and i love them these spaniards know how to make a tasty bean burrito though
wow that second person was not christian for sure but also incredibly naive  how do you get illegals processed if they dont come through a checkpoint  xray lmfao the product of a flawed educational system  perfect for new mexico
i really dont think this guy understands the statistics i think what you needed to do here was to illustrate it with a graph
that was not fair to publish this video with that guy in it showing such an extremely low level of intelligence
i think this videos are really interesting and i can agree or disagree on some matters but sometimes even good discussions need to come down on numbers and having good statistics and the ability to interpret them could improve dramatically  the sit downs having the numbers and the articles on hand on paper or on a tablet could be richer than saying  it is wrong statistics say otherwise  show rather than tell
like im not european my family is actually african because in the 1550s bc they started traveling north so you know im totally african
do a earth is round
steven you should have asked the last guy just simply what about people who dont want to go through these checkpoints to be tagged
building that wall to stop illegal immigration is like making gun laws to stop gun violence
low iq very concerning they arent sending their best folks
build the wall thats it borders work if your house has borders and you can decide who comes and goes into your house its exactly the same again build the wall
the guy in the white shirt from new mexico hurt my brain so much and its even more embarrassing that hes filming the whole thing himself and hes going to willingly show people that nonsense thats coming out of his mouth and post it on social media like its a good thing he actually said i have to get together with some masterminds i know xray border machines
steves look at the end is how i was watching this video all the way thru except the part he mentions being governor i couldnt help but break face and start laughing at my phone props to being professional and not calling this guy a complete imbecile and nodding your head as he spits this futuristic unbelievable x ray program guys got an imagination ill give him that
man that mexican was so outoftouch with reality  
that second guy is so dumb
a boarder wall is an infrastructure solution to a human problem the true way a boarder wall will be funded is future reduction in government paid services like police or ice
dude that lady in the beginning kinda sounded crazy like not to be mean but she sounds like if she is off her mess or sum from personal experience i believe this
we must build this so called electrical field nobody gets in nobody gays out
its a wall a literal none harmful wall
a lot illegals are very low iq and intelligence you can tell from this video x ray wall nice idea mexican
lmao tax the dumb poor dirty immigrants what a job hell i would be happy to get them out of our safety nets
against a wall but wants to put a chip in every human to track them somehow im not even surprised
im for trump let the hate roll in 
this dude is all over the placehes describing a dystopia
wow that poor guy in the white shirt really had no freakin idea what he was talking about
someone actually turned me on to crowder last week arguing with me on a ben shapiro video comment segment i expressed my dislike of trevor noah and samantha bee and they suggested i must be a crowder fan and meant it as an insult and now i am hooked how ironic more proof of leftists destroying their cause lmao mug club coming soon
that guy is a retard
build a physical wall or an xray wall its still a wall just because you cant see it doesnt change the fact that its acting as a wall so in the end he did agree to some extent with your view im just interested in knowing how much it will cost to build the xray vs the physical
the lady sounds like my older relatives when they talk about the news
i agree with you on previous videos in this series such as gun control and abortion but this is one i simply cant stand behind
507 im not mexican im spanish my family has been in new mexico since 1550s ok first off spanish isnt a ethnicity its a language 2nd sorry to break it to you but you are mexican3rd 1550s  really 
i love this series so much although there are a few topics i disagree with you on its really interesting listening to genuine and peaceful conversations between such polarised views you dont see that very often these days thank you
please do a feminism is not about equality change my mind i think feminism is about bringing up women and putting down men
i would like to ask this  islam doesnt work in the west  i know some snow flakes wont like it but if you research the religion as a whole it is uncompatable it also goes against the mass views of the people
why are mexicans so low iq listening to them gives me a headache they speak and reason like kindergarteners
build the wall with your ass bitchway to go kid genius
mr crowder i think i  could present you w info that would have u changing ur mindon the wallgov rick perry showed us how its done wen he instituted the texas  border  watch programstrategically placed cameras where people at home could monitor the border and alert response teams my point is mr crowder and friendsthat it worked  appears to have worked too well possibly cause it was defunded  there are risks associated with a wall ok so trump builds a crazy wall and then the nwo kill him and release dhs and their m raps on society good fucking luck escaping through a trump wallits dangerous it could become recorded histories biggest tomb the usa could its reckless and irresponsible to build it wen maybe all we  need is actual enforcement maybe all we need is to adopt a virtual  border watch like perry did in texas let  the people and malitias  monitor our own fucking border  yah korea has a wall guess wat happens if ur caught trying to climb it mr crowder wat if the  border watch cameras fall into enemy hands who caresa lot different then a trump wall getting into enemy hands
get a white tape for the sign please
pick some non retarded people next time this is a waste of time
it scares me how people actually want open boarders
i think it would be pretty cool if links to these stats were posted in the description not that i doubt them but honestly i would like to see for myself of course i could always just educate myself just constructive feedback
before it used to be the blacks that used to commit the most crimes now its all hispanics so i say out of 100 i would say 75 of hispanics are committing crimes
i feel sometimes that trying to share the truth with anybody is useless as they will always dig their heels in and resist the truth
that guy is awfully idealistic he really didnt know where he was going with his ideas
that dumb spic should just invent the technology he needs to make his system work lol
crowder your f ing numbers are a bunch of bs where are you getting your statistics from bro you may try and talk proper but you aint no intellect the proof is in the puddin get your facts straight you let me down son you sounding like a simpleton with yo trump agenda mindset look this up confirmation bias
i love your dog btw
use the money on something a lot more effective and less archaic its the 21st century
that fact about undocumented immigrants being 37 of murderous crimes is factually incorrect theyre more likely to not commit a crime because of the threat that they will be deported or ruin the chance of hope that they hold dear its simple logic
numbers are all over the place here but a quick google search says hes looking for 18 billion for a wall then dhs says 22b and nyt says 70b
why a wall though i agree with so much of what you said but the wall is such an idiotic idea
do is god real change my mind
you know damn well crowder is thinking this is a dumb mother fucker at least i am
maybe like an xray like i dont know the exact like im not like a super mind expert but like at the same time like maybe so like maybe
i never went to college these interviewees make me feel like i could be a rocket scientist
xray border xd
is a border wall going to 100 completely stopp immigration in its tracks what is the price to build a huge border wall who is going to pay for the border wall and if its not going to be the american citizens how are we going to make someone else pay for the border wall
that guy is such an idiot xray scanner so instead of a cheaper wall a more expensive digital wall what a retard for a guy who claimed to have been thinking about it for three years he really hasnt thought it through at all just because trump is doing it doesnt mean you have to automatically disagree
this guy is talking some new world order dystopian shit
thank god for donald j trump these people are soo brainwashed
that last guy is high
you need to debate with someone who has actually live the life and really struggled with that life
one of my old coworkers was born in the us moved to mexico at the age of 3 with his dad at 19 he went to go apply for a job got deported back to america and lives with his mom i asked him about it and he said that he misses mexico and wants to go back
lol theres a magical thing called planes and tunnels the wall is only for retards to support
i generally enjoy your show but your crime stats are ridiculous and i graduated with a criminology degree  youve mentioned the burden of proof in other videos with what you stated about murder and drug sales the burden of proof is now on yousecondly you love to talk about who brings in and sells the drugs  i have a question who is buying the drugs
that guy sounds like a fucking moron just like a muckum a pasta putestema
imagine that the spanish kid wants no borderswhoda thunk
why want the wall that cost billions of dollars instead invest that money to help people that need it and the wall wouldnt stop crimes from happening in and out of the country and people who crossed the border who happens to be good or bad people theres bad in everyone no matter what  think all the shootings done in the us done by different race u see different race
lol a few mastermind individuals to figure this out yeah maaaaaaaaaan we just tag em maaaaaaaaaaan maybe we can have them were some kind of symbol so they are more easily identified wait a second this sounds like a slippery slope rofl love your videos
we dont need a wall we need an xray scanner
drugsuh passuh drugsuhuh uh uh very well spoken young man there
dude in the white is so clueless and it honestly pisses me off  like quit talking my guy you dont have any clue on what the hell youre discussing gtfo
build that fucking wall today and deport every fucking last one of these illegals and their anchor kids
can someone tell me how a wall is supposed to stop cartels from crossing the borderi mean whats this wall going to be made of have we discovered some crazy cheap material that cant be blown up lolnot to mention they can also tunnel under the wall
how would building a wall stop immigration where would you put the wall around your house
you should make a change my mind on cultural appropriation tired of people discriminating each other because  oh youre not allowed to wear this because my culture thinks its not racist or discriminating to tell a person of different culture that they cant wear or do something because of their color
i think the guy from new mexico was high
as a new mexican i hope he doesnt win the governors office
wish i could meet you would love to sit with you and discuss everything appropriately i agree with everything youve said love these videos
what concerns me about the argument about the wall is that mostly liberals will say its a stupid idea without even providing a single idea as an alternative in fact the only alternative ive heard is build bridges not walls which is the absolute dumbest fucking idea ive ever heard we can talk all day about why an idea wont work but thats not very productive at all i want to hear alternatives
is this the statistic that you gave httpswwwsnopescomfactcheckhaveundocumentedkilled63000us911
you can be against illegal immigration and against the wall as well like use that money instead to pay for more border patrol so they dont get bribed from smugglers just a thought
oh so this is a concept for a show this guy doesnt actually stand behind some of these things
the lady is mentaly ill
mexicans are nice 
do a topic on space force people are getting heated over that
you should try this one somewhere else and see what you get
great video as always i would really like to see sources for the facts so i can use them when people tell me the wall isnt a good idea
xray boarder so you can be tract  not too orwellian hahahaha
1010 jim halpert at the end
this guys gonna be the governmenor of new mexico shiet im moving there and slingshot into 2183472 ad
the dude in the white shirt is a major douche he was just on the show to fucking film himself didnt know what he was talking about
holy shit i lost brain cells watching the mexican dude
no wall because its too expensive and it wont even slow down immigration legal or otherwise its a 4th century solution to a 21st century problem anyone can get over a wall with a ladder rope or tunnel lets look at solutions that fit our time and economic reality
i dont agree that selling or buying drugs is moraly wrong
the jerk in white shirt is really stupid many illegals have zero documentation in their own country and how are we supposed to check them out moron
problem  too many illegals here refuse to learn english thus they cant obey laws they dont now the illegals cant pass food handlers permit cant pass drives license teston and on and on
listen  the purpose of the wall isnt to stop 100 of the illegals it it to lessen the amount of illegals coming here it is the liberal dumbasses that keep stating the wall isnt going to stop 100 coming here illegally
the second guy was a complete idiot unable to form a single coherent thought lol build the wall trump 2020
the guy in the white t shirt is delusional
can you do this one again it needs more angry blue haired people
i just think the wall is an ineffective solution not only will they find ways around it but you cant build it right on the border we have to take land from a lot of our citizens and ruin their lives for said ineffective solution the wall literally gives land to mexico land that belonged to private citizens i want a solution but one that works and is less destructive to our own citizens lives
you should do im pronuclear change my mind
plot twist the wall is to keep us in not to keep others out trying to push gun control too connect the dots anyways good intentions or not i dont think a wall will work the way people are hoping it will but hell maybe the desert will finally get some shade 
so this mfr crowder is from canadago back to your country crowder
and what would that xray machine be attached tomaybea wall
we dont need no deportationwe dont need no xenophobeshey trump leave mexico alone
although the second guys ideas were all pretty rubbish at least he didnt sit down without any ideas at all and just stand and scream racist every time steven said he didnt agree
lmao is he really proposing a catch tag and release program for humans
past tense of yeet is yoot change my mind
theres a pretty good segment by john oliver about a potential border wall httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvu8dcyocuyit715s  in a nutshell its extremely expensive to build and maintain and will not effectively keep out illegal immigrants anyways because they will simply build tunnels use ladders or do what almost half of them do already enter the country legally and then overstay their visas
i think i lost a lot of brain cells listening to the guy in the white tshirt
i dont think we should build the wall i think we should jail employers who hire illegal immigrants  real jail time maybe 1 year per violation
god help new mexico
they should make it easier and faster to get a visa instead of a rediculous long wait for the american mexican border but it should also be very effective
both of these idiots didnt make an sense
this spanish dude is high
so hes against trumps wall but wants a 2000 mile xray border lmao
most illegal immigrants come to america by plane and overstay their visas building a wall will do nothing to help that and is a waste of time and money and makes us look like idiots
i like that guy with the podcast with the backpack and the white shirt or whatever he was hilarious
this guy is fucking dumb
closed captions at 425 lmao love crowder but essentially this whole segment in a nutshell
can we hear more from the guy with the white tshirt  real genius
omfg that look at the end xd lmao
the spanish dude is a little spastic and misinformed  he glazed over crowders statistics
how about this anyone that doesnt want the wall has to remove the walls from their house anyone who doesnt want a border can remove the fence or door off their house why not since youre so trustworthy and to anyone who wants to cut out immigration tell your military government to stay out of other countries creating chaos tell your government you dont want corrupt american policies in foreign countries stop false wars created by propaganda that benefit cooperate globalists its annoying to see all these zombies who only get mad when the news tells you to bunch of mindless drones maybe figure out what lead up to all these people fleeing to the border do some research and look at how your government and globalist elites has ravage third world countries
welp there goes crowder making up statistics again how you supposed to change someones mind who operates on a different set of facts than reality
you americans really know nothing you dont know the cartels the drugs will be getting to the us no matter how tall your wall is you are doing this just as a xenophobic monument and is not going to do shit to solve your problems handle your own shit and dont blame us in the south who always have been friendly to you
everyone is allowed to express them selfs but if its against me ill bash you that is the mentality of most americans
yall realize you can dig a tunnel right
i cant believe that guy stole my xray wall idea damn it
why did the dude in the white keep putting an a at the end of his words he sounded like he was trying to do a cheap italian accenthe was cool though lol
was this tent and table setup outside of a mental health facility where do you find these people steven then again i dont get out enough maybe the majority of people do actually think like this thats a scary thought
i lost brain cells listening to the second guy
scientifical xray border and leroy was eager to challenge the conversation
i agree with you on most things but the wall is a huge waste of money its not going to stop them from coming in i whole heartily disapprove of illegals coming in but a wall is just silly
sosteven where did you get the 35 of illegals committing 3740 of all murders in uslolif illegals commit 37 of all the murders then blacks only commit 10 and not to mention millions of the latinos and the other races who are legalwhich one is ityou cant have it both ways
according to every police source almost 50 of all murders are committed by the whites who make up more than 65 of the us populationfollowed very closely by the blacks who only make up 12 of the us populationso blacks commit way more crimes than any other race compared to their population
so let anyone come in as long as they have a tag in their body to track them and make them pay taxesthats solid immigration planning right there just no doubts about itwe are fucked
the constitution is not a living document  change my mind  maybe too broad but could be good
dude just say no
my only criticism would be that for such a great topic it was wasted on an idiot talking about all that futuristic garbage and expecting things to work without any idea how etc i wanted to really hear change my mind on building the wall
secure the border a wall is a retarded idea
please go to the flat earth convention and do a the earth is round change my mind
the thing about a wall that people dont seem to understand its very simple you can fly over a wall you can dig under a wall or you can go around a wall i know it seems like a wall wouldnt do much after realizing that it will just make some ignorant people feel better
white shirt dude for new mexico governor
as soon as people present valid facts they start getting all defensive why cant americans just respect our government or get the f out if its so bad here
future governor of new mexico right there
and  405  leroy aka seor taco loco lost grip of reality
well i guess id rather spend my tax money on reforming the schools rather than keeping people who need to escape a deteriorating country from getting into a more positive one but that might just be me
it would cost billions and billions of dollars to build that wall just hire more people to guard it with that money and create more jobs that way the wall wont do shit youd still have money left over afterwards and then you can use that money on more important issues like refining our public school systems
cost efficiency economic studies have shown stricter border controls have slowed incoming immigrants but have bottlenecked people leaving creating a growth of illegals staying  instead of the pattern of seasonal migration that occurred in the past
everify for all job applicants with serious sanctions for delinquent employers
they dont want to be legal citizens thats the problem lmao
if ppl come in illegally they arent paying taxes
422 cause we might find some areas where we disagree versus areas where we disagree politics in a nutshell folks
i cant wait until my mans is the governor of this fine city of new mexico 
gawd that mexicanspanish dude was seriously dumb
scary and funny at the same time
israel should take refugees into their country crowder is a jew tool
lord help us
i believe this problem would go down if the process of legally obtaining citizenship or legally coming to the us would be made more simple it has been made too difficult which is why these people take the more difficult and unwanted route this is my thought change my mind
so he thinks people should be taggedlike cattletells me what he thinks of humans
the sad thing is that in my great state of new mexico most of the people are about this uninformed about everything you get in a conversation about issues like this and everyone has an emotion about the subject but no one has a real argument
you have said in the past that you respond to every negative comment so fuck you and your stupid hair stephen now that that i have fulfilled my legal obligation of my comment needing to be negative in order to meet the prerequisites for a response i would love to see an honesty is more important than civility change my mind more accurately in the course of debate it is not important that dont offend you if what i am saying is true not being rude and yelling someone down because you think they are wrong
a fuckin xray gate  lmfao
why have a wall when you can get one of those big lasers from resident evil
stick with immigration laws screen allow immigrants who will contribute to the us and pay taxes without burdening our system a chance the wall i can assure you is necessary thinking otherwise is ignorant
this guy has dreams
crowder is awful at this job somebody else should take over this segment i think this change my mind could be a huge success he comes in hot trying to start arguments because he wants this to be good but he is a poor debater look this should be either funny or authentically educational hes not the man for either job
omfg build the wall regardless of cost and do it fast then deport these thick cunts before your country is written off
steven is twice my age but hes so cute xd
is there a source on the figure around the 630 mark that 35 of undocumented immigrants make up for 37 of the uss homicides
the face at the endhaha
track where people are everywhere like knowing that people are in countrys is something but if it goes as close as knowing if people are in citys that just some real dystopian shit well google and facebook are already doing that but still my phone is not part of my body for now
can we get a link for where your getting your information from at 653 please
i am prosuicide if someone wants to end their life and if its a permanent issue we should let them die without pain such as a pill if you agree you should make a im prosuicide  change my mind
americans be like build the wallmexicans be like we got tunnels puto
i got a change my mind ad on a change my mind video
that other talk show host is insane
god help new mexico if that guy gets elected
was this video filmed in santa fe new mexico
on the second guys plan to make an xray border if you were to make open borders where people had to identify themselves people who arent trying to hide anything would go through those points and identify themselves why would they try to make a dangerous hike across a desert then it would be only criminals that would try to sneak across at a place that isnt a checkpoint
i would love to see a god is real change my mind
the constitution doesnt give congress the power to regulate immigration the founding fathers gave us open borders the borders were completely open until the chinese exclusion act of 1882 capitalism requires the free movement of goods and people
i think the wall would be a ridiculous waste of money i think a better solution would be reforming the immigration process the current immigration process is entirely too lengthy and expensive so what i would suggest is to shorten the immigration process to no more than 3 months shouldnt take longer than that to vet people use much less money than it would take to build the wall and build facilities to house those immigrants and their immediate family members that are seeking asylum from actual danger in their country for a that 3 month period all other not threatened immigrants can simply wait in their country until their immigration is approved we avoid the huge cost of the wall we avoid seperating families and we avoid most illegal immigration if i had to wait years and years and years to enter a country legally i would probably try the illegal route as well i am not okay with illegal immigration but i also understand that our immigration process and policies probably contribute to it quite a bit
that guy is an idiot and has no argument
an xray boarder hahaha
my man is writing an episode of stargate sg1
the thing i find dumb with the wall is the fact that i dont think mexico will actually pay for the wall and instead come out of our own pockets for the dumb wall and if im not mistaken the wall will cost billions or maybe millions but i either way one country mexico shouldnt be forced to pay for it themselves when immigrants can come from anywhere
wtf  that guy is crazy  x ray border   lmao   oh yeah  governor of new mexico  wow this guy is off his meds 
hi mmuh names jeffi am a cheap prick
also many immigrants admit to sending money to their relatives back in their home countries many of them retire back to their home countries literally sending american dollars in checks to their countries also many arabs and indians send large amounts of money to their home country specifically to invigorate their economies back home in their country and bleed our economy
446 we already have citizens to spend money within our economies we already have that covered thank you very much like wtf
build a wall only if its full proof why waste our money on something that doesnt work look at the great wall of china so many people got through that and its the largest in the worldwe cant build thati am for deporting those who are not legally here and causing problems this means they arent paying taxes and are nearly untraceable if they commit a crimestart with those that are dealing in drugs and stealing feeding the mexican pipeline of drugs to this countrys youth later make a thorough sweep for other illegals still hereif the child was born here let them make the decision to stay or go to mexico if the child is not old enough to decide whether they want to stay in the us they and their parents will have to move back to mexico and apply for citizenship this gives the parents time to apply for citizenship here gain some money for the move back and make sure their children are stable this will also deter those who really do not care to stay in the uswe have to have humanity and we see a whole other country adoring ours because we are the land of the free if these people want in let them in accordingly you might have the next einstein coming in our gates let it happenbuilding smaller groups of walls will be easier to guard stronger in force and effective if bumped with more guards and prevention measures such as filling tunnels
an xray border huh havent heard that one yet lmao and to think he actually thinks hes smart enough to run for a office of higher power were all fucked
electronic tags we aint prisoners if im legally in a country i should have the freedom to go about my day without being watched like a hawk
wow had no idea on those stats i supported the wall before now i dont know why nothing is being done and shocked it wasnt proposed before trump
was that last guy stoned
im not for building a wall im for building a fence that lets people know when they are crossing the border as some people even do it accidentally and it is extremely common for canadian citizens who live near the border to accidentally cross i dont believe a wall would do anything to actually help stop illegal immigration you can go around the wall you can fly over it you can use a ladder i mean there is a reason the great wall of china is no more than a historical site today and not an actual deterrent to crossing their borders its because this isnt the stone age anymore and spending millions of dollars on something that wont actually work is just dumb
attack helicopter is a real gender change my mind
i think we should have a wall in the north as well due to canadas muslim migrant policy
where are your sources for your facts dude
if mexico and central american countries werent such a mess you wouldnt need to discuss the ridiculous idea of spending billions of dollars on a physical wall maybe the us and canada should be discussing what they can do to help bring stability and prosperity to these countries that people want out ofshort term a wall might sound good but long term the logical solution would be to work on a cure instead of a bandaid
why build a wall when a gun would work much better
i have written my note to verify i will be a willing participant of the usas economy and promise not to sell drugs or commit crime who do i send it to
the governor of new mexico  can people really be that dumb or was he joking
i would really like the source on his stats
build the wall
so that guy is basically describing what already exists which is going through the process of becoming a citizen the difference is that he supports the idea that no one could be rejected
xray wall isnt a half bad idea in all honesty dont change my mind
the wall is just a big waste of money yes the border should be secure yes we should reduce illegal immigration what i have a problem with is a wall isnt gonna slow down illegal immigration because look at cuba they cross a pretty large body of water to get to states like florida you spend money on this wall and those people are gonna go around it over it under it so we are gonna spend what 25 billion on a wall thats gonna take no effect then how are we going to pay for that mexico isnt paying for it the rich got their perminant tax cuts so all of those taxes are going to fall on our backs not only will we lose our tax cuts in a few years but it will go even higher because of that stupid wall there are other ways to secure that border that wont waste 25 billion dollars
idc how old this is but fuck his opinion and anybody that agrees with him
a wall just seems too over the top and just wrong
i know santa fe is retarded but theres no way hes getting elected anything
the second guy was kinda dull
wtf i feel dumb as fuck listening to this dude steven idk how you kept your calm
i think boarders should be illegal they are just imaginary lines drawn on paper we all all of the human race and citizens of planet earth and untill we see that we will never have peace
 shes for illegal immigration
california is now owned and populated by latinos
are all latinos stupid like this guy
this could be me being really super ignorant but why dont why remove the income tax entirely and increase taxes on our purchases that way the whole concept of not wanting to be a legal citizen because you have to pay taxes becomes irrelevant   if i am completely wrong here just let me know
this guy is exactly how i imagine the common man thinks
funny stuff this guy talks fast and has some funny ideas pulled straight out of movies but he clearly has never even thought about the basics like resource allocation or budgeting
veganism is a myth change my mind
so sad that there are people that stupidclueless out there thx for giving them a mic crowder i dont mean to be sarcastic because it shows the reality of what is out there
electric id tag lol
this guy is just throwing out words that just make no sense
its funny how the dumbest people always have so much to say lol that dude needs to lay off tha coca leaf lol he s not making any sense formulating his ideas
haha your statistics make me laugh
1030 dude goes full on minority report with scanners around cities scanning everyone all the time wtf
where the fuck did this moron get his statistics let me guess faux news build another mayflower and sail your pale asses back to europe fucking white trash need to go back to that shit hole called europe 
lmfaooo xray border lmfaooo
the 2nd guy is way off the wall he lost me
blurring her face may not protect her please understand that the people who she maybe talking about could off someone without thought what you are doing is right legal etc etc but could lead to horrible consequences just saying
ive smoked 4 bowls and i still have a headache from this guy
my human geography teacher talked to me about immigration one time during my free time and we discussed how legal mexican immigrants actually despise illegal ones more than white conservatives because they had to work so hard to get citizenship and then these illegals just cross the boarder for free and get handed everything for free and dont have to pay taxes
im surprised so many people want to publicize their lack of intelligence and education on camera
can u please cite the sources so i can use these statistics
go ahead build a wall itll help with the immigration problem but forcing mexico to pay for it seems like a pipe dream  you want someone to come into your house by letting them in through your front door and not sneaking in through your back door right well you cant rely on a dude whos willing to sneak into your shit to pay for a fence to keep them out do it yourself
what was up with that last shot1313
i had to stop listening to the guy in the white shirt  it was painful
i hear most often that most illegal immagrants come here legally and overstay there visas and that a good percentage of them fly so the point of a wall must be useless otherwise i hear arguments stating that it will cost billions of dollars and that it would be way better to put a system in place that would prevent illegal immigrants from being able to over stay there visas and then use the money instead for things like renewable energy
what will happen if the people refuse to show up to the classes refuse citizenship refuse to pay taxes what are the consequences
i dont understand why there isnt a greater emphasis on the cartels in this issue all illegal immigration is through them and is a large source of income for them in order to get from south or central america into the us illegally you need to pay the cartels and they smuggle you across and once in the us they again find you for the rest of the money if you try to get in to the us illegally without being escorted by a cartel handler cartel gunmen will shoot you those bastards often send these people on a 4 day walk through the desert after telling them it is only 4 hours and many run out of water and die el paso morgue is full of people who died of thirst its likely cartel members that the lady at the beginning was afraid of these bastards are well funded well armed and vicious and this problem cant be fixed if they are ignored
and lets make it clear its not just hidpanics and latins coming in through the border we have caught wanted terrorists from the middle east coming in through the mexican border
change my mind sucks horribly you have a guy who prepares all the republican talking points on issues and basically debates the worst representatives of the nonright you can find basically far from the  most intellectual or stable people who go in completely unprepared its like freestyle battling random people on the spot when you have all your punchlines ready
steven crowder is a christian therefore hes an idiotthe other guys intelligence however cannot be properly described using the english language he must be a result of inbreeding or something of that nature hes about as smart as a christian on steroids
we need xray borders everytime an immigrant crosses it they get cancer
about 90 of all heroin and meth crosses the southern border and now mexicans are bringing what is called mexican super meth
this guy hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
tax illegal immigrants resulting in more welfare programs
rip that first lady
build a wall on both borders so that they cant say its racists but they still will
lets see a video where you take an l too many wins
that guy is stupid
i seriously cannot understand why these people would even sit down without a valid argument it completely blows my mind how ignorant all of these volunteers are not just in this video but in all of your interviews we need a wall period i wish we could have a wall around the entire perimeter of the country maybe that would not only solve the illegal immigration issues but also help us dedicated us citizens realize how detrimental having all of these non us citizens clogging up our prisons streets and schools its truly sad that 34 of the undocumented illegal population contributes to 37 of the national homicide rate i dont see why it is so difficult for people to recognize that this is an issue and a danger not only for yourself and your children but for the future of out beautiful nation
944 liberals    the wingin it political party 
812 they invented that already its called legal immigration
pathetic how the low iq inbreds have to resort towards shouting obscenities instead of coming up with refutationslow iq  more likely to using violence against strangers
my god these young adults future of america can barely phucking formulate a proper english sentence wtfwtfwtf my 7 year old neice can speak more proper and is more articulate then these college studentsare we really this phucked up my god did that idiot  ah um oh u ah um spanish guy really say an xray borderyeahno yeah we are doomed unless there is a miracle some divine intervention we are in very real and very serious trouble these folks cant be trusted with a constitution cant be trusted with a democracy or any of the 3 branches of government they will ruin everything it took to get us this far im a legal immigrant and i bleed red white and blue build the wall amd build it tall and teach our kids english again we dont need spanish as a second language when our youth cant even formulate a basic argumentative sentence without looking like their brains are about to implode inside their half empty skulls they literally speak how they text message and have the iq of a lap dog we dont fix this we are finished
you have no idea what youre talking about leeroy lmao let me take a hit of whatever it is youre smoking lol
lol that look at the end though
that guy tried to hard to sound like an intellectual on the subject and just ended looking like a fool with his three  years of brainstorming ideas lol
lmaoooo steven crowders facial reaction after the guy walked away im so dead 
did this guy just say hes gonna be a governor hahahaha hes a fucking retard i dont want a wall but everyone should go through checkpoints with documentation no fucking shit what stops them from walking the fuck aarroouunndd the checkpoint oh right a god damn wall
please do mass muslim immigration in europe is bad
the wall is not like the wall of china this wall is reinforcement of the borders fixing borderless areas low securityhigh illegal immigrant entry locations
this dude is clearly not all there and obviously not super bright whats the value in a conversation with a guy like this
build that wall
im a white  new mexico resident but i absolutely do not not that cunt as my governor hes a fricking idiot
im gonna give props where props are do you got balls crowder
any chance of a segment on the settlement of palestine
i could have spit out my drink when he said i would need some masterminds  i dont know why that was so funny
fight illegal imigration from its sources it would be cheaper than building a wall unfortunately that would mean directly developing mexico and some southern american nations not a solution for the us because of their ego and due to the fact that these illegal imigrants participate in the economy working off radar or not they cost less than what they bring it would be shameful to  result into building such a huge wall like the lady said they will still find ways to get in we in europe have the mediteranian sea as our wall it does not stop people arriving in hundreds and thousands into the eu illegaly  those willing to go onto such dreadful and risky journeys to cross the boarder are truely doing so for a good reason they are human beings fleeing poor living conditions in hopes of making their lives better they are not crazy to go through such risks unfortunately the sad truth is that we where the grass is greener fear the consequences of sharing such a priviledged lifetyle with foreigners most europeans and i assume us citizens fear due to employmenttaxes at risk with too many migrants whats the worst that can happen degrade from owning a bmw to a corola having 50 less to spend on stupid things per month whilst people on the otherside struggle for their lives not knowing when they will get killed by their governmentafrica neighbouring ganghondurasmexico malnutritionsickness and fear of spending the rest of their years without hope if they stay where they are  hope is one thing we should never take away from people and it is our duty as betteroff nations to help provide hospitality for those seeking assylumrefuge instead of treating them like criminals and animals put yourself in their shoes and put down your burger and step down from your clouds for just a minuteits important to secure a boarder  even though schengen is doing fine but it is another to split a continent physically that wall is insulting and truely will be a disgust for future generations who will find more humane and inteligent solutions
social media has ruined civil political discourse change my mind
see if you build the wall that wont change much most of immigration is from planes and then them over staying their visit i normally agree with you but here i do not im trying to be respectful as possible there is a adam ruins every thing that tells you why its better to not build a physical wall
im not sure that steven crowder should have put that first woman on the video  im would imagine that there are many people in that area who could easily identify her   i hope she is ok
what if there were no borders anywhere in the world why even have them i agree with second interviewee there is an advantage to letting anyone and everyone in and giving them an ssn and tax them crime tell the police to do their jobs maybe use those extra taxes for good schools mental healthcare and help for people running from ravaged central america while were at it lets go ahead and legalize drugs and prostitution so that we bankrupt the cartels ditch the irs and their crooked exemptions and charge everyone over the age of 18 a progressive income tax taken directly out of their pay no refunds no hr block no exemptions go to a cashless society
i wonder what lgbtq seattle would think of their ad running against crowder content lol
where are some linkssources  to your stats on illegal imigrant crime ratesas far as i can tell any reliable ones dont even exist
did that guy have even one single full thought
dude does way too much pot
that guy with the camera sounds like a moron
its amazing how ignorant people are on this issue 1the guy admits he wants no borders and no walls2says the immigration and drugs are only going to get worse so we should stop fighting it and just let it all in3 thinks trumps physical wall is bad while thinking some imaginary sci fi tech wall that has tech to track undocumented people without any kind of gps tracking chip or implant and that people will just have to carry documentation not paying attention to the fact that the problem is the fact that these people dont have documentation to begin with4spews the liberal talking point that big pharma prescription drugs are a much bigger and more dangerous problem then the drugs coming from outside the country clearly hes never seen a immigration drug bust one of the ones were they round up 3040 guys and a moving truck full of drugs5he thinks we should tax the undocumented illegal immigrants who in order to be in the system to be taxed in the first place would have to be documented again this is part of the problem with illegal immigration to begin withwillful stupidity pisses me off because we live in a age were the information of the whole damn world is at our fucking fingertips theres no excuse for it i have learning disabilities and even i can take the time to look at the information provided on any given topic people will fully functioning brains should sure as fuck be able to do the same
its not gonna keep all of them out but quite certainly pretty much all of them in thats the problem pls just watch this everyone httpsyoutube0wk6rswxqro
so i watched a few of these and thought this guy was really well informed i was impressed with the research he had done for the two genders one but i looked it up and the statistic he sites saying that the 25 percent of our population that are illegal immigrants are causing 30 of the crime in america is completely untrue he is quoting trump who was quoting a bogus article written years ago there are many many statisticsarticles that prove this estimate wrong that 25 percent would have to be committing crime at an impossible rate please dont let this man further the racism in this country research the things you hear from him and anyone else on the internet i was shocked that he would use something so very untrue to argue his opinion here are a couple sources proving him wrong a simple google search would further show that that statistic is completely fabricated httpswwwnprorg20180502607652253studiessayillegalimmigrationdoesnotincreaseviolentcrimehttpswwwnytimescominteractive20180330upshotcrimeimmigrationmythhtmlhttpscrimsasupennedufactcheckdomexicanimmigrantscausecrime
coming out as conservative or even saying donald trumps name in sweden at least in stockholm where i live is literally asking to be dragged out in the middle of the street before being strung upside down and sawed in half whilst everyone watches and spits on you its literally more socially acceptable to identify as a third gender bash men for existing the blind blatant hatred towards men is insane over here cough zara larsson cough  say that borders should not exist and to say that illegal immigration is perfectly reasonable brings me back to 2015s refugee crisiswhat a shitstorm that was back then i was a diehard sjw who made a presentation about the refugee wave which was obviously not rooted in facts and 100 based on emotions at least i got a round of applause from my equally airheaded friends yes im calling myself airheaded bc i was literally go up to anybody in stockholm and say i think our country has a problem with illegal immigrants because of all the proven statistics that point towards illegal immigration being tied with violent crimes and rapesexual assault and theres an 80 chance youll be decked in the face and called a racist or in my case youll have bbut youre an immigrant since youre chinese said to youwhich just goes to show that these swedish sheep know nothing about immigration be it legal or illegal or a supporter of sverigedemokraterna the most conservative party here their leader is awfully annoying but i agree with his stance on immigration whoopsies but go up to somebody and say i identify as a ceiling fan and youll be called progressive instead of a fucking retard sweden is a beautiful country but i hate living in it sometimes when i see how overrun it is with crazy feminists illegal alien worshippers and other deluded alt left idiots theres literally no hope for conservatives in sweden anymore not to trigger people but sometimes i wish i was american and or lived in america because of how accepting it is its not the greatest but its much better than living as a  conservative in europe i sometimes want to scream when i hear privileged ziezir identifying knucklefuckers whine about how oppressive america is like nohelpsorry for the longass comment i just feel like nobody talks about sweden and paints all of us swedes as retarded liberals and im pretty tired of itedit im a 19 year old girl and a chinese immigrant whose parents worked hard to grant me a swedish citizenship when coming here for yall knucklefuckers planning on ing me with your str8 whyte male bullshit
that american kid is dumb and on drugs
hey im a weird looking white dude with a list carefully crafted irrelevant and convoluted retorts ready to condescend my way into looking smart change my mind
boy and bear i hear you amigo
i wonder if crowder sits there sometimes and thinks this person is incredibly stupid
hi steven at 706 you claim that immigrants commit crimes at disproportionate levels every study i have found show this to be the opposite can you provide your sources here here is one source ive read httpswwwwashingtonpostcomnewswonkwp20180619twochartsdemolishthenotionthatimmigrantshereillegallycommitmorecrimeutmterm2ca35b1815berespect best of luck to ya
i think you need a reshoot on this first two sitdowns are geeked up
the guy that wants to allow illegals in and tax them isnt accounting for the fact that they send most of their money back home funneling money out of our economy
as trump himself said maybe a rope
theres a great show called adam ruins everything and he goes over why build a wall would be bad idea and i highly advice watching this
i mean fuck  an xray border why didnt anyone else think of that shit problem solved call president trump and give him the news
she is against the wall because she thinks it will be a waste of money because illegal immigrants will find a way in regardless of walls i actually agree with her but it will slow them down momentarily
this is too short 
pogo
a border wall a 14th century solution to a 21st century problem hope that wall goes real high gotta stop all those people flying in planes with legal tour visas so they dont overstay and become illegals
hey crowder mexican here i want you read my comment keeping in mind that i am mexican not mexicanamerican meaning that i am not watching this video from within the fakevictimculture that you have in americai agree with this video immigration brings bad people into good places if mexicans middleeasterns puerto ricans and other citizens of the world had a culture rich in values such as justice peace and being civilized overall they wouldt have the need of leaving their home country in the first placebut i dont think that building a wall is really going to help i do agree that having a more controlled border implementing regulations and preventing immigration at all is needed but how is a wall going to help if as a lot of people have already said it around half of the immigrants come by air still the other half comes by land but as quirky criminals as we are we are going to find other ways of migrating without going through that wall basically i think that regulating borders is really important i just think that a wall is not going to stop usand by the way really good strategy there from trump separating kids from their families blaming it on democrats then he makes sure it never happens again with an executive order that makes it easier and faster to get the whole family deported to avoid them being separated smart move create a fake problem and fix it passing whichever law you want
leroy is what happens when you dont turn cnn off for a week
i think borders are gonna become a thing of the past ive been talking to a lot of people says the mexican with illegal parents lol
thats 13 12 minutes of my life ill never get back no coherent thoughts from opposers of border wall
the few ruin it for the many  mental white guy shoots up a school  white males are crazy  black guy shoots someone all blacks are murders  cop kills a black guy  all cops are racist  berlin wall oppresses the west  trumps wall is eviltrump says a lot of stupid stupid things the wall might not be financially sound it might not actually lower illegal immigrants and crime it might not do a lot of things but it damn there are so many clueless people
xray border  is this dude retarted
you definitely should have done more to protect that one girl if she gets recognized she could be in some serious trouble
wage gap doesnt exist change your mind
i guess all those mexican drug dealers have been using jetpacks since ever before and crossborder tunnels are just hollywood equipment and all children locked up in cages are actually actors playing in a film
1 measure the length of the border2 divide it by the length of the berlin wall3 now multiply with the number of people who escaped east berlin4 that is if the entire border is covered with millions of land mines barbed wires bazookas and watch towers5 now tell me if such a wall is ever going to work
tax them brilliant but what if they got no money hmm what happens then
rfid chip really 
dude wanted to be the governor of mexico oof
i would love to talk to you about this
can you be a criminal even you didnt know it was illegal
blur her face but not her tag p
im not saying we need a border but we definitely need some sort of well defined divide between nations that serves the function of identifying all of the indivuals that pass through it
the second guy you spoke with is a total communist he is asking to be tagged and treated like an animal that can be tracked this would be utter loss of freedom once you are in the county and have your citizenship you shouldnt be tracked we need less government
you should make a i am pro vaccine change my mind
 the united states is becoming more and more genetically homogenized and there is little hope that the trend can be reversed the extent that a society is civilized is a function of its gene pool once the gene pool has been lost the products of that gene pool are also lost miscegenation with others by inexorably lowering iq is the greatest threat to the survival of whites and their civilizations nothing else is more certain to permanently destroy white civilization yet few whites recognize the threat and many whites actually welcome itthink about that do we want this great country to become south america or africa
why do these episodes make me cringe so much the stumbling of words of people not sure about their standpoint on a certain subject and just how they have no education is very sad
lollllllll xray boarder hahaha  this guy is fried 
the 1550s
lol lets blurr her face but not her id card around her neck rekt chippy says my muddas a beautiful woman
he just wasted all your time talking about deep potty with unrealistic nonsense good show mr crowder hahaha i would have said to the man thank you next
make a wall to protect people from the americans
you guys have to keep in mind that its not just people from mexico coming here illegally so why not build a wall all around the god damn usa dome freedom 5 likes and ill start in the bay area of ca ps im fucken joking 
not only should there be a wall it should be electrified and guarded by snipers keep those terrorist drug lord and human traffickers away
i think the wall would be a huge waste of money i agree something needs to be done about about all the illegal immigration but a wall wont stop anyone i know if i walked all the way from central america to the texas boarder im not turning back because of a wall we need a different strategy
pffthe wants to be the governor on new mexico hes perfect because hes an idiot
dude that guys talking straight year 2060 technology 
austin texas is producing extreme fanatical liberal idiots thanks to the university of texas school of liberal arts  making feminist men  lost its prestige  send your kids to a trade school
this video opened my eyes to something that i never realized i think these people who dont want a wall are uneducatedunintelligent they think the wall means no one in or out like they think an armalite rifle is full auto that kids idea was basically lets make jetsons technology and then go straight up authoritarian and surveil them if trump said what he did the left would say you want to tattoo them like the jews hitlerman we need to stop listening to the ideas of politically braindead idiots we dont do what 3 year olds tell us to why should we listen to generation tide pod
hi steven  hopefully my argument will have you consider not necessarily a change but the efficacy of the wall  the wall itself is a physical construct that will waste resources that can be used elsewhere  i would say instead of looking at the problem as to how do we stop the flow of illegal immigration from mexico to the us or rather illegal immigration via mexico into the united states the questions we should ask are 1 why are people willing to leave this place mexico or where ever they are originally from to go to that place the us  2 why isnt their illegal immigration problem going the other direction or rather a diasporaexodus from the us to mexico or anywhere else on the planet  if you look at mexico it should be a prosperous and safe country  they have a representative democracy similar to the us so at the very least it is not a tyrannical totalitarian or communist regime  it has a diverse landscape and dynamic natural resources like the united states in other words they arent a 1 trick pony like say kuwait  the reality is that even with all these natural and political resources mexico is a dangerous and corrupt country  instead of the wall if we were able to work with mexicans on improving those 2 problem areas mexico could become safer and less corrupt country which should result in a more desirable place to eek out an existence  if that happens the wall would be rendered as useless as the german wall  to simplify things the us is rich mexico is poor  the us is not too corrupt mexico is a cesspool of corruption  the us is safer than mexico  everything needs to reach an equilibrium including rich vs poor safe vs unsafe rampant corruption vs not as corrupt  while a wall may reduce that force of equilibrium its not going to solve it  drugs and human trafficking are far too alluring a score to complete in the us and the cartels that operate them have far too many resources to be stopped by a stupid wall  as long as their is money to be made they are going to find away in  it may take longer they have to go over they may have to go under they may have to go around but in the end they are going to find a way in  our best course of action give them notice my use of non binary gender pronouns  arent you proud of me  a reason not to leave
the second guy sounds like an idiot
you should do a video on the death penalty id like to hear your views on it if our opinions differ i could possibly have my opinion changed
do an episode on the death penalty
jezzzz louise that was hilarious  cudos steven for keeping a straight face
i dont agree with this whts the point in building a wall
govrnment regulation is bad for citizens change my mind
the guy in the white shirt wants gattaca to become realityscarylets give the government more poweridiot
research shows that people are afraid of immigrants because they think immigrants are a threat to their safety and engage in many violent and property crimes however quantitative research has consistently shown that being foreign born is negatively associated with crime overall and is not significantly associated with committing either violent or property crime if an undocumented immigrant is arrested for a criminal offense it tends to be for a misdemeanor  criminology website from university of oxforddear god i hope as many people can see this as possible
bro that statistic that undocumented people commit 37 of all american homicides im sorry but thats just completely fucking bullshit  undocumented migrants or immigrants in general have been proved by statistics to be the demographic in the country to commit the least amount of crime 37 im sorry but that is just horribly and laughingly wrong lol you can have whatever stance you want on illegal immigration but to say they commit 37 of all homicides is america is just stupendously wrong all the hispanic gangbangers you know all the cholos who shoot and kill people are all hispanic americans they commit a lot of homicide if over 50 of homicides are done by blacks than to your understanding 37 of all homicides are done by undocumented migrants so what that just means 13 of homicides are done by all whites all immigrants all latinos all native americans and all asians like what somehow a fruit picker commits 37 of all homicide while all the cholo hispanic gang organizations in america which are overwhelmingly americans who are latino commit virtually no homicides think about it all those hispanic delinquents in california texas new mexico who shoot and kill are all mexican americans sorry but again that statistic just sounds incredibly retarded when you look at the population of these people and this and that and just logic in general
that second guy is a moron also he claims to be pure spanish decent from spain but looks 100 wild mexican 
he was basically talking about world citizenship with rfid geotagging capabilities
i personally think the wall is fucking retarded sorry for the language but it honestly is were wasting billions of dollars of american money for one big retarded wall all for what to keep immigrants out i hope people realize this isnt 1987 people crossing the border is incredibly old fashioned 910 of new undocumented immigrants become undocumented via overstayed visas theres also the issue with interfering with native americans with their land in the border people who own private land in the border all types of shit the statistics dont lie obama went hard on border crossing and the majority of new undocumented migrants arent even mexican a big mix from everyone in the world you honestly have to be clinically retarded to think building a wall is a good idea
leroy trehill the next new mexico governor we need digital passcodes  xray walls and written consent for the 21st century open borders society ruled by the masterminds  vote now  lol
heres the logic of the wall people are crossing the border illegally we do not want people to cross the border illegally people cannot walk through walls a wall would prevent many people from crossing the border illegally it is impossible to stop all crime it is possible to prevent some crime by making it more difficult to commit those crimes building a wall will discourage some if not most illegal immigrants from attempting to illegally cross the border
if you think about it the illegal mexican immigrants want to escape from mexico because its a shithole so chances are they are decent people rather than build a wall why not deport or just shoot all the mexicanamerican criminals and replace them with illegal mexican immigrants
this one was painful to listen to my goodness
borderless teleportation in 510 years whos ready for it
build a wall out of illegal immigrants
i got a fucking headache when he spoke to that guya
this is the guy consuming the drugs from the southhahaha xrays
building a wall is a waste of money and time  feels like united states wants to build the berlin wall history repeats itself doesnt it
yes lets build an expensive wall to stop the minority of immigrants coming illegally through the border the wall itself isnt going to be stopping a whole lot of immigrants coming illegally because the majority of them come here legally and overstay their visas we should focus that money more on catching the immigrants already here because as stated earlier most come in legally but live here illegally
not gay jared looking like a snack in the corner  no homo
what in the actual fuck is the dude in the white talking about  xray border what is this star trek
i just realized that he looks like tobuscus
adam ruins everything had an episode explaining against the wall and why it is so useless
that one dude that brought the camera is definitely on smack
a wall is a waste of money and wont stop cartels from getting their drugs into the usa lol and illegal immigrants will still come in most over stay their visas
ladies and gentlemen the next governor of new mexico brought to you by 3 years of developed undeveloped thoughts
fucking idiocracy in real life god damn
the wall is dumb much smarter to take over mexico canada and south america
where is the evidence that illegal immigrants commit 37 of homicides
that face at the end lmfao
the guy from new mexico saying he is spanish and not mexican because his family has been in new mexico since the 1550s lol what country does this guy think his family was in prior to the 1840s and does he tell spanish people he is spanish oh yea my family is from spain we left in like 1550 hahaha
what a moron
we need a border to keep him out
whether you share the same believes as this guy or not its amazing how he puts himself out there to have his opinion challenged
how does 3 of the populationillegal immigrants do 37 of the murders thats ridiculous
how does 3 of the populationillegal immigrants do 37 of the murders thats ridiculous
if obama built the wall everyone would be for it
the  second person in the white shirt was on drugs or something
made it to 1344 before i couldnt take the stoners explanation anymore i feel accomplished 
i love crowder but that last guy was so stupid and painful to watch i had to stop
wtf is this guy saying how do we give em elcetronic chips even though they wont check in themselves lost 10 iq thanks
hearing this dude freethink through his theoretical border tech is super awkward you should give him a box of crayons let him draw pictures explaining his thought process it might be more accurate
bring up one example from history where a wall has worked
mexicos gonna pay for it all oh wait shit
omg people are so dumb a xray wall seriously
really disappointed that no one could state a valid argument against the wall i lean conservative on immigration matters and i can think of many of reasonsproblems with the proposed wall
steven crowder please redo this topic over in a college and not in a street corner  this guy is an idiot  he mentioned drugs a lot  he does not speak for all of us  his family has been in new mexico 220 years before it was even a statelol    xray borderlol  teleportationlol   master mindslol  the first lady bless her heart tried and had a better idea  she just didnt speak enough english to get her point across  when she said she was all for illegal immigration i know she meant legal immigration
about to go to cancun to get some bitches
immigration reform needs to happen in this country but neither parties are being constructive towards this
ladies and gentlemen the next governor of new mexico
the wall is meant to keep you in not them when this ponzi scheme called the us government collapses ill say told you so retards
lets address americas real problem people need to stop doing drugs and help to get rid of their addictions if there is no consumer base there is no drug trade abuse of prescription drugs is also really hurting our country smarter cleaner and healthier citizens wont fall to the machine of drug trade america especially needs to step up its game to have real rehabs that monitor peoples addiction and help them kick the habit people really are struggling in these times where everyone is angry illegal acts are ballooned on the news stress is ramping ip by internal struggles and no proper discourse is occurring between the two parties
wth was leeroy talking about 
i had to play this back four times you said undocumented immigrants 35 are committing 37 of all homicides and the murders in the us on top of that you throw out they are responsible for 13 of violent crimes you are not just an idiot you are a moron and a brainwashed propaganda machine where do you get this shit from do you even hear yourself
i dont understand how a wall would stop anyone
i hope everything turned out okay for that lady in the beginning its truly horrifying to see people who work hard and honestly to be pushed into a position of fear like that by the less honest
a wallany other ideas or is that it ladders and shovels airplanes boats if we actually thought about the problem and discussed solutions honestly we might get somewhere the reason we dont discuss the best solution is because the top breadwinners like having immigrants around to lower wages its all a show which you are probably aware of but you cant help but pander to your shit for brains audience to make a profitinteresting that you always show the people who cant articulate the points that decimate your argument which functionally makes these videos propaganda why ask people to change your mind why not just have a sign that says come disagree with me so i can flex my ego at you
whats wrong with the comments
i was so impressed by how professionally you handled that x ray border guest 
i just want to know how a really expensive wall is going to solve the immigration issue sit down with adam ruins everything and talk about the wall that video would easily hit 10mil views
building a wall would be massively expensive to build maintain  and mantax dollars that could we well spent on something else all someone has to do is get visa get a plane ticket and fly over and never leavethat expensive wall is now useless
wow i plan on becoming the governor of new mexico lol
wish you did this near me would love to talk to you on this i am for tighter immigration but feel the wall is the wrong solution
this spanish dude is an idiot   wow
just so all you people know new mexico is a state in the us and no its not part of mexico it has been a state since 1912 the guy in the white shirt politics are complete shit but he is right about having spanish blood he is what you call a mestizo which is a term traditionally used in spain that originally referred a person of combined european and native american descent regardless of where the person was born northern new mexicans are a hyrbid mix of spanish puebloan and navajos the hispanics in northern new mexico are not mexicans history and dna even proves it research about the history of new mexico and look up the crypto jews of new mexico that came from spain during the spanish inquisition and settled all over present day new mexico during those times there were literally thousands of them the spaniards who colonized northern new mexico intermarried with pueblo and navajo indians which is why he has that skin color santa fe new mexico was for generations the northernmost seat of rule for nueva espaa  which translate to the new kingdom of spain he is right about him having spanish blood is he full blooded spanish no he is part how do i know all this because i was born and raised in new mexico and me and my family are mestizo ourselves we are the hispanos of nuevo mexico also i even took a coarse in college on the history of new mexico at unm so i have a great deal of knowing what im talking about on this subject here so you nonnew mexicans can get some education on my state and my peoplehttpsenwikipediaorgwikipuebloanspueblo communities are located in the presentday states of new mexico arizona and texas mostly along the rio grande and colorado rivers and their tributarieshttpsenwikipediaorgwikinewmexicanspanishis a variant of spanish spoken in the united states primarily in the northern part of the state of new mexico and the southern part of the state of colorado by the hispanos of new mexicospeakers of new mexican spanish are mainly descendants of spanish colonists who arrived in new mexico in the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuriesin the meantime some spanish colonists coexisted with and intermarried with puebloan peoples and navajoshttpsenwikipediaorgwikihispanosofnewmexicofor most of its modern history new mexico existed on the periphery of the spanish empire from 1598 until 1821due to the comanche contact with the rest of spanish america was limited and new mexican spanish developed closer trading links with the comanche than the rest of new spain in the meantime some spanish colonists coexisted with and intermarried with puebloan peoples and navajos enemies of the comanche new mexicans of all ethnicities were commonly enslaved by the comanche and apache of apacheria while native new mexicans were commonly enslaved and adopted spanish language and culturein spanish the predominant term for this ethnic group has always been hispano analogous to californio and tejano in new mexico the spanishspeaking population of colonial descent was always proportionally greater than those of california and texas the term is commonly used to differentiate those who settled the area early around 1598 to 1848 it can also refer to anyone of spanish or indohispanic descent native to the american southwesthttpswwwamazoncompueblonationscenturiesindianhistorydp0940666073one of the books we read when i was in college which shows the interaction between the puebloans and the spanish conquest in new mexico
the wall wouldnt do anything its ultimately pointless outside of being symbolic as if to say stay out of our country illegal immigrants will find ways in regardless it would cost billions of dollars and your immigration problems will continue walls dont work in 2018
i would have to agree with last guest that big pharma is the main drug problem however the xray idea is a little out there would be expensive and possible  health effects we already feeling the pains from wifi but if you think about it would it still be a wall just an invisible one made by frequency
but the wall can cause economic problems man oh well i guess
build the xray wall   change my mind
i think the xray border is an amazing idea lol
the woman at 113 why blur her face but not her card that she hanging arround her neck 
i love the last interview both of them were very respectful and civil i have to admit i didnt understand mr leroys plan that well hopefully he can work on the details
that dude is right boarders will be a thing of the past as the one world government is implemented  everything that is happening now are all incremental steps towards this inevitable future
this guy from new mexico governor have mercy but im sure hes a perfect candidate for the liberalsdemocrats
im notuh mexican though im spanishuh my family have been inuh new mexico sinceuh the 1550suh
dumb americans build a wall around the whole us and dont let the crazy gun toting idiots out youre all fucked up in the head
i dont mind illegal immigrants but i understand the desire to tighten the borders however i think the wall will be way too expensive and mexicans can just fly to canada without a visa and sneak through that border so youd really have to make two walls just make it easier for mexican citizens to come to the us legally but maybe increase the punishment if they get caught to please both sides
well first of vox is useless and only there to push the lefts agenda
mr crowder while the intent of the wall is to stop people what about the animals that have no recognition of imaginary lines that countries recognize as borders   i support border enforcement but not in the form of a wall  the ecological implications are not being properly considered
ever wonder why all the white peopleliberals get offended over conservative racism meanwhile the ones we are being racist towards dont find it racist
he said how do they get checked if there is no wall but if youve ever driven to mexico you know that there is a fence and you do get checked when crossing the border why is he talking as if theres nothing at the border
building a wall doesnt seem like a reasonable solution to the problem most mexicans come into the country legaly and simply overstay their welcome not trying to get visa or citizinship
i really wish i could of sat down with you on this topic  i hope one day lol
i love how leroy walks off the set like a conquering hero lmao
im not mexican sounds like a taco bender to me
lets do it lets make a xray gate
im sorry i just cant get over how white that criminal was in that vox video
that last dude made no sense
the guy doesnt understand that by making all illegal immigrants legal citizens will not increase the economy rather decrease  once they are legal they have a right to welfare and other social benefits
id love to hear a debate on veganism
it could be a xray scannerahyou know when you walk through itahyour number goes through like a databaseahyeahwell get right on that  why dont you scribble a schematic of the plans in crayon and send it to mr president trump
im sorry but you have no point that supports building a wall the thing should be called better border control to control who comes in the country  change my mindyour for that not for the wall no point you brought up supports the wallif you are combined with the points you did bring up about border control youre saying that theres no decent control anywhere in the world cause i dont see no wall around no country for that purpose so ehmm what
stevens face at the end made me think of jim halpert and im living for it
wow that spanish guy sounds incredibly stupid
i hat how you never actually hear an intellectual debating you never hear solid points from the randos i may be wrong but can anyone point me to a video that actually has a good back and forth
i almost turned it off after the second guy opened his mouth whoa boy
the majority of the human population is incredibly stupid
honestly how did steven not laugh nonstop cause i wouldnt have been able to keep it together
they already tax people coming in legally applying for a visa work permit and green card are not free it costs money so his argument is moot
that guy was batshit crazy xray devices come on man have a real solution an engineer to do your work pathetic seems like a good guy at heart but my goodness that was pathetic best of luck on your run for governor
the dude from spain is kinda an idiot thats a little overboard to say but he doesnt know what hes talking about or realize the statistics that represent the crime and problems with immigration you handled that very respectfully and confidently
the governor of nm 
liberals the most complex mind fuck of human history
thanks for another great video
build that wall tall and long and lets not forget deep as fuck too  you know how rats like to tunnel
a few mastermind individuals
hey i just smoked meth before i came on but masterminds
that motherfucker in the white from new mexico is such a fucking idiot bro that nigga said im spanish bitch your mexican hes a dumbass
people are misinformed i appreciate what you are doing crowder keep trying
this is the guy thats gonna see the mark of the beast and be like that shits mine
really shouldve blurred her id guys
i think we need to strengthen ties with mexico in an effort to help us both instead of keeping jobs to go there we should encourage it we will benefit from cheaper labor than here while simultaneously improving their economy and country so mexicans have less of a drive to immigrate to the us we partner with china so much but they are an ocean away mexico is landlocked with us so having our goods produced by them and transported cheaper to us would benefit us both and help with the immigration problem so remove fines or fees for exporting jobs if they are to mexico
a physical wall is a waste of money its not practical because of the terrain in certain areas along our border the border itself is very long and most importantly immigrants and traffickers will always find a way in a simple ladder or rope can get people over the wall is 6 feet deep you say they will dig 7 feet traffickers already employ methods of delivering drugs as simple and primitive as catapults and even air cannons like the ones they use in sporting events to launch shirts
so the proimmigrationguy wants everone to wear a dogtag man the left truly are the totalitarians
i think you are very respectful i appreciate what you are trying to do i would never be able to stay that calm
this guys from new mexico is an idiot whats with the extra as he puts on the end of every word futureaa drugsaa the kids today absolutely butcher the english language so bad theyre having to use closed caption on people speaking english what the fuck do they teach at schools anymore
the border issue is not about drugs because as we all know the real weight arrives with approval from someone with power they come in by plane with clearance i believe this issue is solely about the demographic changing in the united states which is not comforting to the white american i dont blame them but its a little too late
omg i had to stop 2 minutes into the second guy he has no clue what he is talking about you can tell he doesnt know any real information about anything remotely related to the wall and is clearly pulling shit out of his ass
steven as someone who is also a conservative i agree with you on most things but the wall is a massive waste of money considering the majority of illegal mexican immigrants just fly here on work visas and stay not to mention the massive cost and the mountain ranges and all the other things such as geological figures that would be either impossible to cut through or cost an even more absurd amount of money than it would already cost
xray freeflow and written hall passeslol
people that are against legal immigration and the wall take all your locks off your doors let me know how that goes for you
the wall is a bad idea because it costs taxpayers more than it rewards them that is why we have different border control methods like officers helicopters cars detectors etc if you waste billions on a wall it will be harder to cross the border however it will still be crossed he makes the mistake of equating border control and the wall there are definitely more effective technologies for securing the border which would be harder for you getting over  under a wall or escaping a helicopter or jeep secondly the issue is not to secure our borders its to figure out why people want to come here and to resolve the issue criminals come to earn money off drugs so we need to do better about reducing drug demand in the us as long as there is strong demand criminals will meet the supply as for the illegal immigrants who come for a better life and opportunity they deserve a faster easier process to a green card it takes years waiting for a visa which is rediculous if youre on the run from a gang or going hungry without a job do you think illegal immigrants enjoy crossing the border they do it out of desperation they deserve to have an easy process for legality so they can come and work unemployment is at record lows and companies are struggling to find honest workers workers are the backbone of the economy the fundamental difference between republicans and democrats on this issue is that republicans want to keep mexicans out and democrats want to bring them in framing them as criminals or innocents and all the other arguments are just used to support one or the other side i want to let them in because i believe they do more good than harm to us and as a human i dont want to be complicit in another humans suffering
build the wall
chinas wall is fucking massive lmao
china built a wall like a huge wall a huuuuuuuuuuuge wallwhys no one protest that
scientifical 
dudes straight outta minority report  1027  d
i feel it would be easier for people to actually study and take a step back and realize the level of unintelligence that they side with self reflection  is a beautiful thing as well as self insight im no genius nor do i claim to be i dont know but common sense has been long gone from the american people since before i was born in my opinion
yeah build the wallwell pay it with credit cards im pretty sure the native americans would of have liked to have built that wall
fucks sake just detonate small nukes along the border so its too eradicated to pass through
why is the bad opinion always stevens opinion its so sad that he just feeds the hate
why didnt i think of using a scientifical ray
there are actually so many problems with building the wall 1 phycological image to future generations of a massive walls will only increase fear and discrimination 2 people who own land across the border dont want a wall in their property so you cant really build around them  nor build it without permission 3 massive cost 4 prone to fail as it would have many ways to enter because of its massive size 5 drug dealers will only increase the price of drugs because transporting it will be more expensive since lets face it americans wont stop consuming drugs 6 it blocks tons of migration patterns of animals across the border 7 illegal people are still going to want to cross like the berlin wall and people will die trying to cross like they did in germany 8 its not really solving the issue at root its just putting duck tape to a sinking ship you can hope with all your heart that it will be better but it will eventually break 9 massive outrage from people 10 looks bad internationally in a world where we are supposed to be interconnected and not building more barriers
that guy just describe a new world order and electric scanner lol creepy
this guy may have autism
were all imigrants
stevenlooks like youre in austin go to san antonio and see what the turn out is
i think this is a little bit misleading because when you say the wall people just assume the giant billion dollar trump wall rather than securing the border through other means
that guys spanish well i guess everyone can be anything right now
donald trump is doing a great job      change my mind
were all thinking in 2018 but the last guy is thinking in 3018
x ray wall would be great no more illegal immigrant offspring
mexico haves a wall on its southern border and it works quite well  although mexico allows other illegala to pass through mexcio they dont allow them to stay in mexico if they choose to they force them to move on to america or be deported back down south
i cant wait for more change my mind episodes
im with the guy proposing a scientifical ray border
walls dont work  great wall of china didnt accomplish shit
id have to sit down with a few mastermindswhat this boi trying to be a supervillain
the second dude was talking too much mindless bs
i wish you would have a conversation with a competent person about this topic this guy obviously doesnt sound like he knows wtf is going on lol
bowser did nothing wrong  change my mind
over 60 of the people who come here do so by plane this man is trippin
this guy one day plans on being the governor of new mexico wtf
a wall of xrays is literally the same concept as the wall just because there is no physical wall means nothing
the last dude gave me confusion
this is it folks this is the type of voter democrats drool over inarticulate uninformed and plainly blind to reality this is what they want god help us
please redo this segment but without mildly retarded people sitting down talking to you
its hilarious to hear this guy from mexico pitch his proposal about wanting to have some sort of airport securitylike xray scanner but not having a wall im like bitch do u think these drug cartel guys and criminals would even bother to go there just to get identified for their crimes and get taxed aint nobody got time for that and he dares to run for governor in his country with that type of logic  wow
that look 1317
trump did say illegal immigrants are bringing in drugs crime and essentially trouble to americawhether true or not if they bring drugs etc trump did say this and its very easily verifiable
so embarrassed to admit im from new mexico right now
that second person being interviewed sounds like a typical chicano to me dumbass
the arguments i hear most about the wall are trump is racist and hes wasting out tax dollars building a wall both stupid excuses usually from people who are only against the wall because they have a deep abiding hatred of trump and anything they takes money away from subsidizing their pet special interest group
i oppose the wall on grounds that it is a waste of money to build a physical wall when the vast majority of illegal immigrants entered the country legally and just overstayed their visit never returning home  i dont believe it will be effective at its primary job and i think the money would be far better spent on other thingsperhaps even immigration related  though i think a crackdown of illegal immigration has to come not from border security but reforms business laws that severely punish employers that hire non citizens without visas
that dumbass in the white shirt says we should tax them and send them through a checkpoint but the point is they wont the wall is what will force them through checkpoints
this guy describing an airport
well fuck this guy is a future governor show him some dam respect
you bring up many valid points and i mean that from all your work not only in this vdo and as much as i enjoy your vdos after watching this one i think uve missed the bigger issue in the usa idiots can vote 
i can imagine the future governor of new mexicos plan working kind of but it would still be better with a secure wallever watch the series fringe  where massive spoilers there are two different dimensions of earth that people can cross between  in the alternate earth the secretary of state afraid of invasion from our earth implements a national id  law which requires everyone to use their national id card called a show me for any sort of transaction  want to ride the bus  let me see your show me  want a pack of cigarrettes at 711  show mei imagine it would be possible to do something similar using rf chip implants  it wouldnt matter if people crossed the border away from point of entry because once they attempted to have any sort of interaction with society it would be necessary for them to go to authorities to be issued a show me  if implemented carefully this could make it nigh impossible for black markets to circumvent the system because any goods coming in would need to be tracked by the governmentso yeah it could work  if were willing to give over all most of our civil rights to a frighteningly powerful police statewhat was that guys name again  i want to vote for anyone other than him
too many stupid fuckin people with dumb ass youtube channelsfuck your idiotic audience  your content is shite dudelearn something about your world so you dont sound like an absolute moron mexicans are so goddam stupideducation isnt cool  their machismo bullshit is more important
white kids shoot schools tho
majority of illegal immigrants came in legally but overstayed their visas  a wall wouldnt stop that in fact making it easier to immigration and emigrate  would  help
can you imagine the construction cost of a xray wall the cost of labor for radiologists securing the wall the cost of electric usage and the cost of maintenance lol now that would be an expensive wall
so basically lets install xray machines instead of a wall to scan a code on a  person and create a way to x ray them without giving them testicular cancer
that guy is clearly on something
he just needs to talk to someone smareter than him right now because he doesnt know the scientifical name
1028 simply funny
crowder my dude i watch your videos because i agree with a lot of what you say but statistics isnt going to change anyones mind its beating a dead horse its best to just let the world eat itself and let the proof of the actions of the vocal minority eat themselves my dawg sit back smoke a cig and just let them do what they think is best and watch it burn
i aprciate your views although i dont tend to side with you it is awesome how you really try to bring people to the table and argue their point of view  the only way for us to move forward as a country is to come together and sit at the table just like this and say things out loud to each other in order to find middle ground democracy wasnt built by screaming at the other side who disagrees with you it was made by having the conversation and trying to work through it together as a nation i dont always agree with you but as i stated before i appreciate your views and topics discussed 
free thought lets master mind an invisible check point powered by the fluxuh capacitoruh
crowders face at the endhahaha
cocaine is a powerful drug
he should do a change my mind session of earth is round or more proper oblate spheroid change my mind
build the wall with your ass lol
the second person to get interviewed wants to be the governor of new mexico oh goodness
in my opinion they should not build the wall physically but spend more money on patrol where if we want to enter they have to search us and do background checks to make sure they dont have a criminal record or any type of drugs on them
the spanish dude was for sure on cocaine
the spanish man really kept digging a hole for himself he was talking out his ass whats all this tech he is talking about
omfl that ending
bro this isnt fair the guy with the white shirt makes the argument look like an idiot im for the wall plain and simple but you need to give an educated person a shot at a sit down with you
my familys been in new mexico since 1515 and i am like is this guy serious
omg i tried but when this dude used one lady saying she knows a couple of criminals to excuse the widespread fear migrants have of contacting police when a crime is committed against them shameful
i died when he brought up xrays
that guy is quite specialand he want to be governor of new mexico  its hard to imagine that hes that ignorant and that nobody has set him straight
that spanish guy was plain retarded unbearable to listen to
it makes sense to give people a path towards citizenship by a line must be drawn somewhere dude if there was no border along the rio grande all of mexico would be living in america by now same goes for canada and their visas with the ukrainians if the law isnt respected all of ukraine would be living in alberta by now law must be respected sorry folks thats  just how it is you cant just tax them living standard would go down every month as more and more migrants poor in due to the new opportunity in the laxed law it has nothing to do with racsism or how americans dont value how industrious mexicans are or how good their work ethic is theirs just not enough crumbs of bread to go around for those who decided cutt in front of the line you want in study hard like i did get a pr application and get in line your not the only one opportunity is equal and fair for those who respect the system not cheat it
i wish us agriculturealists had a man like crowder to explain how agriculture works
what the fuck
crowder blocked me  
im thinking of neimg the governor of new mexico sokidll be lucky to see 30 with his fatneck lookinass
i disagree with building a wall because i think it would cost too much money also where would we get the money i do think that illegal immigration is a problem and we should find a solution
xray wallrotfl
id love to to the talk even if i dont speak english perfectly
so that guy doesnt want a border but wants an xray border  um what
low hanging fruit
wait do sanctuary cities protect illegal immigrants even when theyre actively participating in illegal actions like money laundering why would being in a sanctuary city keep her from reporting a money laundering ring isnt that the point of sanctuary cities that she can safely report them without fear of being deported
i find it incredible that people think we should have open our borders its bad enough that people dont like coming here legally the dumbest thing i hear constantly is america is rich we have enough food and money for everyone guys health care isnt free college isnt free the cost of living has gone up some people need two jobs to manage food portions are decreasing and eventually everything people ran from to come here will catch up to them many people might think its a bright idea now because of the whole hippie mentality being a cool thing but wait until things start to get harder for your kids and great grand kids if you think things are tough now for many of you refusing to have kids until your 30s because of debt or other financial issues just wait illegals dont give a rats ass about our laws or our system funny how some fools actually fight for them
omg deport this guy
i feel like you shouldnt even show this guy that could barely be considered a conversation props to you steven for listening to this guy who would be outsmarted by most 10 year olds
i dont support the wall what we need is to conquer mexico and make it another state of the us ha
interdimensional pedophile projecting images of the moon tier ideas going on right her bruh
what the fuck is this guy smoking
x r a y s are the wey
build the wall says canadian immigrant
sounds like a pretty acoustic idea
think of the migrating animalsbundy got shit for the tortoise and some ah wants a fuckig wallhmmmso that is a disgrace  for use to fuck over more animalswe fucking people up all over the worldget the gd cia the fuck out of sa
i agree with your stance on guns but building an actual wall is fucking crazy we dont need to build one right now and i dont think the problem is ever going to be bad enough to build a physical object that divides nationshow about we work on ways to minimize the impact illegal immigrants have on the country without just straight up building a fucking wall im sorry but come on man think a little bit thats why people are upset at you if you cant minimize the impact of illegal immigrants then unless we are at war with them we shouldnt build a wall or do anything at all about it im sorry but i think you might be a little biased in this instance
i think you should have made it more clear to him that the wall is being built not to prevent immigration but to prevent undocumented individuals from simply walking in and out as they please and being able to commit crimes and not pay taxes sounds like your not against a path to citizenship you just want the government to be able to easily track who goes in and out
fucking globalists this guy in white lives in an utopia
must have iq of 90 to vote the democrats would be done for sure
holy hell the more of these i watch i just want to sit and smash my head on a wall so many people just clueless
i think i lost brain cells listening to the gentleman in the white shirt
xray border wtf dude is high rfid chips with gps is whats coming maybe were all so hooked on our phones they can track us at will already maybe just give people free iphones at the border make em sign a contract and pay their phone bill to keep service  make them slaves to luxury like us democrats liberals are pushing for a global community but you can bet the rich and powerful will still live in gated communities with security or patrolled mansions
yeah were just gonna slap an xray checkpoint in the middle of the nonexistent border and were gonna expect people to come wait and stand in line instead of and i know this might be a shock that someone would ever do something so inconceivably dastardly walking around
if that guy is going to be the governor of new mexico pray for new mexico
i really appreciate his respect for everyones argument even if it sounds crazy he takes the time to try and understand it rather than just labelling it as dumb
hey guy with the prethought about immigrationyou are a very low information human please come back when you actually wake up and have a valid and calculated brain fire
the spanish guy isnt just talking about open borders he is talking about the nau north american union which would be like the eu travel between the member nations wouldnt be undocumented but you would be freely able to travel between each member nation
mexican guy is on drugs
did he say his family has been in new mexico since the 1550summm he mustve failed american history and if he was born here  why the accent
lets have a wall with a minefield a big fucking minefield
leroy for governor  xray borders  and just wright a note
you know this guy is an idiot when youre high af and you cant stop laughing at how out of touch he is xd
how the hell do you not even crack a smile during xray border barf
build the wall and deport all illegals
we should make the space force happen change my mind
most of the persons seems to talk just what they saw in the news or a bad tv show instead of read more on the issue and at least have some backgrounds to expose their ideas  now regarding the wall us can do what they decides to do in their territory the wall itself already exists and was put there by yes you got it bill clinton if i were an us tax payer i would say dont waste money in the wall immigrants will cross the border no matter what you want a bettermore secure border the better are their neighbors the more secure will be your border help them to improve their situation i know i know some may say but it is not our countryresponsibility  but guess what all we live in the same planet no escape of it for now
wow please find some intelligent people to talk with
that second guy was an idiot who kept contradicting himself yea we are going to have digital tags on people that scan them as they hike across the dessert
lol wtf xray boarder
i think borders in general are gonna become a thing of the pastsoooo this guy goes home to a house apartment student housing whatever and there are no walls no doors no protection of any kind right if he drives a vehicle do you think hes removed the doors and leaves the key with the vehicle so that anyone can come and go unrestricted to use his vehicle in exchange for paying taxes no of course not hes applying race as his qualifier and removing logical thought from the process which deems him a racist
why build a few million dollar wall when you can build a few trillion dollar giant xray across the border with enough power to give the chinese cancer from the other side of the planet so stupid it just might work im voting for that guy
some of these guys have good intentions but they are very nave if thats the case all south america will be here
what surprised you most with this change my mind and what arguments do you most often hear against the walli cannot reply to your post for some reason but here is my replywhat surprised me the most is that there were not many who came to sit down and talk like with other ones
hahahahahahahaaaa im 324 mins into this videoaround 1008 is he a special kind of stoopid lol
how do you do that without a secure border um i dont know
lmao tax them make them citizens  building a wall isnt going to stop illegal immigration will it slow it down maybe the more you stop people from doing something the more ways they are going to find to do those things the real question is can we really change the mexican government and the lifestyle there so people dont feel like they need to leave their country for a better future
i didnt make it through the final edits 
that dude need to lay off the meth or other speed
xray guy is the type of guy to believe the flat earth theory wokeaf

white shirt guy said he wants to become a governor oh lord
are we talking about science fiction
lmaoooo how did you keep a straight face
do another one of this video
so the guy in white thinks we should do the same thing as the nazis with barcodes and the republicans are the nazis for wanting a wall
wow the level of utter stupidity the leroy just displayed is sickening it is sad to see a man in his 20s with the mental capacity of a 9 year old
we tore walls down in the 80s now we want to erect new barriers it will be a sad day for the world if this passes
wheres the source of the crimes immigrants commit 37 of it serious question
this guy is a idiot
how you got the patience to listen to this xray border
advocates of illegal immigration are all over the media stoking the fires that separate good american from good american  these predators love to create discord distrust and fear among people that would otherwise have good will towards each other americans are not supposed to be disunited on certain issues  without the one law for all principle we can never hope to create in this nation the peaceful family of love and good will that it ought to house  no one is expecting illegal criminals to go through anything that american criminals dont experience daily  any criminal in this nation going to prison is separated from their children  we are not asking the illegal entrants to do the unusual  the argument goes that illegals entrants are only committing misdemeanors  the reality is that each and every one of them costs the american taxpayer upwards of 36000 annually  that is no misdemeanor  that is grand theft  americans must not be so foolish as to allow the guests who demonstrate no respect for our laws to further divide us against each anotherthere is a reason that most ice agents are hispanic  these courageous people know what it means to live with masses of amoral personalities that have little to no respect for a nations laws  these insightful hispanic men and women are among the best americans trying to fight injustice and to protect our nation from devolving into yet another failed state which will be the unavoidable result if the numbers of amoral illegals are permitted to increase and to further corrode the unity of americas good people
way too short
you cannot be governor if you add an a on the end of words
where do you find those retards
the wall needs to be built whether virtual or real brick  mortar  the people who dont support it why dont you leave your doors unlocked when you go out im sure  you would not mind people going into your house  without you there  the drug problem is simple find the warehouse or lab and send in an a10 that would take care of it
pineapple does not belong on pizza change my mind
yo dude maybe post your sources otherwise you can trumpet straight bullshit like oh i dont know illegal immigrants commit 37 of all crime in the us
look up secure fence act in 2006 clinton and obama voted in favor of it a fence a wall what the fucks the difference its a god damn barrier fucking idiots
i hope that woman is ok
we have to resurrect bran the builder to help us
who left that man unattended he just needs to link up with his mastermind friends to solve this problem what a free thinker smh
hi steven  you always say that if us as viewers have an argument we can always leave a comment  here is how i will try to change your mindi personally care very deeply about the social aspect of the issue of immigration  however i understand that this is not the case for many people so i will start by explaining why building a wall does not make sense economically  the wall will cost about 20 billion dollars i got this information from cbs but it is very well known  many of the illegal immigrants coming into this country actually come here legally on a plane and then overstay their visa  in this case the wall would be useless  instead i think the money should be used to create a better and faster vetting process at the border  we already have people stationed at the boarder  security could always be increases again with the 20 billion  i do agree that we should know who is coming into the country  however there are many people coming here to simply provide for their families  it should be easier for them to come into the country and seek sometimes seek refuge from gang violence and other abuse  these people will help our economy and the vetting system will allow us to quickly send criminals away  diving into the social aspect people are all people humans are all humans  my life does not hold more value than an immigrant simply because i was lucky enough to be born in the us  therefore we need to have sympathy for people who are just coming here so they can survive  furthermore the wall is a symbol of hatred and isolationism  the us is a leader of the world  we cannot be isolationists and nationalists  we must bring people together and be accepting of those that need help and are different  what will this wall say about our country to the rest of the world  lastly everyone besides native americans and african americans as they were forced to come here unwillingly are immigrants  we all just need to love each other
lets just send that guy from new mexico back
a wall wont work people will make tunnels or find ways over it there are not enough people to monitor the whole wall also there will be people who have compassion and go against the law and help them the same thing happened in many wars it will happen not everyone agrees on this its a humanitarian issue i agree with a lot of things the nm guy mentioned there is just no way a wall will work people who are desperate will find a way over or under it they are desperate and walk hundreds of miles a wall wont stop them
ok lets break it downthe persons claimwhen it comes to crime theres like maybe a small percentage that brings drugscrowder then claims that trump didnt say that finally he admits that trumps quote was worded poorly heres the quotewhen mexico sends its people theyre not sending their best theyre not sending you theyre not sending you theyre sending people that have lots of problems and theyre bringing those problems with us theyre bringing drugs theyre bringing crime theyre rapists and some i assume are good peoplenext crowder gives the guy statistics on immigrants but admits that his statistics arent of mexican immigrants specifically for this reason they are largely irrelevant were talking about mexican immigrants here so dont bring up statistics that involve nonmexican immigrantsheres are the reasons the wall is a ridiculously stupid idea1 undocumented immigration has been in decline for 10 years2 more unauthorized mexican immigrants are returning to mexico than coming into the us3 mexicans make up only half of the undocumented immigrants so the wall is an extremely expensive attempt at solving only half of a declining problem4 a vast majority of undocumented immigrants are here due to overstaying visas the wall would only potentially stop the flow of a minority group of undocumented mexican people come from this means the wall would be an extremely expensive attempt at addressing a minority portion of only half of problem that is shrinking anyway5 if the undocumented immigrants are to be addressed there are more effective less costly less politically divisive solutions such as addressing overstayed visas but this is should only be in discussion after a very thorough costbenefit analysis
the arrogance and selective memory of americans will forever astonish me very quick to forget the massacre that took place where land was stolen from the plain indians  one of the biggest tragedies in human history and yet still have the audacity to suggest building a wall to stop more illegal immigrants from entering the territory the arguments for building a wall is simply deluded and nonfactualoh and next time please interview someone well informed on the matter
why does he talk like that holy shit its like mexican bill or ted sorry spanish
tax illegal immigrants so they are not obeying immigration law why would they obey tax law
the big problem is that ice cant deport all illegals in many cases their hands are tied by subversive local politicians how depend on illegals voting to keep them in office which is why they fight deportation they fight mandatory voter id and they actively obstruct the enforcement of existing immigration law
ok they are still going to get in one way or another is a stupid argument your saying dont bother building a wall cause it is not 100 effectice do you lock your door at night why burglars can still get in one way or another do you use birth control why you can still get pregnant using the oill condoms etc
xrays and sharks with lasers
sounds to me like she thinks the wall doesnt have gates
sante fe new mexico well that pretty much sums up spanish guy guy needs to put down the pipe lots of drugs going on in that capitol believe me when i state this fact spanish guy is right about one thing however new mexico is a sanctuary city and it absolutely houses thousands upon thousands of illegals head into albuquerques se districts youll forget youre living in the united states and think youre living in mexico
stevencrowder i need the links at 700 proving that 35 of illegal immigrants commit 37 of homicidesthe statistics are just numbers without the proof im not saying i dont belive them but i cant share them without also being asked where i got them
if borders become a thing of the past then countries will become a thing of the past
spanish guy was incredibly stupid not because he is spanish because he is stupid
we should have armed guards shooting every brown person they see at the border
blur the first womans id badge as well it would be unfortunate of someone doxxed her because they were able to get her information from it with a more in depth analysis of this video
i want to argue
open border  mexican gov is so corrupted that they dont habe anymoney for their people  and telle to their people go to the us  crazy shit 
hilarious
holy hell this is why voting should be iq restricted but to hit these retarded fucks in the hornets nest you should be doing these videos on college campuses aka marxistleftist indoctrination centers
wow new mexico is one of the worst states when it comes to education and this guy is proof not saying everybody in new mexico is stupid but the majority are like this guy i plan on becoming governor of new mexico too funny
this guy made me dizzy jeez
100 of illegal immigrants commit crimes because illegally entering the country is a crime
since border patrol is up id wait on the wall and use that money to track down illegals within the country over staying their visa getting rid of sanctuary cities and enforcing ice then when thats mostly handled do the wall
im not mexican im spanish hahahah go fuck yourself buddy hahaha you are mexican look in the mirror
trump 2020
dude is talking out of his ass
omg the spanish dude is highly deluded  he has zero historical knowledge by suggesting the world doesnt need any borders  its called chaos and anarchy but yeahhed make a great governor with his stupid ideas and complete lack of care for legal american citizens
toleral liberals lmao
this is what happens when your common sense tells you one thing but you have to repeat what you hear on the lefty msm to be part of the good crowd
solution build a canal from the gulf to the pacific and fill it with sharks and laser beams im sure the guy in the white shirt will be down for that
the guy with the white shirt is living in 2068
that spaniard is retarded af
that boy is not spaniards pinche nopal en la frente gtfo
im mexican but think about this why is it ok for mexico to have a border wall against guatemala but its immoral and wrong for the usa to have one for the same reasons its not just to stop mexicans its to stop central and south and others its a security issue not a moral issue the moral issue lies in the hands of the governments who let those people down
jajajajaja se maman puras pendejadas las que escupen todos incluyendo a steven jajajajaja
do people not realize there are already hundreds of miles of barriers along the border and thousands of people die in the desert trying to cross
well its a big waste of money honestly
funny how its mostly european caucasians that  are all in for building the wall
um donald trump totally said the majority of mexicans bring drugs into this country he also said they were rapists he said some a small percentage are good people i mean if you want to have selective hearing crowder you can have selective hearing but um you should probably pay a bit more attention to your leader
lol angry fucks shouting and passing by are the people we need to deal with in this world people should be able to have a conversations without screaming right off the bat im so glad donald trump won hillary has way to many non intellgient angry people on her side plus who know what would of happen if hillary took over w3 with russia alot of country would hate us even more which is what we do not need right now
hhey uh steven uh i think you should make an exception with that open invitation to come and talk on the show with mr leroy here please dont
is there a possibility to see a topic like atheism is good or religions are needed in modern society in change my mind in future something like that
this man went scifi
should have pixelated the first womans entire body and changed her voice slightly she was too open for her own safety
say we owe you a debt of thanks weve been circulating a post on fb entitled how to lie with statistics 101 using this very video in which you cite immigrants as responsible for 35 of murders it could be a textbook case of a person deliberately misleading with a statistic since you use federal cases the only venue where immigrants are prosecuted for murder and omit state and local where almost all murders are prosecuted thanks again for the marvelous example of using pseudo science to confirm and reinforce bigotry and ignorance good job
masked face but id card hanging around the neck being clearly visible with facial picture provided xd
wow slow change my mind day huh
we just need more masterminds problem solvedand xrays
i feel terrible for the mexican people with that being said we have a legal means to become a citizen if you break the law you you pay the price same goes for citizens every day
you should do build the wall again but in a different location maybe on a college campus in order to get more logical arguments
immigration also comes from planes and tunnels
the biggest argument ive heard against building the wall ismoney the wall is estimated to cost around 6070 billion to build and then around 150milion to staff and maintainstatistics the statistics ive seen show that most illegal immigrants dont cross the wall but that they come in via legal transportation plane train boat etc and then just overstay their welcomewont make a change say they build a 50 foot wall that will only make a demand for 51 foot ladders and a 5060 foot ropethis feels like security theater where building a wall makes people feel safer but dont actually do that much to help the problemand thats a expensive way to make the people feel a tiny bit better
i want an electronic wall  lol idiot
next change my mindconfused children should get no surgery
okay crowder first things first we agree on many things not that my opinion matters to you im sure it doesnt but we agree on many and most things the wall however no we dont the fact that our borders are not wild or fenced in any means that keeps people out allows mexican citizens to flee a country where they are literally being terrorized not figuratively being terrorized like we are by taliban and mujahideen and isis all that nonsense along the border of mexico you maybe shopping at the wrong store and get nabbed up by cartel and they very well may hold you down on the sidewalk in broad daylight in front of a gas station cut your guts out then stuff them down your throat with the plunger handled that sounds extreme but it happens every day i work with copious amounts of mexican immigrants im a construction worker theyre all legal and they all have family in mexico and horror stories let me tell you actual horror stories with that being said we lose more money to africa then we lose to mexico a wall is not going to save us a damn penny in comparison to the amount of money going to other countries you cant build a wall in the sky and you cant build a wall on the internet so the money is not going to quit flowing out of this country the amount of money lost to immigrants who are coming over here getting jobs is absolutely zero if they dont pay property tax who gives a fuck neither does anybody in florida the wall is an enormous amount of wasted money will lose more money to the construction of that wall then well lose two mexicans in a decade and this is economic factual data this is not an opinion this is real numbers that cant be argued with i personally think there are times whenever you stick to your agenda so devoutly that even though something might not make sense to you youre going to agree with it because it suits your parties wishes i say that i think you act this way because i see you as a very intelligent individual and i dont think that youre ignorant  stupid enough to actually believe that this wall is a good idea its not a good idea im educated in economics and im also educated in street smarts and world smarts i have had high paying jobs and ive lived outside the outside living was after high school for the hell of it needless to say i know how people float to this country and i know how money flows through this country and building a wall is an asinine idea

steveni think you and i would oppose each others views on almost all topics in todays political landscape that being said i have enjoyed now two of your change my mind youtube videos and have subscribed to your channelsomething that rubbed my wrong were your statistics in this video here they are countered httpswwwsnopescomfactcheckhaveundocumentedkilled63000us911 there are many counters to your claims that can be found onlinethat being said which sources are correct that would just go back and forth the problem i have is that you state your stats as fact and they are disputableit also seems that you prefer to air the more emotionally charged liberals in the crowd i could be wrong as i am not there but at a minimum you come to the table with more content preparation than the people you pull off the street that makes it very easy to prove the hidden point to your content that your mind is correct and can not be changed my assumption which you could dispute in a conversationon this topic there is no real argument here the us has always been building walls where needed across our southern border and left open space where the wall does not make sense the real argument is how dehumanizing the president and those that have followed him on this topic areanother point is its cost there are many other things in this country that the money to build the wall could go towards better roads better education in some cases better strategies to reduce illegal immigration the wall is just an ego boost for our presidentwe should not be at war with this issue there are many vulnerable people involved many if not most may be crossing our border illegally for a better life they have no other realistic option to get here and chase the american dream these peoples only crime is the location of their birth they want to work they want their children to get an education they want their children to become successful professionals why would we want to push back on that we need to put our energy in embracing it and finding a ways to legalize it not demonize itfyi i am a bernie sanders fan i argue politics with my family every chance i get we do have trump supporters and every level of involvement in those discussions i am also a teacher and my students always feel safe claiming whatever political view they have in my classroom in fact i am telling one of my conservative students about this channel today he will love it i just want to keep them thinkingi doubt either of us will change the others mind  and you will probably not even read this with so many comments if you do i would love to try to change your mind some day until them i will watch some more of your videoserik
okay crowder first things first we agree on many things not that my opinion matters to you im sure it doesnt but we agree on many and most things the wall however no we dont the fact that our borders are not wild or fenced in any means that keeps people out allows mexican citizens to flee a country where they are literally being terrorized not figuratively being terrorized like we are by taliban and mujahideen and isis all that nonsense along the border of mexico you maybe shopping at the wrong store and get nabbed up by cartel and they very well may hold you down on the sidewalk in broad daylight in front of a gas station cut your guts out then stuff them down your throat with the plunger handled that sounds extreme but it happens every day i work with copious amounts of mexican immigrants im a construction worker theyre all legal and they all have family in mexico and horror stories let me tell you actual horror stories with that being said we lose more money to africa then we lose to mexico a wall is not going to save us a damn penny in comparison to the amount of money going to other countries you cant build a wall in the sky and you cant build a wall on the internet so the money is not going to quit flowing out of this country the amount of money lost to immigrants who are coming over here getting jobs is absolutely zero if they dont pay property tax who gives a fuck neither does anybody in florida the wall is an enormous amount of wasted money will lose more money to the construction of that wall then well lose two mexicans in a decade and this is economic factual data this is not an opinion this is real numbers that cant be argued with i personally think there are times whenever you stick to your agenda so devoutly that even though something might not make sense to you youre going to agree with it because it suits your parties wishes i say that i think you act this way because i see you as a very intelligent individual and i dont think that youre ignorant  stupid enough to actually believe that this wall is a good idea its not a good idea im educated in economics and im also educated in street smarts and world smarts i have had high paying jobs and ive lived outside the outside living was after high school for the hell of it needless to say i know how people float to this country and i know how money flows through this country and building a wall is an asinine idea
the guy in the white shirt who is obviously mexican or some type of hispanic whos roots are from central america is a fuckin idiot
so he wants to forcibly implant illegals good or bad with rfids people you cant find or know are illegal as they cross the border without coming through the terminal as you do a man hunt for those illegals 44 people die of drug overdoses while you try find and tag them like animals force them to do a test to conform and register them then finally hope they comply with taxationmeanwhile we treat the illegals who arent criminals like animals so when they want to cross the border your xray scanner comes to the rescue to alert authorities that a registered tagged legal is over the border going to a birthday party meanwhile actual illegals who arent caught and tagged like dogs still cross the xray scanner unnoticed to commit we crimes they want or need to survive until they too are caught and tagged like dogsa whole 3 years thinking about damn we should vote for him thengood luck with that future governor
please offer a very simple i q test before talking to people
if borders are gone in the future no laws could be enforced unless we set up a global law system
to have a gate you need a wallfence
when this guy said xray scanner he lost all chances of changing his mind
a world without borders is a scary thought  reminds me of the ideal of communism getting rid of the bourgeois so the proletariat may have their fare share  only if we are angels will either scenario work  a border of surveillance is more pragmatic as our technology continues to develop  the ability to scan people suggests an implant and one not easily removed  a scary thought and unconstitutional i think  i agree with the young man that what we need is both security and freedom quite a paradox but not contradictory  historically first generation immigrants can be more of a burden to their adopted society but their children and grandchildren become that society to the point that they no longer speak their mother tongueive often thought thats a shame as language is such a potent cultural conveyor  so its ironic that i left miami in part for that very reason long after i watched the white flight of 95 of my neighbors  i took spanish lessons and three years of it in school but refused to learn it though i didnt realize  if i am a drink i would say im milk and the cubans are orange juice add a drop occasionally to the milk and i still have milk  but too much and the milk curdles  finally there is no milkonly tangy orange juice  a law was being proposed that a basic english test must be passed to obtain a drivers license  i did not agree with it at the time as i knew english was not necessary to be a responsible driver  but that wasnt what its about  some feel its our just reward that the white man is loosing his grip  we dont need a wall with 1st world canada but 3rd world mexico  whatever future transitions occur i dearly hope we can be reasonable and heed  cool heads who intelligently articulate instead of hot heads full of reaction and insults  society is like a chemical reaction too much heat and it becomes unstable  i know its not perfect but lets not throw out the baby with the bath water
holy shithow do you do it i know you were about to lose your shit that entire time you talked to that poor kidhes hopelessly clueless
this dude is proposing rfid chips to track humans where ever they are
what the actual hellbuilding a wall  badmass surveillance  good 
talk to people who know something
just have a wall of armed guards to shoot anyone who approaches
again the statistics are great but realize that he said 60 odd percent of murders are by illegal immigrants but its because of he high of a percent of latinos thee are in the us also but unfortunately latinos bro a wall isnt going to stop no one
i dont know like the proper scientifical ray that is used but like an xrayi freaking love this guy
this fine young gentleman was so stupid it actually hurt my head
this x ray guy watch too much movie how can u x ray a person if he doesnt have a number as a legal american citizen clearly you have to put a number on him otherwise you would lose him if u can where would you do it on the street which streetsthats why you need border so u know clearly where u would do your future xray oh my god i feel foolish talking about this this is why you dont watch too much movie kidsu need to come back to reality
one thing the allovertheplacevlogger is right about is the constant flow of people moving places and the us is the place for world citizens
the wall is a retarded ideeamost illegal immigrants arrive via planes and stay in the country until their visa expiresthe fuck man thats billions of dollars wastednot to mention it would go trough hillsmountainshouses and etchow the fuck do you think the wall workswhy not just modify the visaswhy not improve border laws or border patrolsthe wall is just a terrible fucking ideea
we need to build an xray wall al the undocumented gamma waves are coming in through the border
latinos for trump
xray border lmao
he is describing everify which the right has suggested for years and years and the left and thrown down as racist for years and years
i think they should have a way to have hard working illegal immigrants who dont have a criminal record a chance to be legal and those with a small criminal record they need to do something to help the country so they can be legal because most of these immigrants come to america just to support their families and for the ones who are like drug lords and stuff or really harm the country they should be deported and most of those innocent immigrants who care about their families so much they risk their lives for their families and they should be able to be legal
build the wall with your ass bitchgo figure a liberal who doesnt know how building something works workshopliberal arts 
im surprised youre in favor of the wall do you know how expensive its going to be immigrants are going to get under it or over it regardless theyll find a way the great wall of china didnt stop the mongols from invading just slowed them down a bit the wall in israel didnt stop suicide bombers from coming in underground it just slowed them down a bit so its going to be very expensive to build something that isnt going to do much of anything but its bad for the environment and animal migration majority of illegals coming in here are honest and want to work its the bad guys who make them look bad yet theyll have sources to get around the wall better than peaceful people theyll likely profit as coyotes by charging the peaceful people and the american police will likely get bribed by them sort of like during the alcohol prohibition there will most likely be an underground pass built and who is going to be running it the cartels the bad guys see how this isnt a solution for honest people to attempt to do things legally but an instigation for illegal profitsas someone who is against abortion i find it ironic youre in favor of this wall youre a smart man but some of your stance on issues are ridiculous and hypocritical
god is laughing at nwo globalists the nwo will start when christ returns not until then god supports nationalism not globalism he has slapped down the nwo many times in recent history wwi wwii and in bible times the tower of babel he is doing it again to protect us this nwo leadership is evil and will exterminate millions thats their plan not happening midterms will be end of demonrats and rinos are leaving wwg1wga
that was the dumbest brown guy  in the word lol
the xray wall guy is dumb as fuck
im against the wall cuz of what the lady was trying to say they are gonna come one way or another and it would be a waste of money they gotta find another way to fight illegal immigration
check out he meme at 122 httpsyoutube0ptkzv8w1ic
im against the wall but im even more against tagging people like animals to be tracked like that
i think the beginning was kind of  dangerous to her wellbeing the blur in her face is not a definite guarantee to hide her identity maybe could have just audio clipped it or done a better job of censoring her
that look at the end hahahaha
everyone who is against the wall is a supporter of illegal immigration build the wall trump i support you from haiti
this is hurting my brain build that bitch and throw those dummies over it too
this dude in the white is living in the future
so basically the guys argument for legalizing the illegal immigrants is so that they can be exploited through taxation he wants more people paying taxes so he can get his fat government check dudes a selfish ass and the more likely scenario is that there will be just as many moochers as contributors resulting in a minimal net gain to the system
before 1920 all the immigration to us was legal during the 19 century us saw the most rapid economic growth of it all history as milton friedman said you want free market for others but for yourself you want the help of the government
that redskin in the white shirt got dropped on his head when he was a baby
omg so effing new mexican
steven i have mad respect for you that spanish guy was out of his damn mind if i was your producer i would have asked him to kindly get up and get the f out of there and as erratic as he was speaking i quite possibly would have called law enforcement on him he sounded geeked out of his mind
gaah i know many who are illegal and get away with crapand no illegals who do work using with itin or using someone elses ss number dont reap any benefits at tax time they receive no  from returns soyes they do get taxed indirectly the system is broken and corrupt
i kind of felt bad for how stupid that guy is im not being mean i genuinely feel bad for him poor guy
fix the immigration and citizenship process quicker background checks no wall waste of money but have some sort of border control like we have now all immigrants should be documented via visa or other methods only deport the criminals but people with a clean hardworking background that pays taxes should be kept in the usa
broo  this is borderline propaganda why are you interviewing dummies on the topic  making people with the opposite stance look naive  im unimpressed
im against the wall because its ineffective and cost prohibitive  a better way to stop illegal immigration would be though mandatory everify imprisoning employers who employ illegal immigrants by charging under the rico act as well as better monitoring the border with drones and more agents that can quickly respond to illegal entry
funny how they say illegals are paying smugglers 10 grand to get here but coming here the right way legally costs about that much so just do it the right way money talks
your face was priceless xd
to be honest i feel like alot of people dont have a problem with enforcing the border control but the physical form of a wall is what scares people a wall isnt exactly associated with good things such like north korea or even the origin of the great wall of china id say its the message that the wall sends to the world about the us that isnt the best
im not mexican im spanish from mexico or something
has his mind ever been changed just curious and if so please let me know which video it occurs in
do you think we should recycle
that second guy was on crack
can you please do a racism is rare  change my mind
lost me at xray wall lost steven too i think future governor of new mexico
this dude thinks there will be no borders in 5 or 10 years  ha yeah why even listen further 
i simply watch this channel because i believe its a good idea to listen to other viewpoints and opinions ive watched most or all of the other change my mind videos and there was at least some semblance of an argument from steven crowder but not in this one hes incredibly misinformed and seems to pick only the stupidest people he can find because he knows his point is so weak im not going to comment on the laws surrounding immigration but the actual physical wall is the worst way to stop illegal immigration if youre looking at preventing drugs or illegal immigrants entering the country dont build a wall upwards of 8085 of drugs enter the united states through air or sea and most illegal immigrants come here legally but just overstay their visa neither of which the wall would prevent the wall will be billions and billions of dollars wasted while not solving anything the only thing a thirtyfoothigh wall will do is create a market for 31foot ladders
with no borders whats to keep the russianchinese global cartels  military  from infiltrating the us  these people are the problem with this changing country built by immigrants my ass  mixed  pernicious tribal behaviors like this are tearing this country apart 
i think the wall is probably not going to work this is because there are real ways to stop illegal immigration and no methods are being  carried out to that end we dont even enforce immigration laws that exist now first of all a tough stance on immigration needs to exist the will needs to exist to get them out  here are my ideas 1 have a shoot to kill policy at the border wed only have to kill a few to get the message across very seriously itd be such a good a deterrent  second we need to make it impossible for them to exist here make laws which make it mandatory to prove citizenship to go to the hospital to have a drivers license to get any assistance whatsoever make citizenship a law to get a job fine employers massively for employing illegals if you take the incentive for them to want to be here they wont come make living here anathema to non citizens make state sponsored anti mexican propaganda make policies which grant monetary rewards for people who report illegals we can get a lot more creative and effective than a wall im not wholly opposed to a wall either but a wall alone without a serious change of sentiment and policy is almost worthless theyll tunnel theyll climb  if we have a wall it needs to be really strong high deep into the ground and electrified it should be like israels with armed men or remotely operated or ai weapons systems and or a full time staff of soldiers with orders to shoot to kill our immigration issue would end real quick id also like to see armed round ups of the illegal aliens who are already here put them on cattle cars and ship them the hell out
i have a brilliant idea so hear me out i think that we should change all houses and instead of having a door have an xray so when people want to come in and out of our house they will be asked why they are coming in and out it will be genius it will stop all house robberies  and any house in the world will be like this it will be like an oasis this will stop all people entering that arent wanted too because people will follow the rules  insert sarcasm here
you state that they commit disproportionate amounts of crime but thats false httpswwwwashingtonpostcomnewswonkwp20180619twochartsdemolishthenotionthatimmigrantshereillegallycommitmorecrimeutmtermd7dc194e947c
lol these folks have no idea
where did you get statistics on the crime rates for immigration
lmao what was that dude on if he ever become gov of new mexico then im positive our world will become the movie idiocracy he contradicted alot of what he said
i dont like illegal immigration but a wall wont do any good this is not ancient china or rome
haaa he sounds like a special democrab
just make em pass the test
my family has been in new mexico since 1550we just ignoring that stevie
what a waste of everyones time
wow that dude is totally clueless
you should make another one because these arguemrnts were very weak
as a new mexican i would like to make the claim that this guy does not accurately represent the state at large
please do white privedge i know you did male privledge byt we need white to be done too
ugh why is he wearing short shorts with long sleeve shirt
the problem is the wall would cost hundreds of millions of dollarsalso most illegals come here on greencards and overstay its sad that the talkers dont know that change my mind
do a  trump isnt a liar  or trump doesnt have an ego
peopleaare gettinga dumberaby the daya
we are in the age of idiocracy may god have mercy on these ignorant people and our future generation
this dude watches too much tv and scifi crap
yup the dude from new mexico is an idiot he has zero understanding
the most surprising thing in this change my mind was seeing steven in shorts
what percent of illegal immigrants commit crimes 100 of them because they broke the law when they entered the country illegally
i can see the iq skyrocket for california in the next couple years such individual makes us so so more intelligent
do a waters not wet change my mind lol like if you agree
this guy is fuckng mexican
i am completely for the wall
where the fuck did yall even set up
can somebody fact check this animal crowder
crowder mustve felt like ida when fighting hatsume in the ua sports festival
are there any decent alternatives to building the wall
635 crowder says illegal immigrants commit 37 of the homicides what statistic is he citing there because that doesnt sound right at all is he lying
what a dumbass the kid didnt finnish high  school
for the first time i disagree with this guy i agree with people coming as long as they have the money know english and have a clean criminal record if they have these things they should be automatically be able to come in here and if they come here hew come illegally are just used for hard manual labor with little pay so it is better if they come legally and i guess the illegal ones  do the least crimes for the fear of being deported
why doesnt he ever interviewed people with good arguments i feel like he only picks parts where people dont make strong arguments its kinda biased seen so many of his videos and not one of them has a good point or knows how to get their point across correctly
lets get this straight people there is already a fence a shitty fence that doesnt cover the entire border that fence was built to defend the border of our country to foreign invaders nobody seems to have a problem with it rightly so it was built to do a job that we hopefully all agree with except the illegal immigrants of course who want to come into our country without going through the legal way these people are already committing a crime by coming here illegally building a more efficient barrier to protect our border is a great idea its not racist to defend your countrys borders wanting to keep illegal potentially violent trespassers out of our country is not racist renovating and replacing an old fence with a more effective wall is not racist please get your head out of the toilet morons
if you dont get any quality guestsopinions you shouldnt post a video this was just a waste of everyones time
i feel like more energy should be spent helping reduce corruption and drug cartels in mexico and help them to bring growth to their economy so that these potential immigrants 1 feel safe and 2 have a sense of upward mobility  path to prosperity i dont think they want to leave their home if they can help it i think addressing these root issues are an important piece that will help reduce the load of illegal immigration instead of just attacking the issue one way by building an expensive wall which may or may not be effectivethough i am for border security i wonder if a wall will actually stop people from digging underclimbing overgetting around it this is a good conversation to have
i dont know how steven kept a straight face listening to that dude bullshitting his way through this haha
is school we learn soviet union builds walls and spreads propaganda look who is going that nao
the guy was a coke head u can spot from a mile away
they already have xray machines at the border i work for a company that builds the housings for them we build them second hand i believe the company that uses them is american science  engineering ase they are big enough for semi trucks to drive though them and no they dont work like the guy in the white shirt was talking
holyfs x ray boy wants to be gov of nmhasnt that state suffered enough
anybody cares to provide a link to data substantiating the claim illegal immigrants commit crimes at a disproportionate ratealso trump said  some illegal immigrants are good people clearly insinuating most of them are dangerous conservatives also claim they are only against illegal immigration but they want to do away with chain migration and the green card lottery which is legal immigration would respect you more if you were more intellectually honest about thatand finally the plan was for mexico to pay for the wall not the taxpayer youre not gonna get that wall i think its time to come to term with itjust enjoy the fence
sir that man was a dumbass
guy in the white shirt leroy should choose another profession he is clueless i thought he was going to talk about cyborgs as border patrol next 
we cant build a wall on the mexican side of the rio grande river and we cant build a wall down the property line which generally snakes back and forth near the middle of the rio grande river so i guess were going to build it on our side when we are ready to give away our access to the rio grande river and have an extra 25 billion laying around with no better usebig walls are a profoundly stupid ideas when it comes to international bordersconsider the two most famous walls in historyin the long run the great wall in china is a little more than a tourist attraction illustrating how incredible amounts of construction resources can be wasted imagine if those stones couldve been used to build permanent waterways structures and roads in beijing the chinese could have had a great tourist attraction and a great contribution to the civilizationthe berlin wall is the wall of shame in history all but small portions totally removed except for the pieces left standing to remind us of its stupidity as well in the long run the berlin wall did nothing more than economically suppress the soviet occupied part of berlin while the westernized side of berlin prospered even now 70 years later one can see that the cordoned off portion of that great city was economically and culturally penalized through no fault of their ownnonetheless trump wants his own monument to waste and stupidity so he can go down in history like an ancient myopic chinese dynasty or a failed communist empire and all because of a lame campaign promise made to his shrinking minority base within a troubled republican partytrump has already made his mark on history we already have a president with the lowest of approval ratings who is rated dead last amongst presidents by modern historians but that doesnt seem to be good enough for trump because he wants to leave a permanent scar on the earthbut i dont think we need a structure carving off the rio grande river from the bottom of the texas and handing it back to the mexicans we fought pretty hard for the land between the nueces and the rio grande in the mexican american war of 1845 which via the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo which was the culmination of one of the biggest land expansions in the history of the world seems pretty stupid to cut off our own access to the river that drains from colorado and new mexico so that mexico can have the sole access to those waters not to mention all the eminent domain confiscation of land that adjoins that boundary devastating some of the most fertile farmland in the countryif the stupid wall ever gets built we will be motivated to pump out all the water before it reaches el paso creating a 1000 mile long dry ditch and creating new saharalike desert on both sides of the wall visible from space indeed trump would then have made his mark handing whats left of a great river along with land from our side back to the mexicans with a 25 billion structure that might as well have signs on their side that read youre welcome
1027 and youve lost me lol
i see what he means  why make the mexicans illegal if you can just add them legally to the workforce and government taxation  guess what if they were legally added to the work force they would be recognized as extremely underpaid  that their working hours aught to be illegal the mexican culture on this side of the border is so afraid of the government that it is afraid to defend itself sometimes opting for self reliance or profiteers who take advantage of immigratory situations with false advertisements and fear mongering ads that pass by mouth  electronics are merely one form of communication
the guy from new mexico basically said we need some form of documentation just not the one we have now hajaha
a physical wall is a waste of resources most illegals dont just strut across the boarder  they overstay visas  dig tunnels boats etc dont waste money on a wall
can i be against illegal immigration and be against a physical wall at the same time  it seems like a yuge waste of moneywhat can we do to make them not want to come here and if they are already here leave voluntarily
how many red bulls did that guy slam before sitting down 
seriously prosecute and fine americans that hire undocumented workers change my mind
xrays bad idea
this wasnt even entertaining lost a couple of brain cells while watching the white shirt guy
the last guy has no idea what he is talking about
is there an episode of this where someone actually changes his mind
he mentioned a gate what are gates attached to a wall
build the wall deport them allliberals can join them in mexico if they want well fling them over the wall
i would never elect that man to governorship he was wacked

wow build the wall change your stupid retarded mind to stop legal immigration
you dont know what he talking about he needs to go to school
this guy dont know what hes talking about drugs
this guy really said xray scanner wall we aint that far into the future bruh
build the xray wall
this will change your mind now i havnt got the time to pull up the specific statistics however the reason you should not build the wall is because it would make no difference im pretty sure in the different ways illegal immagrints can pass the border in the ground is the least popular way correct me if im wrong but immagrints that are illegal normally get across the border on holiday then overstay their welcome im not against stopping illegal immagrints im against spending billions of dollars on something that is not going to make a difference like any other illegal act people are going to find a way around it its fact if you disagree with that you need to see a doctor i think what america has in place is good enough except some very particular things that im not aware of but will be discovered in the future there is so much more to say however its late for me and would like sleep feel free to oppose and i will reply when i can many thanks and would love to do something like this in the uk its great
the guy in t shirt needs to finish high schoollol
that second guy is the exact reason why we should build the wall
the kid from new mexico has seen to much anime
goto there are only 2 genders 2nd edition change my mind this is one of steves more enjoyable programs while both these individuals may have lived trans lives steve is surprisingly knowledgeable about the current state of misinformation being fed to students by useless gender studies departments fortunately many of the useless courses in the humanity and sociology departments will cease to exist within an estimated five years thanks to jordan b petersons recent initiative to cleanse universities and colleges of marxist related courses and professors  donations toward dr petersons initiative and the republican partys election in november will go a long way toward lowering the cost of and cleansing of our education system and the msm
do another one this discussion needs to go on especially with whats been happening right now
i beg you come over to england and do these
do veganism in sacramento
this guy is against a wall and a border control but for an xray border and absolute surveillance in the city how isnt that way worse for the freedom of people oo
this wall agenda is total bullshit and a complete waste of money
how the fuck are you suppose to tax someone without a social security number
my dude is on some shit hahah
what about the berlin wall
on behalf on latinos and hispanics everywhere i would like to apologize for the 2nd guy his ideas come from a good place but hes clueless on the simple details that would make them work
the american people the woman says at 100  at least she knows she is not the american people
this was too retarded to finish
there is one benefit of the wall that no one talks about the flow of american guns into mexico
if the guy from new mexico has more than zero people listening to his podcast our video that tells me that were in trouble what a moron
how many brain cells did i just loose
the second person you spoke to is unbelievably ineloquent emotionaly charged and has no ability to grapple with statistics surely you must have spoken to somebody who could actually get their point acrossshow us that
is this guy high 
nigga how u a canadian french pussy nigga that immigrated to the us at 18 how u finna say build the wallget the strap
nigga how u a canadian french pussy nigga that immigrated to the us at 18 how u finna say build the wallget the strap
california economic success totally dependent on illegal low paid workers  no tax no rights max profits
dreamers have no answers only dreams
wait a sec so 37 of murder is committed by illegal immigrants and about half of all murders in the us are commit by black men how much do these two groups overlap
stevencrowder you should reattempt this same cmm sometime and somewhere down the line
look at the wholt picture here the dealers wont sell here if the americans stop buying from them trumps put the blame on them when we are the ones causing all this to happen fuck the wall lets help the americans get off of durgs and stop buying form mexico if we ant buying then they ant selling  problem solved
the problem isnt solved by making a border the problem is solved by taking mexico out of the equation and slowly converting it to the united states so that we can freely apply our security methods teachings and restrictions just respect their culture and itll be fine keep their own president so that their vote matters both presidents can veto legislation and both must agree to pass laws
i come from the future and yes hes the governor of new mexico now
do black people can be rascit change my mind
build a wall  so what happens if mexico builds a tunnel  this guy is a walking contradiction  god fearing human who wants to build a wall to his fellow human  love thy neighbour
biggest argument i heard was obamas you have this long to claim your illegal immigration and get granted eligibility for citizenship and if you dont youre deported that takes care of the criminals and the good immigrants then build all the wall you want
the guy in the white shirt wtf is wrong with him
wow those were the most uneducated rebuttals to the border wall yet that spanish guy made himself look completely inept at rational thought
it was funny to me how the guy said we dont need borders and everything should be free flowing then says that everyone in the world needs to be micro chipped so we can track when they cross the border
stevens face at the end 
you should do a change my mind on the topic of girls joining boyscouts because i feel like that is a big topic right now and people have a lot of different opinions
his assumption is that all illegal immigrants cross the border at border security checkpoints most dont they come on boats swim or walk across
i have a pain in my chest from listening to that guys incoherent rhetoric
that guy makes a great case why legalizing pot is bad either he is high or retarded
the proper scientifical ray
this guy wants to tag people like the nazis tagged jews wow
theoret1cal pfft yeah right
illegal entry hurts that country and people tremendous its common sense
anthony perez yeah sounds a bit much
jonathan portillo he wants to adapt immigration technology from his planet on earth
a large wall is not very reasonable considering the scale it would also not do much to really stop illegal immigration considering that most illegals come in on planes but i dont think illegal immigration should be a thing at all because i dont really believe in borders say it is because i dont understand it enough i probably dont so im not gonna pretend i just dont see it as necessary to keep people out who want to be here
just declare illegal immigration as a threat to the country and shoot any illegals if illegals start getting shot most will not want to try but then again lots of illegals come in as a visiter and just stay
why should anyone change his mind who gives 2  what he thinks
hes an idiout lol
i learned that there are alot of people out there that think that the wall is bad however still dont want illegal immigration the wall is only to keep out illegals though so this really confuses me people whos only education on the wall was that it was to keep mexicans out when really u can still get in legally but it just keeps illegals out
this hispanic dude has the most add ive seen in one human being before lel
1106 umm so you want a border
i lowkey want to fight you
free flowing uh they shouldnt be deported uh his talking is annoying
this video shows how fucked up everything is we have a mexican woman who is terrified of some illegal immigrants in her neighborhood and wants them deported and needs help figuring out how to report themand then we have some doofus against the wall that proposes something way more invasive than a border wall you want to scan people coming and going and scan them again in the city to make sure they are doing what they claimed hes also living in a futuristic fantasyland i mean seriously i wonder if not many people trying to change your mind means that most people there agreed with the wall
the kid is dumb hire me ill give you a good debate
that mexican dude yeah hes a mexican is a millennial snowflake who has no grasp of realityedit  after watching him a bit more hes definitely mentally unstable and living in a fantasy dreamworld xray gates lmfao 
so in order to leave the country to need to be screened for a passport thats just to travel so if you are coming to live here shouldnt you have to be fully screened
stevencrowder what is the main reason for you to think that no borders wont work in the united states when they do work in western europe
rfid  tags  i like them and we could use them for things like iddrive license and insurance one card all you need if you get into trouble  but that guy from new mexico is not using his brain
it all comes down to getting people to come through one entrance so they know whos coming in and out which is fair enough because by their logic illegals might aswell walk into legal citizens homes and make themselves comfy cant tell them to go cause thats being harsh get outta here 
i love the random unrehearsed structure of these but he interviews such morons which makes me worried that moron seems to be the norm 
i think they will just use a plane if we build a wall change my mind 
white shirt dude is just laughable
the guy in the white shirt is the reason you need borders
3 of the population illegal immigrants commit 37 of all the murders in this country that is physically fucking impossible this guys a fucking liar
the guy from new mexico is an alien
847 huh
a scientifical immigrantuh xray thinguh  this could solve all out immigration problems
who needs a concretesteel wall when you can make one out of deadly radiation this man is a genius
instudio one on one with usef make it happen
perfect question for the open borders crowd  does your home or apartment have a door and walls  why and whats the point of that
love the walther shirt   my mind went numb listening to that guy  travel fast and cheap anywhere in 5 to 10 years  smh  he really has no understanding of the world
females are way more privileged they can pretty much get away with murder do an episode on that p  that should be fun
i think the type of xrays this guy means is the far reaching gama rays you know you need the powerful ones to reach across the border who knows maybe it will even penetrate the ground and scan the people in tunnels lol
you should have cut the video for the poor x ray border guy he is confused clearly lolol
your confused that state is often in reference with african americans
louder crowder ill call your statistics on violent crime are wrong
ive never heard a good argument against the wall and i would like to hear a good argument against the wall
his stat on violent crime is wrong im not liberal but that is the stat for african americans cant play if you got your facts wrong but i agree not everyone can come here but his statistics are wrong on crime hes talking out of his ass
i just hope he can finally get all of the scientifical facts together and send steven that email and discuss the general idea of xray scanners a bit more in depth holy ht this country is in trouble
i think truly the only reason he extended the conversation of this male in the white shirt is only because he is so very entertained like i really tried so hard to understand how or what he was saying or keep up with which topic he was talking about with out switching to another like wow very very every where god
so have an rfid chip scanner network across the whole border a wall with checkpoints along it would be cheaper
if the wall gets funded and volunteers are needed at some point id drop whatever i was doing and work on it for free at this point
yeah but majority of mexicans take us dollars and some down to mexico illegally
maybe the wall was inside of us all along
obviously better preferably no lethal border control is a necessity that being said a wall is a terrible idea because itsunbelievably expensive throughout his campaign trumps estimate went front 616 billion with safer estimates including bridges land terraforming and reposition bring closes to 3040 billion further more theres a general rule with defensive walls like this which is that you have to pay their full price again every 40 odd years to maintain themit wont stop illegal immigration about 4060 if illegal immigration come via plane and its quite silly to think that these extremely desperate people wont find away over it as soon as its their only option this is a nation where people build their homes they can build a ladder and ropeit wont stop drug trafficking drugs are already transpired in their majority over the border fence using a catapult throughout history the harder you make it to transport drugs the price higher the price goes and demand remains constant the increase in funding results in stronger less safe drugs more powerfull drug cartels and im sure if need be little rockets to get drugs over a wall too high to catapultnot to say i have a catch all answer but unmanned drones frequent car patrols and more financially accessibly citizenship accusition would be a decent start and we all know america already had the military budget for it
build the wall with the bodies of illegals like 300 style
i need to get together with some masterminds to talk this outyea hes definitely not one of them
building a wall is an obvious solution but listening to the opposition makes it even more obvious understand that mr crowder represents a trump voter and the man in the white tshirt represents a hillary or sanders supporter enough said
he wants to be the governor of new mexico   i want to be on the pga tour   but its not going to happen
my man leroy is living in the future electronic tags sensors to id said tags in cities and on the boarder hed be a hit in germany 19191933
i like the idea of your change my mind segments but its clear you have no intention of having your mind changed if you actually did ever change your mind you would probably lose followers also id like to see you go debate a civil rights lawyer or professor rather than just trying to pick people off the street you can easily dominate in debate furthermore if youre going to spout off statistics at least provide your source or put them in the video description i tried looking up the illegal immigrants commit 37 of the homocides in the us and i cannot find that statistic anywhere
raise your hand if you dont do drugs not so fast spainiard
there needs to be a word for people who take a position that sounds dangerous but is actually perfectly safe and requires no bravery at all and one where you will never have to eat crow bc the reality wont come home to roost until a hundred years from now like people who confront cops as oppose to confronting actual criminalsthugs or people who say no borders knowing they will never have to live in that world and can kick back and enjoy living in a majority white ethno state where its safe to preach about a world where there are no longer any white people
x ray wall 
and in this world with no borders where would the check points be located
lol
ha ha he doesnt know what statistically means it sounds like he thinks its a word you use to draw especial attention to your point
this guy sums up the left perfectly ignorant stupid emotional and hypocritical he doesnt have one single point that holds validity crowder has a lot of patience to not just throw his arms up and scream youre an idiot
build a wall with your asschallenge accepted
what a stupid mexican he should be placed under the wall for a strong foundation
i love most of your videos however the wall wont do shit waste of taxpayers money
dumb show
that dude needs either ritalin or adderall and books lots and lots of books
we are now putting a wall up between not only mexico and the united states but between new mexico too
xray scanner what an idiot
lets just make a wall as big as the dubai towers and call it a day
you have to have people on the border anyway people can just climb over the wall it doesnt work without people i guess people already patrol there lets keep that
what bullsht  this young  man is confused a  high percentage of illegals  are here just to milk the system work under the table paying no taxes while driving their escalade and sending thousands of dollars each week back home  never wanting to become a citizen it is an invasion  intended to break the system nothing less crazy thing is mexico  already built a wall on their south boarder to slow down  illegals coming in why cant we have one also to  do the same thing on our south boarder their invasion is costing us citizens trillions of dollars  every year   when we deport the illegals seize all their  property in forfeiture  to partially pay for immigration services  we got to get tough  on illegals or it will break this country down beyond repair then no one will have anything  then we will hear that huge sucking sound of all the illegals leaving because the free  ride  will be over
i agree with the mexican lady its not going to stop them so why build it   i am against illegal immigration but why spend so much tax payer money on something that will only prevent a percentage of illegal immigration from mexico  it is a complete waste of money there are several ways that money could be used more productively
too short
the earth is an oblate spheroid change my mind
this change my mind is not very good because the first two people are so stupid that it is hard to listen to them the problem the us has on every issue is that stupid people are easy to manipulate like the fool im listening too now cant even articulate a logical sentence and he claims hes going to be governor and because he is stupid he has a better chance of being governor
the new elon musk lol 1028
the wall is a barrier that will force them to find another avenue to try to sneak in  once they try to go around you start plugging the other holes in the system  wall gets built and then we need to throw these dumb motherfuckers over it who want to destroy america by leaving it open for just anybody to walk in
this guy wants to give people the mark of the beast
ibm rfid commercial
build the xray gate 2018
thank god you did this one especially that first lady she reminded me of my mother sad situation thank you for this segment truly thank you
the last guy has seen to many scifi movies
crowders face at the end is priceless like what
did anyone ask for the wall to come down
this guy is obviously not spaniard for supposedly being a several generation american he sure talks like he just crossed im a first generation american and some people think im white when we talk on the phone i believe in fairness for any person who is willing to leave their country family traditions and children  behind to take a leap of faith and risk their lives to give their children a better life live in a distant land with people that want you out and treat you like dirt work hard every day to make an honest living  ill give to the fact that not all immigrants are the same but neither are us citizens
ha that spanish guy just proposed the most totalitarian system to track the movement of people far worse that a freaking wall
why didnt you become a lawyer
where does crowder get his sources from  i wasnt able to find anything that said illegals commit 37 of crimes all i found was a bunch of articles saying its bs lol
the guys proposal is ridiculous burden the system with a limitless number of migrants and then tax them to support the burdened system
1316 priceless
scientifical
let me just get the fucking x ray vision ass walls here boys
how about you redo this issue on a college campus where there are educated students that can have a shot of actually changing your mind instead of popping up on a street corner come to usc and ill gladly change it for you
never heard anyone speak english with a glottal stop at the end of their sentences the guy from new mexico was against the wall unknowingly is for it as steve exposed him
u talked to a crazy lady and a guy with down syndrome
build the wall with your ass bitchmy cheeks dont have that kind of muscle my guy
an xray scanner as you cross the us mexican border maaaan we are peasants in 2018 while hes in the 2050s for gods sake
was i just called a cheap prick for only watching him on youtubebecause honey if this is the quality of your content im not spending my money on more byeeee
this one sucks i like to watch videos where the argument is somewhat good this guy just shot hot air out of his mouth to say nothing
anyone else getting tired of this guy dude is not open to having his mind changed lol
lmao when that guy was right about the drug war you had to get him out of there
watch larken rose debate lauren southern regarding immigration and the wall great debate
penn  teller bullsht do a great job in dismantling the wall argument
i think you should do the wall thing again but with smarter people
you should pay for it build a wall that wont work what a douche
skip to 1314 and watch till 1318 for a summary of the video for those who havent watched it yet
614 noncitzens do commit a few crimes at a higher rate than citizens but to just say crimes in general is not accurate at all murder manslaughter sex abuse robbery assault drug trafficking breaking and entering and auto theft are all far more likely to be committed by us citizens are noncitizens committing a disproportionate amount of crime given what a small percentage of the county they make up in some categories possibly yes but the narrative that noncitizens are committing more crimes than citizens is false in almost every category of crime dont believe me look it up yourself httpsisbusscgovlogin
that guy is high af good luck with being a governor retard
oh man one thing i never get tired of is trump derangement syndrome most people think its beyond annoying because people flip shit about every little thing trump does says or enforces regardless of who actually started the policy but i think its hilarious these  hecklers are just amusing to me i know its cliched to say this at this point but it is reality these people seem absolutely incapable forming fact based logically sound arguments its always high emotion and vitriol yes i do have a dark sense of humor i know
x ray border lol more free flowing lol  ummmm how about just a wall
this is complete bullshit and should be called ill try and change your mind
he wants to put a chip in them
come on steven find better people to interview
that dude was so disoriented the whole conversation
youre a disingenuous joke  of course youll get silly responses when you pick and choose which conversations you air  also why not debate people who could also prepare for the debate on the matter ahead of time  you know like most debates  you go for the easiest targets like a cowardrandom people passing by who didnt know this topic was about to be debated  not to mention youre not actually interested in having your mind changed you just put on an openminded act  its pathetic  even when the other person has you in a corner you just change the subject and squirrel away
building an actual physical wall is nonsense the money could be use to create better anti illegal inmigrations projects with the region neighbors joint efforts where everyone wins most inmigrants do it because they want to work and get fairly paid so there could be a program between countries where they can offer qualified worker for a season the us company will be in charge of salary and safety of the worker and the worker will abaid to the laws and taxation of the us at the same time the country of origin of the worker will be in charge of the insurance and mobilization of the workers in that way everyone wins the employer gets the job done the us gov receive tax and money flows in to the us economy plus the employer nor the us gov has to carry with social security expenses the origin country receive tax and money flows in to the local economy and the inmigrats has the incentive to safely go to work and return to their family and culture then again an actual wall would be as effective as a trench or razor wire or a canal full of sharks with lazer beam attached to their freaking heads without mentioning  waaay more expensive
who programs the illegals into this giant xray system does everyone south of the border just get programmed at birth to enter the us illegally
felt kinda sorry for the first lady
this dude from new mexico is describing some serious big brother shit 
trump is better than hillarychange my mind
guy is born in the us and has such a thick accent he is clueless about what is going on 3 of population illegal aliens commit 40 of the murders and he said yes but who sells the drugs us citizens
do the people who sit down realize how stupid they are
source on illegal immigrants being responsible for 6070 of drug trafficking 3040 of homicides etc genuinely interested i had no idea it was that high
dumbass
im embarrassed for the guy in the white shirt   steven you need to get more intellectual people to talk to you about this subject
sad how most young people are so stupid and inarticulate it hurts my brain
i love your show and agree with you on pretty much everything but i disagree on this one a physical wall will not stop the bad illegal immigrants from coming over most of them fly over i think that what  the spanish guy was saying is right in the sense of make it easier to come here and work but what he was saying is a wall a digital wall so he is not right but back to my point make it easier to come and work but ship your ass home no camps and stuff just you dont be long here goodbye but a physical wall is not going to stop the cartels and the real problem people they have the money to bypass a wall
1 being born within us borders alone should not make you a citizen i believe you should need at least one parent who is a citizen currently living within the country and to also be born on us soil2 illegally migrating to this country should be considered a felony and the punishment should be a few years jail time before being deported if you overstay your visa by a period of 24 hours with exceptions for certain emergencies there should be enforced deportation and if you resist then they should classify that as illegal migration with the same punishments if you think these policies are bad then change my mind
money dont grow from tree an illegal doesnt come to the states with a billion dollar in their pocket and just waiting for someone to tax it
lets build an xray wall aaaa  have you seen my bong man
whar are the actual statistics of people illegally crossing to united states by foot through the mexican frontier
now thats one dumb spaniard
dont a majority of illegal immigrants come in on planes legally and just overstay their visas fence hoppers are a much lower percentage and building and maintaining a multi billion dollar wall along 1 country seems like it would cost more than its worth im not in favor of illegal immigration but a wall is an objectively childish idea
wth is wrong with that spanish dude hes like ignorant in an adorable terrifying way
when you build a wall around where you live then youre now in a prison if you cannot leave without going through a checkpoint controlled by other people correct those people can say yes or no to your leaving thats not a human right but a priviledge given to slave to travel by slave masters a visa is a slave pass historically look it up so is a mastercard think about it see jahtruthnetjah truth dot netvideos on youtube under the same title
his face at the end really summed everything up 
hahahahaha
hes trying 
i do like how you always show the really nice people who just disagree as well with the morons instead of doing what liberal news does saying here is your typical trump supporter and interviewing some hillbillies from the deliverance
soo like an rfid chip as you cross the border through a gate which gate is there a wall between these gates will people accept the chip or is there facial recognition tech involved and rfid snipers at the gate for runners the first lady was actually scared but didnt want to publically agree out of fear what does that tell you
he said that we could tax illegal immigrants
steven crowder  lets go ask uninformed people about a pressing topic also steven crowder   im going to sound more educated for doing this
im mexican against the idea of a wall and even the dude in white made me facepalm
steven im from australia i wont pretend to understand the complexity of the american constitution and legal red tape surrounding political issues of the day however i truly respect your process on issues there are tons of people who will always be for and against but the majority of those sides arent informed arent educated and dont have the opportunities to all the information relevant your views are your own but your willingness to be corrected or mind changed on issues using relevant data is a fantastic way to get people talking thats what reform is about talking not yelling debating not arguing kudosfrom australia 
lol crowders face at the end  yeah  maybe some star wars sheet mang with scanners and light sabers
lets just chip everyone on earth and get it over with its both a feasible and realistic goal to have and totally not a violation of peoples privacyoh and checkpoints without a wall where you get in with an xray scanner and a note offering free radiation will totally get them to obey the law
there are much more pressing matters that need federal money than a physical wall between the two countries for one there needs to be education to all as to why illegal immigration happens in the first place to everyone involved
even though the border and immigration reform is logical we are forgetting the human side of this we are forgetting that these are people with families steven crowder is an ass that doesnt actually wants his mind to be changed the show is fake crowder is fake stroke my ego crowder
2nd guy is retarded legal or illegal everyone pays taxes
steven crowder is a trump talking head that is not even a real americanwhat a shill where is yusef
she seems to think that there is no door to go back and forth
holy hell i was kinda hoping someone would put up at least a decent argument
damn man this is a serious question for us americans while i dont believe in building a wall illegal immigration causes more problems than it solvesno borders would be nice but this isnt a utopian society we have far too many violent and mentally ill people on this planet to just let humans travel freely it would be nice if everyone was peaceful and accepting of one another but that will never happen evil will always surface somewhere and gather like minded or influenceable followers
people who say they think we should have no boarders are actual idiots
immigration is complex the problems that lead to individuals immigrating to any country are complex problems deeply rooted in government corruption and violence a wall to my opinion is too simple and stupid of a solution to actually do anything it is an insult to a country that is supposedly an ally to be treated like a pest or like unwanted animals dialogue and addressing the problems in both sides of the border will secure both countries and make illegal immigration less likely to take place sitting down and recognizing the fact that both sides have a responsibility in this issue  and creating strategies together will do so much more than building a fence or a wall or a crocodile pit at the border i usually agree with many of the arguments presented by this dude but this one youre so wrong a wall separates and no matter who or what it is separation will always bring weakness and uncertainty
so pretty much mr white t shirt sums up liberals as a whole
oer the land of the free and the home of the bravei dont know what happened to america i dont know why people are selfish and think the way they do some illegal immigrants have been physically and mentally abused some even starve to death it isnt just in nk but also in mexico why cant we open the doors for the incidents who want a new life not everyone is a criminal we have opportunity that other dont in their foreign country wouldnt it be right to save them from their poverty and give them a chance building a wall would cause thousands of hispanics despair not everybody from mexico is a legitimate criminal i know people who walked across deserts to live here freely were all technically immigrants this land originally belonged to the natives which made whiteseuropeans some of the first criminals in this nation im not attacking any ethnicity its selfish not wanting to help anybody live a better life now change my mind
germany built a wall   id like to hear mr crowders opinion on how well that worked out for germany what the current status of the wall in germany is today and how he thinks building a wall between other nations is going to improve relations between america and the country in question and whether it will be an overall improvement to the current situationnow as ive stated many times its impossible to change a persons mind i know steven crowder will never change his opinion on this or any other subject regardless of the argument presented so im really speaking to the people who are undecided on this issue
if the media would tell the whole truth about the border  comman folk on both sides would unite as one  it seems so strange to me that the majority of people do not deny the reality that politicians and msm on both sides are all under the same thumb in the same pocketand yet  most people wont even stop to consider the possability that the narritive on both sides is engineered for psycological intents and purposes the border needs to be secured yes but the problem with human trafficking and drug trafficking is far more comprehensive and co operative with us agencies  ngos etc  then any politician or msm outlet will ever let on    if they told us the truthwed be haveing a very different conversation but those who are in power  their power is contingent upon controll controll is contingent upon mass manipulation   stop being manipulated
can we put the wall in the ocean  jk even though hes talking like a fool i give props to that dude for sitting down and spending some time talking about the situation rather than sliding by like a lazy bum pretending to care about issues and caring only for his own popularity and wellbeing
the guy with the backpack is a fucking retard
my god no words for this dude i just cannot understand him spanish dude
lol blurrs her face keeps her face on her neck card
pretty interesting episode
we are not a country if you do not have boarders
i believe there shouldnt be a wall because trump said hed make the mexicans pay for it but that could start a war even though we would win we would be more susceptible to attacks from other countries north korea
man those statistics are totally bunk multiple studies have shown that undocumented immigrants do not commit crimes at levels relative to the us native more population whether it be homocides or drug trafficking etc that really makes this change my mind disingenuous
borders will be a thing of the past i hope i die before i see the day
the wall is a colossal waste of money time and effort the majority of illegal mexicans in the us come here on work visas or other legal ways and overstay the wall wouldnt do shit
its to expensive
man that spanish guy is a fucking moron
mental note do not set up your table in front a bar next time
trump lies constantly change my mind
that was funny governor good luck how about governing your opinion first before going public with it
i hope this guy dont ever run for anything in new mexico i live here in new mexico and man this guy xray tag wtf build the wall and put him over it plz lord help new mexico
ohmygod  that was fantastic  i wtfd so many times listening to that guy blab on  steven change the video title to build the wall  change my mind rough draft and do this again somewhere else
build the wall so we can keep the americans out of mexico
yo fuck face do a video on the tariff  btw i like your video but i hate trump and o canada 
the first male to speak is basically implying for governments to be inside of your bedrooms hand them your rights at that point wouldnt be surprised if he said rights oh thats a thing of the past
electronic xray id gates without a wall
a 3000 mile long xray machine that magically inserts tracking chips as you pass through   wow how come i didnt think of that  so hes going to meet up with his scientists and get back to us  this is amazing  we are all saved 
it blows my mind that not a single person that sits down at these asks exactly what stevens thoughts are on the subject how can you change someones mind if you dont know what is on their mind
jesus that spanish guy from new mexico made my head hurtyes to boarder wall with help of modern technologyhave a drone hub 12 drones where they charge and can be activated remotely by pilots a few miles apart from each other to span the boarder have it managed by personal boarder agents and computer to detect motion on the boarder if motion or visual ir normal camera conformation is accomplished have a patrol go out and round them up with the drone tracking their movement when illegals are processed the drone footage along with body cams and reports are the evidence provided we can keep agents safer and have it done cheaper with the technology at present agents can monitor from a far and report to patrols in the area what to expect weapons drugs children etc and respond accordingly and have more information to go off of maintenance will be cheaper and can adapted to new technological advances in the future you could even lay down an invisible wall of motion sensors which trigger an alert that the agents can respond to with the drone before dispatching a patrol
what the hell was that some ideas are better kept to yourself
wow that second dude taping was an idiot
yesbuild the wallwhen most of your illegal immigrants came by plane and overstayed their visacoz walls keep planes out
lol that second guy is a pure democratjust tax them
spanish kid did a good job describing legal immigration and then went full dystopian 
go for it bud new mexico governor all the way clearly youve got this
i go to the university of texas at austin and as a young conservative i feel the hate represented in this video often for the party that preaches tolerance and acceptance liberals sure do have a bad way of showing it to those who disagree with them keep up the great work steven wish i could have been there
i am a cheap prick and i support yall paying this great man thank you  d
boy  bear
not sure whats hard to understand about the white shirt guy yea he rambles but his points are still pretty cleartranslation americans are buying the drugs and creating a market so the blame for the drug trade does not fall soley on the supplierssociety will eventually reach a point where borders are no longer acknowledged as being a deeply important necessity to divide governmental systemseveryone should have tracking devices in them that can be scanned remotely to keep track of peoples positions and habits
i got brain damage listening to that guy from new mexico literally they are turning into a new mexico ugh
why does that white shirt guy sound italian
do one about drugs
most immigrants dont even come into the country on foot complete waste of money
blurs entire faceleaves id card alone
last guy is hilarious
how can someone like that xray guy survive in this world
lmao  all the fucking retards that thing the wall would work
derrrr im a liberal derrrrr i need the news to make up my own mind and opinion derrrrr
what is the second guy talking about
hes been thinking for 3 years with his master mind pals and he came up with a fuckin x ray wall whats more expensive a stone wall or delicate science equipment lmao
the stats prove we need better security its just fucking fact  and tax them  37 of homcides  from illegals and you want to tax them  buddy fucking leave is called protection not fucking money crisis
i think this guy is enforcing mark of the beast at the same time  i really think he thinks  that he thinks right lol
flat earth
who would watch leroys podcast
steven crowder prays on people who are uneducated in politics try going up against someone who understands the issues
he is gunna be governor of new mexico lol god help them
flat earth
i mean i wouldnt pay taxes too theyre onto something
this guy is missing a few brain cells
that first woman was awesometurn those illegals in
the guy with the white shirt and little camera must love brawndocuz it has electrolytes
portpass makes more sense than passport  change my mind
dude in the white shirt if fucking out there man focus on a thought fucking tweeker
all hard drugs come thru the mexican border more or less
the next governor with all the scientifical expertise  to take on immigration and the xray wall its good to know the future is in competent hands
leroy was painful to listen to and im sad hes the voice of nm im not supportive of the host but leroy sounds as stupid as he looksghetto trypical
u suck dude
the second guy is becoming more and more prevalent  people in this country spend too much time on social media watching television and movies  all of his ideas are fantasy land  so many stupid people in this country so many
if the mexicans hate their country so much why not band together against their corrupt government instead of cowering over to the us
did the guy in the white shirt say scientifical 
if there was a wall then no families would have been separated  build that wall keep families together
is the new mexico guy possibly the most dumb and clueless person in his state
an xray border bwahahahahaha
so a wall is bad mark of the beast chips in everyone is ok    right
holy crap that kid is clueless af
born here i dont pay taxes but then i know shit  like truth
i just lost brain cells listening to this guy from new mexico
no when the wall ya up it will not get worse thats the point
make them pass the test somehow   so let them get a free pass  so they can pass taxes so what america is just a whore fir illegals to have their way with  fucking beaner fuck offf your family been here fir hundreds of years and you speak english like every other first generation  idiot
news flash literally all meth comes from mexico
35 of the population commit 37 of the homicides what what is the source
illegal immigration undermines national sovereignty change my mind
1035 im getting a big brotherlover vibe from this guy
this guy seems awfully nice and good hearted but holy crap he has some terrible ideas lol
any time someone talks about electronically tagging people the hairs on the back of my neck stand up in a bad way
shouldve been done on college campus like the rest where generally students are educated on the matter and can give good arguments
well the new world orders propaganda is working dude is begging to be enslaved these people are foreign invaders their puppet masters are traitors
any source on 36 stat
i think what you also dont understand is that legal immigrants are still treated like shit in this country and people paranoid over the scary illegals tend to assume that everybody foreign might be an illegal and act hostile toward them anyway
well i have a controversial opinion for youimmigration here illegally is no more harmful than jaywalking its a victimless crime breaking a trivial rule we take too seriously and when we find an illegal our only course of action should at most be a fine like a traffic ticket until they get their documentation in order and we should be providing them an easy direct avenue to do soinstead we have a system so convoluted that even people born and raised here for decades have difficulty figuring it out or passing the citizenship exams when tested resources are inadequate red tape too thick and its all too easy to lose legal status on top of it in fact the most common illegal is someone who came here on a work visa and was strandedillegal immigrants still pay taxes like the rest of us if they pay for any services or get any kind of job but they dont get the same refunds back or benefits so they actually pay even more than we do and are already being punished enough for their    crime   the image of people sneaking in to do mischief is a cartoonish stereotype that seldom applies to reality and if they want to live here they should only be helped along not treated like animals
im spanish lol 
change my mindpro trump
i like how he only is able to debate against people that are not subject matter experts or very educated in general
get to the point leeroy
holy shit im mexican and i dont know if that guy was trying to help the situation with the wall but i say build that wall so bad immigrants dont come in theres bad people in every culture whites blacks whatever the problem will always be there im just curious when that wall is finally built what everyone is going to do when the problems of drugs and rape and murder are still a problem who is everyone going to blame next right now its mexican people whos next
im not african american im just american change my mind
with regards to american corporations ceos and rich people in general not paying taxes or disproportionate taxes through loopholes should we deport them too 1 corporations taxes is the equivalent of 100s of 1000s low income contributors combined
that spanish dude doesnt seem to realize that his xray project would most likely cost a lot more money than a freaking wall why are people so offended by the wall when at the same time they do believe in some type of border control  it doesnt make any sense  how about we see how effective the wall is first
yeah tax people without jobs
thats not how xrays work
planes exists and half of immigrants come here from mexico by plane not commercial flight dumbasses so dont even so yeah that part
this is the reason to change your mind  httpsyoutubeqb5gl9lukvm
35 of the populationillegal immigrants account for 37 of the murders in the country did i hear that right
most people that are against the wall dont even know what illegal means start from the foundation and try to explain them what illegal means its very clear they dont understand the difference between coming to america legally and illegally
all i want to know is how many peyote buttons and or psilocybin mushrooms the first spanish guy had eaten before he sat at your table he sounds like he graduated from chuck the schmuck schumers school of  moonbat theology
im super embarrassed to be a latino now lol
wow i think my iq has gone down after listening to the second guy
could you try and find dumber people perhaps the down syndrome and motorcycle accident victims holy shnike these people are literally the best argument that all immigration from the southern border should stop my favorite is the im spanish not mexican guy who is an obvuos mestizo but claiming his spanish ancestors were in the south west in the 15th century dumb and not exactly a historian either
this dudeis one of the legal immigrants that deal drugs jesus fucking hellhe needs to calm downuh and think about what he is sayinguh
im kind of against the wall just because it heavily affects the habitats of many many animals why cant we just kill them
i feel dumber after listening to leroy nothing he said made one bit of sense may god have mercy on your soul good job crowder
build the xray wall
no borders in 510 years bull fucking shit
borders are going to become a thing of the pastuh  people are gonna be able to travel super fastuh
put some actually well versed liberals or just non partisan moderates in front of this guy and if he is open his mind will be changed
so if illegal immigrants commit 37 of homicides and blacks commit 50 are you telling me that legal immigrants asians whites muslims etc are all combined for 13 of homicides that doesnt add up
pretty sure that the tech that can scan things isnt fucking xray technology
the guy with the white shirt thinks that anyone who crosses the border should be granted citizenship a social security number so basically this dude is saying that the us shouldnt have borders or regulations at all and anyone from anywhere can simply dump their families into this mushy pool that the left has created are you fucking kidding me a country without borders isnt a country at all why should illegals be able to skip the line and not have to wait their turn while wholesome law abiding alien individuals wait years to become citizens if undocumented immigrants already break the law by simply walking in do you think that theyre going to obey the law when theyre already in heregovernor of new mexico someone dump him in the middle of the pacific ocean thx
at 957 give em an electronic tag what are you thinking leroy these criminals are like ducks or dolphins where scientists tag bag and release into the wild to monitor maybe you would make better sense if you didnt talk as if you just stepped out of the movie idiocracy
aww i was looking forward to this when i put it in my watch later there was nothing here    but that face at the end was priceless omg
hahaha stevens expression is the exact expression i would have had accept with the addition of me mouthing wtf
this problem has already passed now if youll excuse me i have to return to my memes
why dont we just take mexico and then we wont have to worry about that shit no more
that boy said he plans to be the governor of new mexico but he cant even form rational thoughts and doesnt understand that people willing to enter the country illegaly will still find a way to do so even more easily with open borders his xray border sounds ridiculous
does steven have security with him some of these places he travels to can be very hostile to nonliberals
i just took  a shit with a higher iq than leroy
804 what about the sex offenders criminals psychopaths human traffickers child abusers and sadists amonst the undocumented
37 of homicides committed by illegal immigrants  cant be  most homicides are concentrated in the african american community  thatd mean that virtually all others are committed by illegals  cant be  research this and offer a correction
i like how her face is blurred but not her name tag with her photo
the guy in the white shirt  i couldnt listen to this guy all i heard was waaaa waaaa waaaaa he cant fuckjng talk make a point
steven i think you should try this topic again in a different location texas might seem like the best place but you might get more of a response if you went somewhere like nyc where the latino population may be bigger lots of activists there so tread softly for yourself not them but i know people there wont be afraid to talk to you its a strong topic to discuss especially given the woman who sat down to speak about whats going on in her own neighborhood and is too afraid to report it i really feel for her i used to work with families who lived in the projects and were too afraid to report the suspicious activities going on there out of fear of being deported themselves they just wantto be safe while they sort their own lives out
im crying  if you type in go green global on instagram it comes up with leeroys page and he sells weed
whats with the water bottle plant thing
dont build a wall im not american but thats gonna cost you a fortune and its gonna be paid for using tax money its not worth it
i think i saw a clone of you in makarska croatia a few days ago
build the wall
more change my mind please
dude she is not pixelated enoughif i knew this woman i could recognize her on the streetshes in a box now
this guy speaks like he never went to school  like hes a valley guy or something  do people really believe the liberal lies this is truly surprising what he describes is exactly what will be happening in the near future  when it does this guy will wonder how he got to where he will be when it is happening to him  surprising that they think all this technology will solve the issues of being responsible to the creator for your own actions no one else except you is responsible for you  if you cant do the time then do not do the crime  the crime against the creator will be handled by him in the next life and it will be directly a result of our own actions here  our responsibility is ours  we own our own mistakes no one else  there are a multitude 65 to be exact ref daily mail of countries that have walls on their borders  because they work  there will be more  the reason is simple the world leader who ever and whatever that means will need control there is only one way to control check points through walls  the problem is that the creator said that we should live as free men taking responsibility for our own actions  my heart breaks for the people who are threatened with violence by the illegals  fight back for your the legal immigrant rights  dont let them win by default
that kid makes me want to build the wall and im mexican lol
building the wall to the specifications trump wants will take years more than he will be in office for it will take a lot of tax payer money to build and a lot of workers who will  more than likely be mexican making the infrastructure better and having more border patrols would bring the number of illegal immigrants getting into the us lower as well as regularly scanning for tunnels being dug to transport drugs or people in
support building a wall and end illegal immigration or support human trafficking obama made his choice he placed kids with human traffickers httpswwwsnopescomfactcheckdidobamaadministrationchildrenhumantraffickers
just two quotes from this guy i dont know i plan on being the governor of new mexico one day d and just get some mastermind planers and they would figure it out d his plan for illeagal immigration is to make the immigrants legal and when you ask him how do we do that just some masterminds will figure it out dddd
but americans are the primary consumers of these drugs these undocumented immigrants are bringing in
guy in the white shirt is completely retarded change my mind
 lmao
ah the left they might agree that there is a problem but they will never offer a plausible solution 3
my daughter married a dreamer his whole family  mom dad brother sisters are illegal aliens and are on welfare they pay no taxes dont believe me watch httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlq4wbokfnte
gringo is living in the future hollup he on crack
this guy is a nut hes talking about some dystopian nazi american with xray borders and electronic chips to id people he wants to be a governor    
wage gap is a myth change my mind
i think everyone should take the front doors of there homes 
the white shirted guy makes me cringe
sure a wall would be great but whos gonna pay for the wall mexico 
if this guy has 3 years of developed thoughts then omg 
its not interesting when uneducated people think they know what theyre talking about
steven  can i ask you something what is the point of doing what you do for real i feel like all you ever do is breed negative energy and turn people against each other you love the attention and you adore ridiculing all the people that have opposing viewpoints nothing good ever comes out of these stupid conversations maybe instead of turning people against each other and spreading hate how about you invest your time in something that gives you purpose talk about mental illness within the homeless community talk about sex trafficking talk about child hunger talk about issues that matter and spread love instead of hate you have a platform where you can share your voice about things that matter consider doing so find your purpose
electronic id tag this dude just said we should chip illegals like dogs lol
maybe get one educated well spoken person to debate you on things instead of very obviously oblivious people lmao its not fair that you come at this with research and all this shit and only argue with people talking out their ass you rely on people making emotive arguments
does this count as a podcast
that second guy looks high
i wonder how healthy my testicles would be if i walked over the xray border everyday lol
maybe mexico will pay and build the xray border
xray border
the poor guy in the white shirt is high af
im moved to el paso texas so many people here claim to be spanish so they dont have to say there mexican cause you get harrased for being mexican i seen it too many times
laser ray borders
can we get a 2 and possibly 3 to this
build the wall with your ass bitch 
fucking dumb mexicans no solutions just money  great wall  bad
have had ha ha im not scientifical  but i want to be the governor and develop an xray border where people go through scanners that tracks their  movements
the dude wants the 300mil lawabiding tax paying americans to be frequently xray scanned rather than securing the border k den
change my mind drive by yelling
im sure i lost brain cells listening to that second dude
to me it is a little unfair how people can come into america illegally and all when my mom came here legally and work hard to get be a citizen it took her rent years in and out of court to become a citizen
what a wall gunna do when they can just go over or under it they been flying over and digging under since the beginning
im honduran and i support this build the wall
how do you sit down to have an intelligent conversation and fuck it up thanks fake mexican
wow fuckn morons 
where can i find the statistics on homicides violent crimes and drug trafficing
im sure that the government brings in the majority of the drugs but they wouldnt include that in the stats
most people lock their doors and a lot of property owners have fences with gates around their property  i simply dont understand whats so wrong with doing the same thing around our country and making sure we know who is coming in  no one is saying stop all immigration i realize thats what is being said by the vast majority of media but it simply is not the case
the border wall is a bad idea because walls are hard to maintain and a lot of the border doesnt have good foundations for a wall  i propose a system of sensitive seismographs that can pick up digging underground with drones with infrared cameras in the skies  those alert border patrol agents to the presence and size of groups crossing the border  tunnels we drill into and drop some high explosives into to collapse them  hope there are no people in them at the time but they should know the risksbasically a wall is old technology and we can do better these days
well the last guy wants a doorway for electronic id cards but with no wall i am not sure why they just wouldnt walk around the doorway lol i just dont get these people that want our country flooded with people if we keep just letting in everyone that wants to come in we will become a third world country because there wont be enough jobs and money to go around we would have to support a ton of people that dont have jobs wonder if the liberals keep the doors unlocked in their house with a everyone is welcome to come in sign
fuck illegal immigrants send them back to their shithole they are so proud of
27k bewbs disliked this build the wall deport the roaches
lol an xray border
ill change your mind the wall is too expensive to build 70 billion and to maintain 150 million a year youre better off increasing security at the border deportation is also expensive 400600 billion your immigration plan will cost a lot of money
spanish guyjust tax themand it will make the country more moneyok so you need to work to be taxed if you made all the illegal immigrants legal immigrants then its going to be harder for the average person to get a job which means theyre there gonna live off the dole or benefits whatever you call living of the workers tax money in america and its going to cost your economy more and more moneyhaving more of something is never a good thing because it just adds to the problem and it loses its worth this is simple politics this kid hasnt a fn clue
dealinng witn nazi fools the wall keeps crimianls out of the usa let mexcio keep there criminals now mexico is giving usa there criminals that iave to stop becuase mexican criminals are killing americansthe law have to be enforced ice police got to do there job ice policejob is to tprotect us american citizens from criminals from emxico and any play else for that mater the wall is going to be buildthis nazi foll can scream all she fucking wroings how she hates the fucking wall its going to be build so no mater want the law will be enforced have enough killings enough is enough the people voted trump on 2016 trump is not going to be impeached if you hate president trump you can leave america go to mexico see how mexico as it is do not come back
xray id you mean rfid chips
try again i want to hear you actually discuss this
hey stevencrowder just want to say love the vids but i just got a question where do u get ur info and could u drop links in possible upcoming vids btw i support the right so comment section dont go crazy lol
most illegal immigrants come via airplane
please do one on flat earth pleaseflat earth isnt real change my mind
an xray border are you out of your goddamn mind
its funny how you fuzzed out her face but not her id card
scientifical
that face a the end though
only 13 minutes geez can they be an hour again
leroy the guy proposing an xray border is propot i wonder if he smokes any
i love how they dont want a simple concrete and metal wall but even more invasive xray boarders lmao but still against a wall logic fail
wowthis guy just makes out point for uslol thanks
liberals are against building the wall not because they really hate the idea of building a wall but because its donald trumps idea thats why when bill clinton and hillary clinton said we should keep those illegal aliens out and reinforce our border liberals didnt give a shitif donald trump said we must not build the wall then liberals would be mad that hes not building a wall when trump lowered taxes liberals get pissed and say that hes hurting the middle class and benefiting the rich but if donald trump raised taxes liberals wouldve said that hes trying to take away our money
this guy is a genuisstep 1 implant electrical chips or slap barcode tattoos on every single mexican since you dont know which ones will illegally pass the borderstep 2 create an xray machine that is almost 2000 miles across along with being able to scan the air and surrounding watersstep 3 invent a process to work out if theyre working or simply there to sell drugs maybe the electronic chip can count calories expended like a fitbit high calories expended  probably working so tax them based on calories expendedstep 4 step 5 profit also this will also stop people bringing drugs across the border because reasonsloli just i canthahahaha democrat voters uncovered
if we do not stop the influx of illegals this country will flounder
im not mexican im  spanishpos
this was hard to watch
the second guy is so stupid is like a 5yearold boy speaking about his imaginary ideas
that1st woman is retarded bravo liberals
build a fuckin catapult and trebuchet and sling shot these mexicans back home
xray border who the fuck is this idiot
do a 2nd edition in a serious leftwing area
the vast majority of illegal immigrants arrive via airplane the vast majority arent from mexico a wall would create more of a financial burden than it could  prevent
1determine what your stance is on a subject 2 passionately defend it  3 start to think of some reason why you have taken your stance if the facts of your argument dont coincide with your passionate belief then just ramble about nonsense welcome to todays america i want the border wide openbut my mind is slammed shut
illegal is illegal is that so hard to learn
woooooow  that young man has the tenacity but is just barely scratching the surface  hopefully he will dig deep enough to realise his previous statements were wildly off and understands how this all pans out realistically
this is why we need more border security so we can stop wasting money on illegals year after year and start educating these daft people
hey steven you always engage with people that either berate you or do not challenge you at all its boring has anyone actually managed to change your mind because if they havent whats the point to this exercise id love to debate you
wtf an xray wall whos going to fund that a highly expensive highly radioactive fake wall that cant do jack shit to pick up someones id do these people even think
god is not real change my mind
these discussions expose the monumental ignorance of people in this country they all have strong opinions but absolutely no understanding of the issues
a drone wall would be cheaper and more efficient a structural wall equals bloated socialism for border control most illegal immigration happens at 30000ft with a plane ticket trumps wall is not 30000ft tall 25 billion dollars to curb a net zero influx is a waste of resourcesthere are more reasons but your willfully ignorant so whats it matter
how high was this first guy lmfao
you guys really think it would just be a bland wall with no technology or though behind it lol
422 we might find some areas where we disagree verses areas where we disagree lol 
liberal here you can have the wall if you give us daca dealif you think the wall will secure the border fine build it its a onetime cost plus a little maintenance no big deal but you cant just say to those who have been here for 3040 years oops lol we really shouldnt have let you come in or stay that long but now youve got a job and family and future here you have to go my badthe issue of dreamers and illegal parents of citizens will not go away without some kind of action and the solution cannot be to split up children from parents or to punish people 30 years after they or their parents broke the law america caused this problem now it must own itmake a path to citizenship it doesnt have to be easy  make it take 10 years and requiring proof of loyalty dedication to learning english and learning the structure of american government etc but there needs to be a secure future in sight you cant have entire generations being raised in a permanent limbo with the threat of deportation happening at any time  thats not good for those families or the society they live in
while the thousand mile xray border is monitoring them they could use a matter transporter device to beam the ones without a note back to mexico
1018 youre gonna need a white mans brain to figure out that you need to have a fucking border where  you can check their electronic id
white t shirt guy is dumb as a rock my 5 year old could talk more intelligent than him wtf
i believe like reagan believed tear down that wall i also believe that the world is getting away from borders and towards global citizenship this is a good thing
a true marxist more people to tax yay
the propaganda has fried peoples brain
jesus christ that lady in the beginning is fucking retarded
my only problem with the idea of the wall is it tackles immigration wrong put money into border control upgrade check points hire more agents
build the wall with your ass lmaooo had to laugh
i as 16 year old mexican american know what life is like as an american citizen but in the united states there is not really a support system for legal immigrants that come in the states they practically start off life as a 18 yr old kid who is moving out on their own but typically these immigrants have kids and families to take care of so they take any jobs they can work long hours for low pay and put the money towards their families with that said the money they have for a home isnt going to land them anywhere considered a good or even decent community so when those kids grow up they are going to be a product of the environment therefore two things i would love to see happening in our country is those immigrants who truly do come here for the american dream we help out with their money issues for a period of time which would lead to more and more illegal immigrants to apply to become citizens and i would also like to see lesser income communities become better looking than they do which would lead to the price of homes going up and ultimately leave those immigrants who dont apply to become united states citizens to return to their homeland this can all be done with the money the wall was going to be built with
the guy in the white shirt needs to quit using adderall and educate himself on american history and how things work in the country hes living in a fantasy propaganda narative
as a person that lives in israel really close to a border wall it works wonders
might as well add the name of the song in the intro rightboy  bear  pogobtw
that guy from nm has no clue about incentive structures illegally enter the us  citizenship  okay lets see how that turns out
my deadbeat dad was illegal and he shouldve been deported he does a lot of fucked up shit
at first he was just describing legal immigration just without calling it that then he goes full blown dystopian nightmare and calls for id chips on foreigners as if that would be complete lunacy and require the us to have complete control over the entire hispanic world
i live in michigan literally a bridge away from canada in fact the only thing that separates me from canada is the blue water bridge and lake huronst clair river i can drive to ontario canada from my house in less than 10 minutes if i were unimpeded by border patrol i could swim across easily its so close but guess what in all my 27 years ive never heard of a single issue with illegal immigration from canada and other than the fact that canada is a good place to live compared to places where these other illegals are coming from thats because we have something separating us its not a wall no but its almost as easy to swim over as it would be to climb a wall its the fact that there is something there we have border patrol on the lake and the river we have customs at the bridge these measures keep us separated i go to canada frequently strip clubs are way better there and i know canadians who come here regularly just to go out to eat its very common and because we have proper credentials and documentation we are allowed to visit each others country its literally that simple also if i wanted to become a legal canadian citizen or vice versa there are steps that could be taken to make that happen it just has to be done legally and thoroughly its as simple as that
rand paul makes the most sense  a wall is less effective than taking away the goodies
wow steven you have a lot more patience than i do i wouldnt be able to sit and try to rationally talk with these idiots
lmao we need an xray wall
because a wall will be ineffective expensive and impractical
its better to put an armed force along the boarder and shoot whoever crosses illegaly instantly
its not about being anti latino or anything racial its just about security and mass numbers of usually improvised folk bringing large problems with them as a latino that barrier has to be built as stated in prageru
the only reason im against building trumps 20 ft wall is that it is not practical at all sure it will create jobs but the people who would end up actually working those jobs would be temporary laborers that would only be helped minimally and sure more border patrol agents would be hired but that could have been the solution since the beginning plus needless to say a wall still cannot keep everybody out there is a system in place and it would be best if america reenforced that system offered protection for refugees and offered a path to citizenship for those of us who would actually be productive members of american society also its hard not to call it racist when only a southern border wall is being mentionedamerica has it made so much so that many americans cannot begin to imagine the injustices people face outside of their country were too worried about being oppressed that we dont realize we sound privileged afamerican privilege is that a thing  idk 2am thoughts also the last guy sounded like he came from a good place but the whole id tag thing was a little hitlery lol
i think the wall is a very expensive and silly idea it would be much cheaper and more effective if fence jumpers where shot and illegals found were executed publicly then they would just stop
new mexico guy thinks we should insert electronic devise in people  like we do to animals    lol i dont think he will have a future in politics  can you imagine his campaign video  vote for me and i will get you and your family surgical implants  electronic tags so the government knows where you are at all times lol
leroy is a fucking dumbass
what a god damn retadlike dude imagine somekind of i dunno xraying the whole border so people can instantly get citizen shipt then we wont have illeagle immigrants anymore
1st lady  brave woman i hope she stays safe 
i never realized how mind blowingly narrowminded libtards tend to be in all your videos most yell and swear and insult just because they see soneone that has different views
xray the fuck out of them hell yeah
40000  thumbs up2000  thumbs down build the wall
650 ok m8 this mans just said blatant lie 35 of murder coming from illegal there is literally no fuckin source for that info
this guy was clearly brain washed at the university of new mexico unm professors have ateachinggrant theses so called professors are from europe and middle east teaching un policies morals the other professors are teaching antiisrael and antichristian policies and pro islam stance crowder please come to new mexico we need logic and not feelings
they should build the wall from the xfinity war movie when all the creatures were trying to break in into the dome
the second guy reminds me why you wont find a capitalist more specifically corporatists complaining about illegal immigration because it means more money for the employer and less wages and benefits they have to give as more cheap labor comes flooding in considering that looser regulation and cheaper labor in other countries is the main reason for our own corporate exodus problem taxing illys or not on top of the flood of them in the workforce albeit low skilled jobs can give some benefit to the economy as it would fix or help our corporate exodus issue does it outweigh the amount illegals social security cost taxpayers though or the potential compremisation of safety although they can only claim a small portion of social security programs compared to a us citizen also this lowering of wages hurts the employee which is the majority of americans its a tricky situation also the wall is expensive needs a lots of upkeep and is really a static defense that is more of a delay rather than a real problem solver as some people who worship the wall claim it to be it still requires the same or less border patrol in the vicinity but theres a huge slab of taxpayer funded concrete in the vicinity instead point is the wall isnt a holy end all and is a nuclear bombing mentality apporach to solving the illegal immigration problem expensive lots of downsides long lasting effects that arent easily reversed and no guarantee of intended results we do need better border security and better immigration logistics i just dont think the wall is really the best solution i would hope people dont blindly shout and worship build the wall or everything trump or republicans say and propose then they would be just as bad as their much despised leftist
not against a wall on the south border you americans can do what ever pleases you in your country but this is just plain racism you want to secure your borders build a wall on the north border also than we will believe is a matter of national security and not racism by the way shootings in schools movie theaters churches restaurants etc are always carried out by us citizens
build a wall in mexico then a wall in canada then put a roof on it job done safe and secure
some of these people are fools and in educated dicks
1137 that guy doesnt like a wall got it wants people to be chipped and be monitored where they go using that chip so a wall curbs peoples freedoms however chipping people is okand again wont  stop people not registeringand so if your chipped you wont smuggle drugs and weapons no more digging tunnels from mexico to texas this guy has no idea about what he would do however he knows enough to know that trumps got it wrong this is really worrying
steven with this particular issue i do not think a wall would be of any benefit first of all there is the drug issue the drugs brought into the us is very minuscule being smuggled over the border most of the drugs that are being abused are opiates and those are brought in by pharmaceuticals to extend this further the cia brings in a lot more drugs into the united states than any drug smuggler the cia has been the king pins of drugs since their origins in 1950 when they started testing drugs for their project bluebirdartichokemkultraon another note the majority of illegal immigrants are immigrants that have overstayed their visa and these are people that are flying into the us building a wall is not keeping these particular illegal immigrants out of the united states this wall will not stop very much of the migration coming into the country at all because of the fact that most of the immigrants are flying in not crossing the borderfurthermore this project is going to be taxing the hell out of us citizens since there is a lot of money involved in creating such an infrastructure not only are we going to be taxed for the wall but when you look at the logistics involved with building this wall there will be a lot of eminent domain taking place where people will have their property taken away from them because their property just so happens to lie where they want to build this wall this eminent domain issue was really big when the keystone pipeline was being built as it completely infringed on treaties that were signed with the standing rock sioux tribe and the united states and went over sacred tribal land which was just very very disrespectful furthermore i dont think anyone would be very happy losing a huge chunk of their land for the sake of this infrastructure unless they were not aware of any of the facts behind building the wallthere are absolutely no long term benefits from my position if anything this suites business more than anything i feel that this wall would serve more as a giant prison than anything and as a statement from the bureaucracies of haha look we fooled them again and got them to give us more money
655 that mk5 r32 tho 3
yes lets divide earth
im only in favour of the wall because its pissing off leftys personally i dont think it will work what would work is welfare reform that only grants welfare to us citizens and stricter regulations for companies that force them to hire us citizens or legal immigrants
the wall needs to be built because it will serve as a physical deterrent in places on the border that are not manned the border is so long that there is not enough manpower to monitor all of it the left is reacting like we dont want any immigration we do its just that we want the immigration to be legal
please please please address lily singhs therapy for homophobic people  i need your clap backs
its a fucking waste of money theyll just get el chapos crew to build tunnels
im sorry but that first lady with the blurred out face is borderline retarted
america is the most uncultured country in the world
imaginary lines are bullshit
hmmm coming back here in 510 years to see if we can magically travel due to technology and not have any borders lol 846
these ppl r idiots 
the wall wouldnt help cause we got planes
can you do reverse racism is real change my mind
this discussion was especially painful to listen to the moment when kids discover they are able to form their own opinionnot realizing theyre just articulating a personal emotion not based on universal factsis such a special time and probably the end of everyone but thats just my opinion p
anyone against the wall is a fucking idiot and theyre a hypocrite you live in a house that has walls those walls are there to protect you from people that want to commit crimes against you are the walls of your house perfect no but we still have them because they work we compliment them with security cameras guard dogs lighting and locks ive read through a couple of replies from people against the wall and all it looks like is theyre trying to enable criminals gross
the evidence proves that overall illegal immigrants commit less crimes than black and whites though we shouldnt get our point across with lies illegal immigration should stay illegal regardless if they are mostly decent people
this is a blanket comment to all people who want to say most illegals come here by air so building a wall would not do anything well here is the truth about that when they come by air they are coming legally using a visa but once their visa runs out they dont go back however what they could do is while they are here on their valid visa and if they are planning on staying here they should work towards getting their citizenship and we should encourage them to do so if getting the citizenship is too much money and to extreme to be able to do so in a short time a year or 2 then we should start a discussion with congress about making it cheaper and less harsh this will help fix illegals by air then tighten up security at the border either by building a wall or hiring more border control agentsofficers that is how we help fix this issueim not saying it will be 100 effective because nothing is ever 100 effective im just saying that it will help by more than you can imagine
historically illegal immigration was lower than today before beefed up border security the reason being was that illegal immigrants would go home after making money and there was no incentive to bring family over the border not saying having border security isnt important obviously having an easy way to transport drugs into america would be abused by any smart individual but i just thought it was an interesting point if crowder responds ill dig through my joe rogan podcasts to see which one mentioned it
honestly mexico youve violated our sovereignty so many times and youve hated us since we kicked your ass out of texas just say you want war lets just get it over with stop sending secret messages to the german empire and fight me in the ring bro
this one was good
xray wall my boy gonna be the governor of new mexico too much sus
my god that last guy was crazy what level of delusion is that xray borders and what are they born with a specific number inside them that scans when they cross through my god and in 5 to 10 years time were gonna have lightspeed travel what a moron
with that guy saying how we check their ids i just would like to mention that americans have the legal right to not have an id
i feel like ive just gotten dumber watching that future new mexican governor 
im a social democrat that supports building a wall were not all stupid lol
every person who harbors some emotional antitrump opinion 100 of the time is simply misinformed and have been duped by propaganda trump said umm the immigrants are all bringing drugs and and google it for gods sake you lefties claim to be reasonable why are you allergic to doing your own research
christ change my mind is just too good
donald trump literally said theyre bringing drugs referring to mexicans  this man was factually correct
this is the most cancerous change my mind to date
well considering that gary johnson is the current governor of nm that guy couldnt possibly be more of an idiot than they have now
the wall is just a waste of time and money the people we want to really stop is going to get in even if the wall is 50ft tall i am willing to bet the worst people come to the us legally through the border anyways
why does he always lie about stats httpswwwgooglecomampswwwwashingtonpostcomamphtmlnewswonkwp20180619twochartsdemolishthenotionthatimmigrantshereillegallycommitmorecrime
all the new mexico guy talks about is drugs from what he is saying he probably is on them
a physical wall should be built any obstacle is better than none can you walk up to a wall and just jump over it fly over it shovel under it walk around it realistically yes it will defer most make it harder for people and they will not attempt it also people miss out the main factor of this wall its merely a statement symbolic and a means to an end
i dont want illegal immigrants here its a slap in the face to me and my family and other people i know its a slap in the face to legal immigrants who followed the rules did the paperwork gave the money and took the test required and waited patiently to get their visas or whatever to be allowed to live here and create a better life here also building a wall wont do much of anything its a waste of money think of something else if you can
and x ray border these people dont come here and go they come here leech off the tax payers and bitch about people racist cause dont want them here for a reason if your smart enough your understand this
no borders just a xray wall dividing people from different countries   dudes been watching to much star trek smh
yeah im pretty sure that the statistics actually show that illegal immigrants commit less crime than us natives mostly because they do not want to risk getting deported also i completely support that the us should have appropriate checks and screens in its borders however when these immigration policies offer less opportunities to hopeful immigrants just because of the country from which they come from we enter the dangerous path to racist policies not only is building a physical wall an obscene way to spend taxpayers dollars but it is a hostile act of discrimination xenophobia and complete lack of respect to our neighbor in the south remember the us was built by immigrants looking for a better life so why should we deny the opportunity to thousands of hard working individuals to follow that same path to a better life ps having more open borders is actually beneficial to a countrys economy according to most top economists around the world so all of these aliens that steal our jobs are actually creating more  build bridges not walls
yeah accept everyone and give them technological monitoring identification tags called mark of the beast with digital currency built into it so there will be no more poverty but you need to accept the agreement of totalitarian control over you firstcreate the problem offer the solution nice job antichrist
why do all open borders people sound clinically ill they can barely form coherent thoughts or sentences
give them all legal citizenships lol
the future mexican with the cam is the reason why you should build a wall
this spanish guy has no idea
he said scientifical 
you talked to that moron way too long 
wish i wouldve been there  im torn on the wall because i have really good arguments for both prowall reasons dont want  ms13 al queda or others getting in  and overflowing of people who rather drain from society  and any other real criminals coming in nowall reasons dont want to be trapped here when shtf i believe in fundamental freedom which includes freedom to travel unhibited its not financially viable with all our other debtsobligations  non us citizens arent illegal go read the irs code and this is quite obvious the no wall solution  which is far superior to the wall solution is to end the war on drugs end for profit prisons  and most importantly end the welfare state  the government incentivizes illegal immigration with ebt ssc section 8 etc and if that stops  youll stop most coming here  they know the government is going to take care of them  
yo this guy is freaking scary putting chips into everyone youre freaking insane wheres the freedom in that ah hello its america home of the free
trump is better than obama change my mind
several studies done in the last year or so have shown that immigrants both illegal and legal are considerably less likely to commit a crime than a native born us citizen
ok so the dude approves tagging them with rfids and subjecting them to xrays  rofl wtf dude
a lot of people dont want to pay taxes actually no a lot would be willing if resources would be avaible some dont due to the fear of being persecuted for not having legal documents which is actually false lastly the guy you interviewed was on some high shit
hey steven in this video says 30 of homicides are by aliens i for the life of me cant find information to back it it sounds right but is there a linj out there to help me out
yoo the guy talkin bout xray walls had me dying 
in general americans have become very stupid its disgraceful
as soon as the male got into the chair i knew he was going to be a dumb ass
you should blur her face morewhy put her in harms way for this
when sin and death are destroyed is when open borders will be a thing
one of my friends said one of the dumbest things about the wall ive ever heard he is pro illegal immigration but devil advocate argued that the wall wouldnt work because it would trap the already millions of illegal immigrants in america
answer its a waste of tax dollarsi mean isnt it painfully obvious its a moronic idea to begin with the real task convince me why the wall should be built how did that idea even see the light of day anyways have we sunk that low as americans that we will actually entertain that bullshit wall
actually a recent study came out and  it shows that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native born americans so yes it is disproportionate just the other way around  for the record there were other studies that found similar results all of which could be found doing a quick google search  source httpswwwgooglecomampswwwwashingtonpostcomamphtmlnewswonkwp20180619twochartsdemolishthenotionthatimmigrantshereillegallycommitmorecrime
most undocumented immigrants come by plane  for example they have a visa and overstay it  a wall in my opinion is a waste of tax payer money and wont really change this problem as they will continue to just fly in  i am not sure why people buy into the idea that they dig tunnels or jump fences to get over when border security will catch most of them  however no one checks to see if you go back by plane so once you land you can just crash at someones house and no one will ever know
hes on as a light switch
a discussion becomes boring when one of the sides clearly has no idea what theyre talking about show us some smart opponents
usually really enjoy these videos but this one made me sad
1003thats how you sound like when youre on speed the guy talked a lot about drugs too even though no one mentioned it which is a very distnctive character of drug users
you only upload the most clueless people which makes you look smarter than you actually are any well educated and well informed individual can make you look stupid on this issue
just punish americans giving work to illegals punish americans for paying under the table to avoiding taxes they come here because they can find work if they cant find work they have no reason for coming here its not their fault for trying to better themselves we should be punishing the americans who caused this problem
at 1316 he looks like jim after michael does something stupid on the office
i feel like building a wall is being antimexican or antilatino i know some illegal immigrants that are canadian so if immigration is the problem we should also be building a wall along the canadian border even though most of them may be from latin america if we want to solve the issue of immigration then we need to secure all borders not just the spanish speaking border nobody should enter a country illegally because its against the law but we cant target one group of people from one country an illegal immigrant from german mexico canada or italy is still an illegal immigrant they should all have the same difficulty or ease when entering the country
if only the us was surrounded by water people hate walls people love islands
you should do a change my mind segment that reads  feminist are sexist change my mind because as a woman im sick and tired of american women complaining like this is a third world country and not realizing how good we actually have it
so screw the wall lets just screw in microchips on our heads
why build a wall when you can dig a moat it will cost a fraction of the wall idea and will have a better effect instead of being able to walk away after trying to get in they are stuck in a 50 foot deep hole problem sorted job done thanks again brittish bloke for your logic
these people have no thoughts of their own its insanity
easy1expensive2inefficient3bad for fauna
every passing minute i listened to leroy i felt myself becoming stoopider
the wall is our hoover dam its just jobs just in case the economy crashes
location location location im guessing for the lack of participation
blur out her id badge as well
a wall will only boost the ladder industry in mexico
holy crap at 329    im genuinely shocked    i didnt see that coming
thats gonna be one expensive wall
im against the wall for the same reason im against pouring coka cola on your genitals to stop pregnancy i dont understand how it stops anything it seems largely metaphorical who plans on uprooting their whole life and plan it for months and save money just to get there and go oh nevermind theres a wall guess ill stop trying the wall would stop a single mother and her child maybe but the cartel the richest lowlives will continue business as normal its a wall not a magical all encompassing dome theyll just tunnel or the popular crossing will change stop illegal immigration by all means but a wall wont stop the problem people
we  yousef  
oh yea build a wallrofl electrify it make it razor sharp dont you freakin people get it they can dig a tunnel faster than professional construction workers with million  equipment in less than half the time
build a wall like the great wall of china i dont see any mexicans in china
can someone provide me a reference as to where the statistic of 37 of the homicides are done by illegal immigrants
yes xray gate no borders that makes perfect sense you go run for governor 
cant we all just live in peace
do god doesnt exist
405 to watch a complete space cadet
lets let everyone in this country 1 billion chinese come on over
lol by reading some comments i just wish people commenting had just a little bit of stevens common sense both pro and con both parties are showing some really retarded points
i would have loved debating with you on this subject
lol steven man hahahaha sometimes you are on point but sometimes you are not the whole concept of building that wall its borderline pun intended moronic its a waste of money and frankly you folks better use it for another things now regarding immigration policies yes reform them make changes but the idea of a physical wall its bananas
there are a few reasons to not build a border wall1 it hasnt been proven that it will reduce illegal immigration the majority of illegal immigrants did not cross the border illegally the majority is also not from south america the majority come here on visas and overstay them and the majority or from china2 who owns the land that the border wall will be built on government it is public land which means the taxpayers technically own it with the way property rights work multiple people cant own the same property otherwise one will be violating the property rights of the others if 51 of the people decide to sell it to china the other 49 have no property right because their consent is being circumvented we either have property rights or we dont all property should be private3 people want to put up the wall to stop illegal immigrants from coming here not because they are afraid of them because they consider them a drain on our economy due to receiving free aid from the governmentfood stamps etc but the problem isnt the immigrants its that there are free handouts to begin with the government takes peoples money and gives it to other people that is also called socialism4 who will pay for the wall i know trump said he will make mexico pay for it but that is just delusional taxpayers always pay for everything our government does so again a bunch of us are going to be forced to pay for something we are against no human being has a right to force someone else to buy something they dont want but thats exactly what government and voting achieves not to mention the tariffs he is imposing on foreign countries those countries wont end up paying for that the cost is always passed on to the consumer its just sad that most people have no clue how economics workim not democrat or republican actually im voluntaryistex libertarian so when i criticize trump realize that i also criticized obama bush clinton bush sr reagan give credit and blame where they are due instead of basing my opinions on emotion i dont want government i dont want anyone forcing me to do or pay for anything i dont want i dont care if you want that more power to ya just dont involve me let me live in peace as a free human being
immigration reform is necessary but the wall is not the answer
so bro you know what percentage is that anybody today you know commits crimes what a biscuit head
a xray border hummm interesting not really
someone just escaped from a mental hospital  3 years there an x ray border is what he comes up lol
shes totally right a lot of them are garbage and in front of sjws and bleeding hearts they act one way and when they are gone they show their true self they will robe you blind how do i know i am from tijuana and most people are shitty only a very small minority are good people but most of them are not
how the hell are you going to tax people who are undocumented    smhjust make them citizens because its only going to get worse is like saying just get used to the cancer  its only going to get worse  its a nonmitigation argument
smh building an xray wall along the entire border will cost billions and then you have to power it run it film it and have workers everywhere to check the ids and who is going to go to mexico to chip all the people
this new mexican sounds as stupid as an old mexican
35 ur really wanna build a wall for 35 of people
lol woooooooooooooooow
this shit is fucking hilarious im screaming
the wall is a fools version of a good idea its an idiotic bandaid solution to a much bigger problem one that will cost the american people tens of billions of dollars and provide us with absolutely no benefit
just tax them huh this dudes an idiot
her wydme im watching this conservative guy sit down and try and talk with these people from the left and he literally just wants to hear opposing opinions but most of them are ignorant people who dont know what theyre talking about and its hilarious
this person is an idiot an xray machine
just like the running man  shoot why didnt i think of that  man that guy is a genius
waste of money
trump didnt say most mexicans bring drugs maybe not he just said they arent sending their best theyre sending their rapists and criminals
my belief as to why the wall is a dumb decisionfirst off all of us white people are immigrants who came over from europe and killed to colonize this country we all took history classes in school we know thissecondly our ethnicities are not our race there is only one race and its the human race besides the rest of the animal kingdom and together we all live our lives on this earththirdly our country in known to put its nose into other countries problems and honestly as a first world country we should care about the well being of our neighboring countries not try to block them out youd be surprised to see how little a wall would prevent immigrants from entering this country they will find a way its survival instinct as humans we all have itim aware that diseases pest and crooks are something to take into account but does it not sound snobby to slam the door in your neighbors faces who are seeking help protection andor a new life could the homicide percentages be provoked by the lack of protection of our police force could we not send resources such as antibiotics vaccines food water etc to prevent diseases from crossing this imaginary line we call a borderwe could organize a program to help people become healthy legal citizens especially now since trump and his administration have worsened our healthcare making the rich more rich and the poor more poor and wants us to pay for the wall when instead we could use all the money to support the lives of our race we can grow together not as citizens but as human beings
352 you said subdued into fear     talk about putting words into someones mouth which you accuse people of doing all the time she said they were money laundering theyre prolly the homies
lol another fool brainwashed by the media clearly doesnt do his own research and see how the media twists the presidents words ive seen it
the look on stevens face at the end of that interview priceless
hes handsome and smart marry me i was doing homework as i listened to him talk and i fell in love hahahah not even kidding
masterminded people damn i never thought about that iq level 100000000000
what an idiot 
nah we shouldnt have walls or boarders but some sort of xray boarder wall thinggg
xray border 1025
i wish more attention would be paid to other aspects of illegal immigration than crime focusing on the criminal aspect is a given but its also easy to counter it by playing on emotional aspects it is true the vast majority of people who are here illegally are genuinely good people who just want to provide for their families the inconvenient truth however is that there really only are two options  open borders or border enforcement its uncomfortable sure but there is no in betweenso 1 whether you admit 10 immigrants per year or 10 million there will still be millions who cant come because you cant have restrictions on something without enforcement some of the most progressive countries on earth  norway and denmark for example have some of the strictest immigration policies anywhere how do leftists come to terms with this uncomfortable fact half shove it under the rug and ignore it half join the open border gangwhich brings me to 2 no country has ever tried an open border policy bernie sanders famously called it a koch brothers proposal it would be a massive social experiment and gamble which would be more likely to crumble our infrastructure job market and decimate poor families than anything else leftists generally struggle with numbers there are over a billion impoverished people in the world who would love nothing more than to move to the united states tomorrow how do you double triple even quadruple the population of a modern day country unrestricted without collapse it has never been done i have never in my life seen anyone come up with a comprehensive and realistic plan for this everessentially  the more you force leftists to talk openly about border enforcement they less able they are to claim any moral high road the more you force leftists to talk openly about open borders the more public support they loseim a first generation immigrant im very proimmigration legal immigration
i understand people that supports the wall and all that shit its hard to adapt to see foreign people from different countries and cultures around your area its hard to understand but we need to understand the differences between a legal and illegal immigrant and their situation here in mexico we have a crisis too heres a lot of people from southamerica asking for money on the streets for buy food and stuff and i get they need it but why me why do i have to help you i have problems too i need money too and if you dont give them money they get offended i agree with legal immigration its awesome it helps economy but the illegal immigration needs to be controlled
im more surprised people didnt touch on the topic that this country is supposedly the greatest in the world at least all the patriotic  people i know say that im not saying its right for people to come to america illegally however they come here for safe haven which is something that america has been known for making dreams come true however those mass shootings that happen also reflect a nice demographic of who is in charge of mass killings white mentally incapacitated  americans funny how that works out
his family must own a lot of land lol since 1550
can we build a wall around the backpack guy also the wall is complete nonsense its going to be outrageously expensive and it will interfere with so much from ecosystems to structures already in place not to mention the cost for upkeep oh yeah and a lot of illegal immigrants came here legally and just over stayed visas plus i highly doubt any wall you build will keep out airplanes make a procon list its simple to many cons bad idea
not sure if that guy was a troll or insane
borders are gonna be a thing of the past  borders strengthen a countries culture and civilization remove that and we are back to barbarism no culture no order and more importantly no security
were in too much debt boom no wall there ya go
if usa goberment wants to build a wall they are free to do it but thinking that mexican gob will pay for it is stupid you want your wall you pay for it
not paying for it thats the problem 
love the crowder posse
master mind individuals  
there is no point in these videos no one ever is going to change your mind your opinions are a part of your identity an identity youve been developing ever since and with it you formed certain opinions whether or not they were imposed on you by others you you actually used your head for a bit if someone actually changed your mind your identity would fall apart and you wouldnt be the same person you are anymore thats not in your interest what you are doing here is increasing your publicity with these videos and with it you gain a following of people who agree with you and are basically insulting everyone who disagrees and people who were debating with you in these videos you are trying to show yourself as a smarter and more intelligent individual than people you are arguing against now it is true some people you argue with are not well educated on the topic and act out of pure disagreement and annoyment  with you and then end up being infuriated by you and just leave however you are well prepared for the topic you are going to debate about so you are always at an advantage but then again some people do know about what they are talking about just as you do and it could be a proper debate but its not you are spewing arguments and counter arguments in order to infuriate the opposing party and they are going to do the same its a neverending circle its it not in your personal interest for someone to change your mind its in your interest to show how you are right and no one can prove you wrong period things like this just make me think usa is one huge reality show cheers
i think what hes saying is tag all people and put up invisible fences like you use for dogs on the boarder so you know when they come in then tax them for there time here
this guy is not all there steven made good points
id love to talk to someone like you about this im a legal immigrant from mexico and im very familiar and impacted by all this my first question to you though would be why only build a wall in the mexico us border and not canada 
steven features the dumbest people on his channel in these change my mind videos so he can look smarter
 i am warning you ahead of time that i dictated this to my phone via google  voice and it is probably filled with  wrong words bad grammar misspelled  things that might not make any sense i am too tired to type this out so its up to you to fill in the blanks lol this spanish kid doesnt have a clue what he is suggesting he wants everybody to be biometrically shipped with an rfid identifier that will reveal all personal data all private conversations your location at all times and will even announce you before you even show up to cross through the xray checkpoint that is one of the most dangerous and radical ideas ive ever heard this kid wants complete government control you want no security no privacy just completely open unfettered borders where people can go as they please without any restrictions at all there are so many issues with that i cant even know where to begin this kid wants to live in a totalitarian police state and he thinks that everybody will agree to this absolutely not he doesnt seem to understand the difference between a physical wall and a invisible one whether you are stopped by a barrier physically blocking your path or you are stop by a technological one its still a wall and people will always try and circumvent it people are not going to willingly submit themselves to be shipped like this to be monitored at all times we have a constitution in america and in that constitution we have a bill of rights he is suggesting we burn the constitution with his idea this kid sounds like another brainwashed neomarxist socialist this kid thinks hes going to be governor of new mexico one day this kid sounds like hes lost one too many brain cells from all the dope he smokes i doubt any of his ramblings came from researched ideas it sounds more like his ideas come from conversation she has with his friends while they are all high this kid thinks that we should simply legalize them arbitrarily and then just start taxing them to force them to spend their money in the united states that sounds like a very systemically oppressive law that will single out a group of people over others you cannot treat migrants and naturalized citizens differently if theyre both naturalized citizens a citizen is a citizen the moment you start forcing oppressive laws like that on to people who are now citizens you are actively creating a oppressive system of government that will hold certain ethnicities down this is the exact same thing that sjw and liberals are always screaming this kid is insane if he thinks that anyone would ever vote for a law like that no illegal immigrants would want to become legalized if they were now penalized for it while other people do not he didnt even address the disproportionate amount of violent crime committed by the three percent of illegal immigrants coming to this country now you want to give them citizenship with no borders congratulations kid you just open the floodgates 2 waves upon waves of unskilled uneducated laborers who will simply jump on the system mooching off of government assistance so wheres this tax money going to come from most of these illegal immigrants are on some sort of government assistance already which we are already paying for many people get all of their money under the table and all of their money get sent back to mexico the money that these people make a very large majority of it does not benefit the american economy it gets sent to the mexican economy president trump tried to fund the wall originally under the threat of charging fines for all western union and moneygram wire transfers from america to mexico i just cannot believe the crap that this kid was rambling on about he has no idea what he is even saying you cant form a cohesive sentence or argument this is the typical intelligence of these indoctrinated cultural marxists borders have always been a necessary and essential part of the sovereignty and safety of all countries china had a wall to keep the mongolians out vatican city has a wall that separated from the rest of italy jerusalem has a wall mexicos southern border has a wall help your own yard has a wall surrounding it people need to protect what is theres walls dissuade people who wish to take by force walls keep your property and yourselves safe why was keep america safe you want to have open borders and open immigration fine look what happened to the eu since the syrian war began there is widespread crime and violence all across europe that never existed before people are being bred out of their own countries people are being displaced from their own neighborhoods you cannot have unchecked widespread immigration it is chaos and if you think that you can somehow control it via government monitoring then youre even more clueless than i thought
holy crap wtf was the second person talking about
wow a burnout duda takesa overa the a showa go leroya too short and too many stupid people i may have to get my mastermind group to get back with you though
im against the wall because obviously itll be build with taxpayers money and itll take years to build that also what crimes are the committing violent crimes get yourself a gun are the voting for bigger goverment who isnt deport republicans and democrats for voting for bigger goverment only libertarians can stay immigrants claiming welfare  end the welfare state
when there is a new construction project in a populated area what do they put around it a fencewall not a complete problem solver but a key piece to the puzzle coupled with a security presence it makes it very difficult to invade btw all you treasonous hypocrites on the left go to sleep tonight with your front door unlocked or better yet wide open and see how safe you feel
leroy needs some milk
smh
it takes us years to build things like highways things we actually want to build with realistic logistics the wall will never be built
boy there sure are some dumbass people in this state apparently a lot of them are in austin
am i missing something is trump really this influential to make this a convincing concern for people apparently so since when have mexican people legal or illegal been a major american problem shouldnt we be more concerned at the war were in  and possibly more soon the prison system wealth inequality substance abuse homelessness and the fact that theres a large population of starving children in our country talk about an arrogant entitled racist xenophobic distraction
keeeo im going love this 
good they should deport them and its great that trump seperated the kids from their parents because than they all have to go back  you cant just take in everyone and their mother into a country and give out everything the only thing i do have 1 problem with is that if trump really meant what he said he would have hired only americans at his companies in new york city and new jersey i appreciate that he is trying to build the wall they come here they dont speak english they dont care and they dont even try to apply for citizenship i think if trump made sure the corporations hired more white americans or americans that would better i dont see that as happening which is one of my issues with trump or any president right now for that matter if there are not enough jobs for americans that already live here how can they bring in more peoplethe guy in the middle of the video said hes spanish but hes not mexican he doesnt look like a spaniard to me oo
why is the country divided about this subject a country has the right to patrol its borders and prosecute those who conspire to skip the process illegal immigration hurts the lower and middle classwtf am i missing if youre a liberal and identify with the victim mentality voting for illegal immigration is voting against your best interestim ever confused by sjws
i fully support an xgammasolarfluxcapacitorvegancrystalforcefieldchipimplanter wall give this guy all the medals hes a genius
507 this guy definitely has some native in him because thats not what fullblooded spaniards look like
that was the dumbest shit i ever heard  wtf 
holy shit that second guy had me laughing my ass off talk about a moon bad
what an idiot
was that guy on meth
can you maybe tell me where you get your statistics i need them for a presentation
so many of these people are just idiots like out of all the change my minds this has to be the most brain melting one
these people vote the end is near
build that wall
can you believe do a there is no god change my mind 
guy a wall will never work same guy  a digital scanner wall with imbedded tags in every person that may cross is a simple solution
lol a x ray boarder
this is my thing with the wall i believe the idea of it is stronger than its actual implementation it allows us to find our newest scapegoat im not saying illegal immigration shouldnt be addressed i just believe the time and money it requires could be better implemented we have a horrible infrastructure roads bridges trains compared to other developed countries i believe the jobs and benefits from helping our actual infrastructure will be more beneficial than building a wall our money has literally no inherent value and the middle class pays the majority of the countrys taxes i think fixing these problems should be our focus the problem is that the government is so corrupt the real problems will never be addressed both sides dont give a shit about you they just have slightly different methods of gaining and maintaining power
why not just end the wellfare state and the war on drugs
x rays to register you xd
can you please do one called abortion is bad change my mind
we could have superman sit at the border and xray vision all the immigrants easy fix
an xray machine   love it
that guy who said hes not mexican hes spanish is deluded beyond belief
an x ray boarder  god bless him for at least think about this but as usual their thoughts in their head make no sense or are they logical  wow  every country has a boarder  some just do not have the money to protect it  i love how these people think that open boarders is going to solve all the worlds issues  yet they say let them all in  yet have no idea what to do with them once they are here  but one thing we do know is the american tax payer pays out billions in welfare yet they pay just millions in tax  we have an unemployment rate that is always at least 5  do some math  what is 5 of 360 million  of all these people that want open boarders and let em all in yet they are not the ones growing food creating jobs creating housing create energy resources cleaning our water providing security through police putting drug lords  rapists criminals and other illegals in jail and so on  they have no solution except let them all in  but what they do expect is someone else to come up with the food the housing jobs energy and so on  it is not their job but someone else job  tell you what when you become a farmer create thousands of jobs become a police officer become a doctor and so on to offer any type of solution to deal with these illegals i promise to try and take you seriously on this issue  ideally it would be nice to live as a structured society  but not every country is like that  and those countries are like that because of the people you want to bring in here  fact is there are criminals drug lords rapists robbers lazy people dependable people and so on  are you suggesting that just because there are only thousands of these people that does not justify wanting to know which ones are here or going to be here  bet you would change your mind if an illegal that other wise would have been controlled through security and secure boarders killed a family member you would be the first one demanding justice  you want to take guns away from the very few that do so called mass shootings which make a very small percentage of gun owners and even small percentage of legal gun owners and you want to regulate them  yet a higher percentage of criminals cross our boarder but because there way more hard workers then criminals you want to give them a pass and not find out who is the criminal  how does that work exactly
im just making up a number but lets say i believe 5 of people coming here illegally live lives of crime the fact is 999 of the people coming here who live lives of crime come here illegally just because 95 of the overall number dont doesnt mean the 5 should get a free pass i dont know how this makes me racist but apparently it does but i believe we should streamline our system so that people can get to the country quickly and a lot more affordably and secure our border that way the people who come here to have a better life dont need to worry about coming here with the 5 that are rapists murderers pedofiles and thugs we want your tired your hungry and your poor we do not want your criminals your deviance your rapist and your murderers and i dont care what race or what country you come from
literally everyone here is a dumb fuck steven crowder his fans and the idiots in the video because if anyone did make a good argument he wouldnt show it
we shouldnt have a secure border we should just have  proceeds to literally explain what a secure border is
you hear they pay there taxes they make money and use that money in there communities i see this everyday  they keep that money with the  latino communities they have bought there own  grocery stores bakeries  auto sales lots  home repair  you name they have just where i live in south carolina the whole west side of town has become mexico they have semi trucks from mexico delivering food for the there grocery stores  as businesses move out they take it over if you go there to apply for a job  they dont hire americans they tell you that right front the legal mexicans are getting the business license to operate a business for the illegals you go to walmart on friday night there are lines of  latinos sending money to mexico all the signs on these business are in spanish  the only thing i can read is the phone number so for these  politicians to say that they are contributing to our societie someone please tell me how that money is gotten fromsny source thrre but that money is not put back into our community  it stays within theres it mexico thats the reason mexico doesnt want to solve this problem is because of the billions of dollars that goes to mexico
new mexico is a sanctuary city and we need xrays to identify people ew
ahhhh another new mexican making our state proud 
the dude is far too idealiatic we have to understand not everyone is as open as those in the west there are currently too many political cultural and religious conflict for borders to be erased even if people can coexist no borders would mean no countries and the demise of tradition and cultures
tag us like dogs  thatll work  lol
illegals do pay taxes change my mind
debating unprepared random people and young students still trying to figure out life and who they are crowder is really brave isnt he what a dweeb
do a fat acceptance is death acceptance change my mind
we should have an electron microscope border that way we could see anything and everything coming into our country science
smh
i read this title and immidiatly began dying of laughter build the wall  change my mind lool
illegal and legal is no difference change my mind
a popular argument against the wall is how much money it will cost but i think the motive is they dont want illegal crossings to be enforced
we definitely should have a more secure border illegal immigration is a problem having checkpoints coming across would help a lot but my questions for a wall is how are we going to pay for it if we build a wall unless its massive costing more money would it prevent people from getting through
and 100 of illegals are law breakers  there are immigration laws and when they are ignored and they break into the country that makes them law breakers  it does not matter what percent are committing crimes  the fact remains they are  we do not have a clue who is coming in  we have a right to know who is coming in  and just because you try and justify it and say they are hard workers and just want to better their family fact remains they are not all like that  fact remains that the fact they broke in this country makes them a criminal  we have a right to know who is coming in this country  i never understood how these open boarder people try to justify that only a small percentage are criminals  and you know thathow  because pedro works with me and i know everything i need to know because he works hard  yet you cannot provide a background check  how many people in your work place have a public background check that you know  yet you think you can justify illegals and know everything about them because they chop lettuce and cut grass  the wall in itself will not solve the boarder issues by itself  but it will make it harder  there needs to be 247 armed boarder agents and military  mayors who provide sanctuary cities need to be arrested and thrown in prison  there needs to be better education on reporting illegal aliens  stiffer crimes for people that employee illegals  stop chain migration which includes gain citizenship just because a person is born here  their parents need to be legal citizens  and so many other things  no welfare under any condition  but society needs to start reporting illegals  these illegals need to know that they are not safe  and anyone who harbors them government or society needs to be arrested that does  we want legal immigrants  but only those who can contribute to society and not suck it dry and drink all the bottle water
i dont think the second guy understood what he was talking about he wants to put xrays at the border but have no wall or way to get people through the xrays it makes absolutely no sense
where can i find some of these statistics
is that an r32 in the background
its too bad no one really wanted to sit down for this one  i would really like to see opinions on this from both sides  im on the fence about a physical wall right now but im completely for boarder control and reducing the amount of illegal immigrants  just like its not fair to us citizens and to those who wish to be through the legal routes  i would like to look into other countries and how they deal with citizenship  if i as a us citizen wanted to immigrate to a country in europe or japan would i have an easier time than those who want to enter the us or would it be just as restrictive  i think i may find that the us is not alone in this
build the wall
the the spanish guy provided the epitome of an emotional argument
dear mexico please stop bringing your dirt weed into america we good
this one is easy i guess you didnt know that people who live in mexico can dig build a wall so they can dig right under it if you want to be right you should say build a moat with alligators in it if you dont think its true ask el chapo httpcontenttimecomtimephotogallery029307189541800htm lif facts wont change your mind nothing will
this guy is the epedime of a fucking idiot he has some end goal without any thought to the process this is a great example to the decline of western culture he explains a border without supporting it openly wow
plot twist the spanish guy is actually an illegal mexican
build the wall with your ass bitch id like to see that actually
a fucking xray border 
the spanish dude just walked into the wrong classroom
644  um  i dont know about that 37 of the murders are caused by the 35 illegal immigrantsthe way he worded it seems very suspect
this dude is soooo stupid 
i know exactly whats going on in the streets alot of the mexicans are even getting strung out on dope they sell and buy foodstamps they even go around offering addicts 150000 for a copy of their birth certificates and ssc cmon bro this guys an uneducateduninformed moron ive even heard alot of them admit they have kids here to anchor them here 1 out of 10 of those tuckers are alright my ppl come from spain too and we didnt establish the first capitol of the new world so strangers can come into our homes and eat our food like it was theirs dont tread on me and stop bitching about how bad you have it here tuckers
that mexican guy has no idea what he is talking about
cool shoes steven
theres plenty of messed of shit already in america more wont hurt lol
the guy from nm dont know shit im from nm too and ive worked i  the construction industry ive even worked at walmart and the majority just to make money use fake names ssn etc and bullshit that they pay taxes they can go to the welfare office and ask for emergency assistance and their given a temp id number where they can use for bank accounts loans etc what alot of americans cant attain just by changing their name this dudes a moron hes on some mexican drugs
i love how literally every person that sat down interpreted this completely wrong and merely thought that the issue at hand literally building the wall despite there technically already being a wall and a heavily policed border between america and mexico and ultimately meaning that regardless illegal immigrants will still be able to find a way into the country the wall represents a farright controversial stance on americas immigration policies specifically the processing of illegal and legal immigrants in the us so harsher bordercontrol basically thats what should have been discussed not whether or not the immigrants will find an alternative method to cross the border which they obviously will
is it me or does that boy sound like a ol stoner from the seventies open boarders manthey just come over with xray things man id have to talk it  over with smart scientist people man i gonna be govener one day man i not tryin to be mean but lay off the smoke if your gonna try an have an intelligent conversation
id like to see you debate people who are experts in their area anybody can debate another who is uninformed
like if kd ruined illegal immigration
should have blurred her moreanybody living in that area would be able to see her name tag and the brand image on it and make a connectionfor her own safety please censor her appearance more for example youve left her handbag totally unblurred  something which she would likely carry everywhere and would be a part of her identity
wall of xrays  border wall
no wall motion activated 50cal turrets spaced every 12 m natural selection takes over
635 wrong according to the cato institute illegal immigrants are 25 less likely to commit homicide 115 less likely to commit sexual assault and 79 less likely to commit larceny httpswwwcatoorgpublicationsimmigrationresearchpolicybriefcriminalimmigrantstexasillegalimmigrantfull827 also wrong according to homeland in 2017 border apprehensions were at a 46year low httpswwwcbpgovsitesdefaultfilesassetsdocuments2017deccbpbordersecurityreportfy2017pdfbuilding a wall is pure stupidity it would cost billions i thought you wanted less government spending  stevie and it wont accomplish anything border walls dont havent and will never work people always find ways to get into the country httpswwwmigrationpolicyorgarticlebordersandwallsdobarriersdeterunauthorizedmigration expedited removal is indisputably the best way to tackle illegal crossings its literally that fucking simple
1318 lol
blur out her work id
why didnt you interview for more people why just an idiot and someone who didnt explain things very well
mexicans have better work ethics than americans change my mind
can someone else explain to me an aspect of sanctuary citiesif a city  and police department  choose to be a sanctuary city does that mean they refuse to cooperate with ice  and any other agency  on the primary basis that they wont go after any persons of interest solely because they are undocumentedif ice contacts a police department of a sanctuary city and says we are looking for x this person is wanted for murder will said police department refuse to aid in the apprehension of this person because they are undocumented
what do these people think of the wall between israel and egypt
you dont show people that are ready for the conversation these people know what they want to say but  they are nervous show the people that can actually make you and your veiwers think i dont agree with you at all but i still watch peace
this guy as the governor jess
where did you get your crime statistics  interested for a project
steven is stupid coming from a mexican latin whatever you call it change my mind
ah yes thousands of miles of xray scanners why didnt i think of this i almost couldnt watch this i could feel my brain cells dying at an exponential rate during this video 
alot of people in the media and society seem to missing the keyword in illegal immigration also the issues that having an unsecured border brings
idk i one day plan on being the governer of new mexico asblksbdtgkllgjkk
put gun turrets on the wall too
that look at the end was priceless
build the wall and put really really high voltage wires or something on top of it so that if somebody tries to climb over it they drop dead
one problem with the wall there are already walls in which people can use ladders to climb over
these stats cannot be right
that 2nd person was a complete idiot
the only antiwall reason i can think of is money the financing of the wall would be incredible
when that 2nd guy came in supporting technology am remembering that video where a indivdiual goes walking up to people with the sign saying technology and he screams technology then the people ran away spooked

forget the monetary angle a wall is just fucking stupid and wont actually do anything it will literally change nothing just like how banning drugs changed nothing dumbass neo cons and their retarded logic that banning or walling off things produces positive results these old fools have to die sooner or later and hopefully once theyre gone we can actually get some shit done in this country if its even around at that point

an explanation as for why youre going into the country as well as means to track when a person comes in and out of the country did he just describe a border checkpoint and a passport
i dont think he thinks before he speaks and if he does wow i dont think i will ever visit nm 
do a the earth isnt flat
build the wall and people will just dig holesthe wall is just a wall of hateand its a waste a money
ehm how about the people running away from war the ones who want to live work be happy with their families and live how about those who cant enter the country legally because theyve lost everything in war escaping with only their clothes tell me
i am not against the idea of stopping illegal immigrants even the wall is an idea that can be considered the problem with trumps wall is that its a bad business model when the initial stats came out regarding building 30 foot hight wall across the border it costs well over billions of dollars who is going to finance it  trump clearly is not smart enough to convince the mexican president and their people to pay for it that leaves americans to pay to build the way which means high taxes and bad economy a better plan is needed
im not saying dont build the wall but theres some logistical problems with it one is that airplanes can go over a wall why is that important most of our illegal immigrants came here legally and overstayed their visas another is just the ridiculously vast length the wall has to be and the insanely remote and treacherous terrain that needs to be overcome just to get men and materials to the site consider this how many trust the federal government to build them a house now imagine that house is going to be built on a remote desert mountain id trust fart after laxative laced mexican tap water before i trusted the structural integrity of that the last one our nations infrastructure is outdated and crumbling all around us imagine the improvements to those things that could be made with the kind of manpower materials and money its going to take to build that wall maga or just change the g to a b for border instead
lets do with xrays what we can do with bricksits far more efficient xp
can you find better guests next time it seems like all of the people you interview in these pieces are of low intelligence and uneducated  this would be far more interesting if you found people who had a clue what they were talking about
too many uneducated buildthewall
oh fuck no offense to this fella  i wouldnt allow him to be a governor of any kind because he seems unintelligent and foolish and i live in ireland seriously americans need a kick up the arse to get a reality check  their country is so hollywood so exaggerated so deluded my advice cop the fuck on and act like a man
this guy cant even form a complete thought let alone a complete sentence jesus that was hard to watch
first of all just the monstorous burden of cost of the us government building a wall immediately makes it a bad idea  how about instead of wasting billions of dollars of us tax payer dollars on the wall we just stop subsidizing immigration and get rid of the welfare state and anyone that wants to come here to make a better life for themselves is more then welcomeimmigration is a private property issue imho
my god that guy was stupid
so this guy is recommending that all mexicans get chips implanted in them so that we can keep track of all brown people coming and going
building a wall is too invasive instead lets xray people and track them 
the second guy is nuts lol
where i work i get a lot of spanish guys honduras guatemala coming in looking for truck parts but i swear on my mothers life and im a big mommys boy half if not more than half of these men that barely speak english all think the wall is a good idea you know why because those men that come in live in bad areas on long island and there true americans that just want to raise a family and work hard but its so bad in there areas and they see the gangs and kids how there just lazy and want to steal everything in life those men that come into the shop are americans they love this country but more important they see all the cnn bs and there family and where they live to be safe
he just chose the dumbest guest most people have good logical arguments why not to build the wall this is bias
im an immigrant a legal one build that wall
geez that guy on 2nd was fucking retardeditd be nice if reasonably intelligent people sat down to talk more often
2pac isnt dead change my mind
why is her soda  201 have a plant in it
why not just legalize drugs make employers pay all immigrants minimum wage and tax them just like they do everyone else then we dont need a wall
why would u support trump building a wall when theres no guarentee the next president wont be on some hitler shit or who knows even trump could be on that now where tf mfs gone go when shit get to going to shit cant escape the american govt if they the mfs opening and closing the huge ass fucking wall cus canada forsure aint letting mfas in
the berlin wall would be perfect
okay heres the thing the best way to deter illegal immigration is by making it much easier to get here legally as long as there are poor conditions to escape and the united states takes years to even look at the immigration applications people will come illegally but heres another thing with how shitty the us is at legally allowing people to come there needs to be less stigma with illegal immigrants they are not criminals rather the majority are hard working and willing to do hard work for little pay just for a better life for their kids not just that undocumented immigrants make up a massive part of our economy rather than condemning them for trying to escape violence and poverty we should be thanking them for being willing to do such hard work without complaining the wall would cost so much not only to build but also would cost a lot to our economy in the long run in immigrant labor the best way to deter illegal immigration is by making it easy to legally migrate especially because that boosts economic growth by immigrant labor considerably and monitoring the bad guys at the border becomes much cheaper and easier since the numbers of illegal migrants drops significantly and we save the cost of building the border on taxpayers that doesnt solve the problem completely and it may take years  before its effective but its so much better than just saying fuck it lets build a wall
the guy in the white shirt has no idea what he is talking about
this isnt  a joint in the cup holder this is entering a fucking country illegally
your eyes at the end so many words displayed beautifully handled
i dont wanna troll the guy but he said he is spanish but his family has been living in mexico for like 450 years dog youre mexican
these peoples votes have the same weight as mine
i love the idea of banning illegal immigration i disagree however with building a wall i dont have a problem with creating efforts to block out illegals but the price of building a wall is absolutely astronomical where do we get the money
if this guy didnt change your mind no one will
i dont want the wall built it will cost way too much plus most immigrants come from planesboats just seem a waste of money ps good vid keep it up
how about im a republican change mind
that guy leroy must be doing some harsh sniffing drug he made me laugh though
im 100 against the wall i wish i could have been on this change my mind a wall makes absolutely no fiscal sense a wall could be climbed over or undereditthere is already a partial wall
2nd dude is on dope as a former addict i can see them coming from a mile away
electric fences would be soo much more entertaining than a wall
please do another one of these this dude made 0 sense
that lady was just dumb she is the epitome of the liberal mindset they are low iq grossly misinformeduninformed and talk and act as though they are informed it is absolutely infuriating they listen to the mainstream media who do nothing but lie trick and deceive the uneducated pop culture addicted easily brainwashed simpletons of our society these people have bought the great lie as christ predicted and are brainwashed into hating their own country and people they have been fooled into believing what is good is evil and vice versa another prediction of christ liberal brainwashed simpleton who argues against reality logic and facts with emotions stirred up by hollywood music industry mainstream media and democratic party conservative normal human being god bless all
that dudes a fucking idiot he needs to stop watching west world and altered carbon and realise what year it is dude spoke out of his ass for 10 min about futuristic xray borders and data chip tracking im always so amazed at how stupid all these people are
crowderyou need some longer shorts
i literally just face palmed most of what leeroy said please please get him back on
that lady knows exactly whats wrong seeing illegal immigrants in her neighborhood shes afraid to say anything though
the level of stupid in our country should be our first order of business however cnn loves stupid so they will keep feeding their followers moronic ideas to sell ad space you can tell these people have no thoughts of their own everything they say is a tidbit from a news article or social media post unreal
last guy was absolutely sht deport him
the nonmexicannew mexico dude is a complete moronwhen i hear this kind of stupidity that sympathizes with criminals im with trumpbuild the damn wall
cringe af i have no idea what that dude was talking about
the dude is a moron why would you sit down and spill the beans on your stupidity i think you nailed it though go ahead and gather a group of people to talk about it and then talk to engineers go ahead and do that then come on back when your ready
this channels good cause i agree with most do your points and topics but fuck your wall puto
an xray scanner haha this guy been watching too much scifi he getting confused between tv and reality
that guy was so stupid i actually thought he was trolling at one point
i love your videos steven but i heard you say once that you were christiana lot of us would love to hear you discuss with an atheist like matt dillahunty on defending your reasons for being a theist you cant possibly be this anal in pointing out flaws in other peoples intellectual honesty through rational thought processes and arguments based on reason to then just completely avoid the sore thumb flaw in your belief system if youre such a reasonable person drop the religious baggage or change my mind
i dont get why the us is getting all the blame why not  mexico why are a lot of people risking their lives to come here why arent people protesting and burning mexican  flags i think its time to turn the blame to the  real problem why try to change america instead of changing mexico for the better so people wouldnt have to leave home for a better life
honestly lets just make a dmz between us
i would like to point out that mexico built a wall on their southern border and obama helped them pay for it
leroy trujillo for president his ideas are too good for just new mexico
i will copy change my mind here in brazil bro its ok for you
dont waste our money building a wall instead waste our money building an xray wall lol cause that would be way cheaper just a few hundred miles of xray scanners lmaoroflcopter some people are just stupid
walls dont stop planes before watching the full video im guessing no one brings this up
what surprises me most about this video is how both of them were for the wall but still say theyre against the wall xd
why is a canadian so worried about the us
i just think its stupid to spend that mount of money on a wall when they could spend it on helping the us citizens they are trying to protect
httpswwwwashingtonpostcomnewswonkwp20180619twochartsdemolishthenotionthatimmigrantshereillegallycommitmorecrimenoredirectonutmterm01c164232b90im just curious as to what source steven got his stats from indicating that illegal immigrants disproportionately commit more heinous crimes relative to actual citizens
xray gate xd nuuuurrrrrrrrrr
were gunna build a giant xray around america 
how do you have  gate to go through without  a wall
is that second interviewee in college  hes barely cogent  good luck new mexico if you ever elect this guy to any office
23 of illegal immigrants do not cross the border illegally  they come to the us through work visas then dont return after they expire  so most illegal immigrants actually do enter the country legally they just dont leave  i think money could be better spent elsewhere than on a wall  also the wall will not stop the flow of drugs due to the fact that most drugs are smuggled in via tunnel or boat
speaking of illegal drugs
956 documentation  bizzactly
too many stupid people they need to die for the greater good for civilization
anytime you hear steven talk about stats ignore him if you torture numbers enough they will confess to anything put that money into stopping the war on drugs people are fleeing south america because of the drug war it is just like prohibition was in the 1920s with the mob end the war on drugs that will take away the money that these gangs kill each other over take away their funding in general that will make people not have to leave south america in such high numbers and it will relieve our police departments building the wall does nothing to fix the root of the problem what happens when they spend billions on the wall and it doesnt work they will just blame the democrats
you know who else built a wall nazis
a  wall isnt going to help it is just a waste of money nobody wants criminals coming here but a wall is just a waste spend that money on laws and legislation that actually works most illegals come on planes or through visas
i really like this guy but is he really supporting that wall movement
war in syria would cost as much as 10 walls
bring back yusef
new mexico is in trouble with that guy lol
in my opinion it would be unecessary to build the wall because they would find a way to come one way or another just as the lady said
im against illegale imigration but isnt building the wall fucking retarded costs a fuckload of tax money and it wont really be that efficienti dont live in america so i am i missing something
ahahahahaha why should we keep illegal immigrants just tax em give them citizenship and tax em
im not for the wall im for the great wall of merica fuuuuuuck yeahhhhhhh
we americans should not allow jews and other mud races into our country period
i my teacher once told us that building a wall would make mexicans think we dont want them and it will make them sad he then went on a rant about my capitalism sucks
the left couldnt careless about this women here legally they figure theyve already got their votes so the left is illegally stockpiling illegal voters for the future the left is really a crime syndicate family trafficking in humans isnt human trafficking illegal crooked hillary got away with crimes so i guess their all in the clear  unless we all vote republican this midterm
always impressed with stevens calmness and great communication skills while being open minded
rip xxxtentacion
im latin and that guy is fucking stupid and im embarrassed for him
that guy took a bump right before this
this kid will also be on the next episode called dont do drugs change my mind
do a change my mind the earth is round
xray wall
lol  that last guy was unintelligible  love how steven just let him talk
does anyone know if disney is buying fox news in the big 21 century fox deal i heard it was going to be called new fox news if disney own fox their will no longer be a conservative news network just heard it and was wondering thnxz
the security was a good idea
new mexico is the most uneducated state in the us
we dont need a physical wall we need an xray scanner that is also somehow able to read id tags and track people everywhere they go that is much less invasive than a wall and these borders people speak about we just need a few masterminds to come up with it
youre arguing against idiots
300 see thats the type of silence that allows these criminals to take advantage of good hard working people the wall wont do much to the crime rate but it will force more enforcement in the border
2 morning milk is better than 1 milkchange my mind
was that first girl drinking a damn tree lmao
woman if they build a wall they will still find other ways to get insteven yeah but you already said youre against them coming in and you want to find a way to stop themthis is the same thing as a person who says if we ban guns they will still find other ways of committing acts of violenceand them someone else responding with but youve already admitted you dont like acts of violence and want to stop themyeah dude i just told you that way doesnt work are you listening
free flowing xray borderslove the future governer of new mexico
jesus i think i actually got dumber from watching this first off you only showed the most incoherent scattered brain arguments to oppose your views and make you look smarter then you just make up facts to support your views that are not supported by any actual evidence your claim illegal immigrants commit crimes at a disproportionate rate is a blatant lie and here is a study from oxford that shows youre full of shit httpcriminologyoxfordrecomview101093acrefore97801902640790010001acrefore9780190264079e93
pineapple doesnt go on pizzachange my mind
all illegal drugs should be legalized and all legal drugs should be prohibited change my mind
looks like were building a wall
crowder this change your mind is really misleading we have a wall so are you saying build the wall trump wants or that we should or shouldnt have a wall honestly we dont need a super expensive wall just more border agents and money used to help them better patrol those areas
didnt change my mind build the wall
building a wall will not solve the problem  most illegals are not mexicans  it is time to treat illegals like criminals  stop giving them our resources and kick them out of the country  if they come back they go to prison for a while then get kicked out again  if they come back after that keep them in prison for even a longer period of time
walls historically dont work when we put up the border fence in 2005 all it did was demotivate mexican illegals from going home the number of illegals in america increased in the next couple years by 250 here is a proper video about how well walls workhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvafvenwfeghw
electronic id tag slaves be lovin their enslavement iron chains are barbaric but electronic ones meh not so much
that guy was brilliant he makes diane abott uk politician look like a genius
i cant wait for crowders next video titled putting kids in concentration camps is ethical change my mind
all white people are racist change my mind
god is alive change my mind
haha scientifical
arent the majority of illegals here the results of over staying their visas
man that  guys iq is his shoe size
here is my question you dumb ignorant person how do you make people walk through your xray gate if theres no walls blocking them from going aroundplease find a different job idea you are not fit to be the governor of the hallway in the apartment building you live in maybe you can be a cop or a manager in a fast food restaurant they are always  willing to lower their standards to let in more diversity
subscribe to my youtube channel  change my mind
love the mexican people and most all the countries in south america the issue is securing the nation a nation without security is synonymous to a house without a doors or locks who in the right mind would like to live in a house with no security  the idea of saying yes i agree we need to make people register legally to be in the us but i dont believe we need to have walls is either trying to stay on both sides subconsciously or lying to themselves  its like drinking a diet drink but regularly eating unhealthy high calorie meals what good would that do  the real reason the democrats pander to the illegals is they know they will be a source of future votes  lets call a spade a spade
yousef at uiuc was destroying crowder before he crowder sent him away for being mean look at the video if you dont believe me
drugsuh
ive watched enough vox to know its just another propaganda outlet to tell us what to think  crowder should set up shop in dc and hit up politians
2 reasons why you shouldnt build the wall1 itll put the us trillions of dollars in debt2 it wont work migrants will just cross the gulf of mexico in boats
she tries to cover the microphone and thinks it works xd
please do change my mind police are not killing black people 4 no reason but racism
i feel like the issue was hardly argued
xvideos is better than pornhub change my mind
im a us citizen with family in mexico i visit them often in mexico a funny thing happens when i come back home i present my documents at a point of entry and am let back in to the us my point is that the fear that you wont be able to come back to the us if youre legal is absurd
these sitdowns were pathetic i mean most people walk up to this pavillion randomly not having prepared anything on the topic and face off against a wellspoken pundit who has prepared for these talks yeah its not really fair for them and crowder controls the editing but still those opinions were weak as fuck ill bet these people came up with better positions 5 minutes after walking awayheres the reason the wall is stupid its economically inefficient its insulting to mexico our ally for now and its fairly ineffective given what trump purports that it will do1 the wall is costly were talking many billions we could put all our illegal immigrants on perpetual welfare for that kind of money its also extremely costly to lock them up in detention centers it costs more than many hotels deportation plain and simple is the most costeffective way to limit and deter illegal immigration which is why obama was dubbed deporter in chief and mexico will never pay for the wall anyone who believed trump when he said that is an idiot what would force mexico to pay eh nothing thats what2 its not physically possible along the entire border there are areas with a giant river and areas with mountains its not actually necessary to build walls in locations where there are natural boundaries and would be a waste of money to essentially double up those defenses which would then also need to be maintained3 wall prototypes are weak just watch penn  tellers episode of bullshit about immigration they tear the idea of a wall to shreds literally and this was long before trump they get a few illegal mexican workers to build a section of wall not fence that was proposed by the bush admin and then at the end of the day tell these mexicans they need to get over under and through the wall some tin snips a shovel and a blanket to cover the barbed wire were all that was needed took all of them less than 5 minutes to get through regardless of the route they took in fact going over the wall seemed to be tougher than going under or through it now you want to make that wall even more robust and impenetrable okay then see issue 1 above every panel every stick every roll of wire and every rock placed costs taxpayers4 people who live along the border even those who voted for trump hate the idea of building a wall there because of geographical considerations the wall would have to be moved back in many areas ceding ground to mexico and even cutting properties of american residents there in half some if the proposed wall were built in some areas would find themselves on the other side of that wall and these are white american citizens middle class home owners that were talking about those closest dont even want it so that should tell you something5 more immigrants have been leaving the us than entering it we have been experiencing a net loss over the last decade there is no sound premise that makes building the wall a good idea because its addressing a problem that basically doesnt exist its an answer to a question no one askedhttpswwwwashingtonpostcomnewsworldviewswp20170127evenbeforetrumpmoremexicanswereleavingtheusthanarrivingutmterm68e5104113e26 crowder is pulling some strange numbers out there saying that immigrants commit more crime than citizens i want to see his source for those numbers the studies i can find conclude the opposite that immigrants are overall less likely to commit crimes  and why wouldnt they they have more to lose if caught than the average citizenhttpswwwwashingtonpostcomnewswonkwp20180619twochartsdemolishthenotionthatimmigrantshereillegallycommitmorecrimeutmterm2da53c5b7998so in short the wall is a stupid waste of money thats why it should not be built because id rather have my taxes go to nonstupid things if at all possible and im surprised that there are so many trumptards out there who dont see it that way i guess for them fear beats representative taxationif anyone has issues with leftwing washington post fine show me your sources that contradict them and ill take a look just dont use that as an excuse to quickly conclude fake news and walk away like an intellectually apathetic cuck
its unfortunate that this is the best content you got
that guy is really retarded there are so many big holes in his story its amazing somebody with his intellect hasnt died from bad decisions
holy shit that mexican dude is hilarious reminds me of a schizo on the bus
essentially straw man arguments why dont you get experts put together a panel of moderate thinkers
x ray boarder
its bad vs good
i could argue the point better but i actually disagree with the position of open borders and not building a physical wall to deter illegal migration its a pipe dream to think transportation will improve greatly within our lifetime cars mass transportation and international travel have no realistic cost effective upcoming technology that will make drastic change drugs have been given lip service by our officials for the longest but if a concrete potential solution like a wall or enforcement of currently ignored laws come up people panic it makes no sense to not use common sense
pretty sure youre just handpicking the people with the worst opinions to further your point
youre the man crowder you execute you point of view perfectly and seem to stump people on basic knowledge
this guy should be an add as to why we shouldnt perscribe adderal
scientifical
okay lets make all the mexican immigrants write an essay but because most of them cant read or write they wont be able to get through ha thatll get em
how is someone so dumb willing to sit down and get schooled in front of thousands
lol the guy arguing against the wall is unknowingly prowall
708 i absolutely do not commit any crimes dullardin fact i think ive been a much better person because of trump and everyone knowing i support trump im always on my best behavior
these guests were pretty dense
jesus this guy is the dumbest fuck ever
globalists are delusional and no nothing about human history
i couldnt even watch this one because the spanish dude was so irritating
crowder do you give these people aptitude tests to see how inept they are
building a wall is simply going to cost a fuck tone mexico is not going to pay for it this wall would have to be built through some rivers lakes which would just make it more difficult to build building a wall is not going to stop mexicans from coming into the united states through out humanity i think its been very clear that humans allways find a way to go overcome obstacles there for making the wall close to useless if not usless not to mention how much it would cost to build such a wall i think it would be a way better idea to invest in the border patrol to create more jobs in that field to create a system to invest in migration centers that could also create jobs etc i also wanted to note that it is just wrong for the united states to not receive immigrants i honestly believe that there are several really hard working mexicans that can make the united states a better place of course there is always unethical people in every nation but if we create a a better or improve the system that we have right now we could filter out the bad from the good
that one guy basically said make the illegals go through the system legally how are we going to make them do that they came here illegally to avoid all of that and if they are undocumented then we cant really just greet them and say ok its time to pay taxes because we dont know where they are or who they are
hey stevencrowder i have something that might interest you httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvsfac67rqtzqthis link has a video with a counter argument to the wall dont worry he is a ancap so you shouldnt have much of a problem with him by the way ancap means anarchy capitalist
if i saw steven crowder at a university or street corner and saw him sitting with his change my mind kiosk and i was undecided on a particular issue would i be able to go up to him and ask him what reasons he has to believe such conclusions or does he only accept people who are ready to change his mind
been in new mexico since 1550s at one point his family lived under the mexican government so some of his family are born mexicans lol
i can support better immigration laws but building a wall is just idiotic you gotta realize that it would take millions upon millions of dollars to build and then even more to maintain it and for what to increase the sales of ladders and rope because thats all building a freaking wall is going to do not to mention how a majority of immigrants are just overstaying their visas
i am now dumber after listening to this guy talk
stevens such a dick
if you think the whole rhetoric of the wall and its purpose is really about protecting the border you are either naive dumb or a bully
first let me say i am against a wall i will watch your video to see your points  i think a better immigratio policy but our money needs to go to somthing else being s husband to  immigrant from peru she went through all the naturalization and became a resident and pays her taxes knows english better than most and is very educated what are your thoughts on that bud also the majority of immigrants come on work visas etc and stay longer then they are here so a wall or stronger border will not stop the 60 of immigrants coming on through a plane staying fr a year or more then never going back tell me how a wall will stop that
his horrified look at the end was priceless lmfao
he said they bring in drugs coyotes ect he said that today fact check ur devoted love to trump
we need more drugs in this country its getting harder every day to get what i want just make them legal already fuck i could go for some oxy right now
dont build the wall i need to keep my illegal mexican gardener maid farmer and nanny for my family low wages and huge profit to my business i love this country
leeroy is a fucking idiot
congrats on 2 million subscribers this show is phenomenal
did he just say free thought  lol why am i listening to that guy talk he doesnt know shit
austin does not represent the views of the rest of our state they are anomalies
big fan of you crowder i agree with you on most things but this change my mind was a really poor one on both parts in reality the wall would be a money pit
that guy makes my head hurt we should have no borders and xray machines that track people that come here hes trying way too hard to sound like someone with deep thoughts
yo just subscribed
im happy that he has a goal to become governor of new mexico but i hope he never becomes governor of new mexico
this just sucks no good argument was raised against the wall itself when and where are these done im getting the sense that grabbing people off the street in the middle of any given wednesday doesnt lead to an intelligent discussion
because the cost to build maintain and monitor a structure of that size is significantly higher than that of illegals sneaking inand ladders  ropes exist
lets face it were all wait for a mexican wall so it treacle down to own states having their own wall to keep others out
illegal immgriation i tend to lean more right but building wall is not cost effective at all waste of millions of tax dollars also majority of illegal immigrants are overstaying their visas and not crossing the border illegally a long term solution is too legalize the current illegal immigrants who have jobs and education and then set a standard of deporting any future illegal immigrants as much as we want to deport all of them it isnt feasible and the wall is literally a waste of money and wont really stop anyone m
governor  of new mexico the sanctuary city  wth
am i the only one cringing when i hear someone openly proposing the institutionalization of the mark of the beast from revelation wow to think people support this and even more dont recognize iti propose god exists change my mind or the bible is real change my mind
where the hell are you getting your numbers 35 are committing 37 of all homicides the highest number i found was 10 and fox news reported 5 based on 2015 numbers
why would anyone debate with steven without any sense the guy with the white t is ridiculous
you need to do we are a republic not a democracy
wondering where these stats are coming from about illegal immigrants committing violent crimes at disproportionate levels to the general populationalso just because there are some people in areas where they are being scared into not reporting illegals who are in gangs does not mean that invalidates what was reported about legals not reporting crimes to the police because they are afraid of family or friends being deported this is anecdotal stuff if im not mistaken the current statistic is that 66 of illegal immigrants are those who overstay their welcome on visitors visas i cant see how any amount of screening or border wall could keep that from happening also some of these people are incredibly desperate you think a wall is going to stop them or their smugglers from coming up with a way to get over it im sincerely trying to figure out what good an actual wall would do
35  of the population but 37 percent of murders in the usa wht lmfao that cant be a real statistic that has to be skewed and not that pointing an issue out with another race solves anything but really think of all those white collar men who pour millions into offshore accounts to avoid taxes thats probably more than any illegal avoids in taxes aside from the fact that a portion of illegals that work have fake or borrowed social security numbers and pay taxes there are still some who dont have papers or legal right to work in the usa of any kind that work under the table but also spend a majority of the money on living expenses here so it ends up being taxed in a sense i would love to see the numbers compared but im sure that would be hard to find an accurate statistic for both white collar tax evasion vs illegal immigrant tax loss but yeah that is a separate issue and im for enforcing the borders to a certain degree but in our current state in society it is a waste of money i think the idea and the perception of having a strong border is more important than actually having a secure border it is incredibly easy to cross over and relatively cheap to do so the math will never add up the immigrants will always spend a lot less money trying to cross over than it actually cost to prevent them to do so the solution might not lie on the states but their native country if you try to prevent them from crossing we will forever be in debt to a losing cause not worth it spend that money else where like education and police forces for ghetto destroyed neighborhoods rebuild broken cities
can you source your statistical arguments from more than one entity please  very annoying
new mexico 575 lol
build the fucken thing already
okay wait a minute is that guy brain dead or what how could such moronic ideas be conceived by a human brain
where is crowder getting the stat that illegal immigrants commit 37 of all homicides from everywhere i looked illegal immigrants commit fewer crimes than native born citizens including homicide one cato study showed that in texas in 2015 there were 951 homicide convictions for the year 93 885 were committed by native born citizens and 54 were committed by illegal immigrants the rates per 100000 for native citizens and illegals were 388 and 29 respectively so from what i can tell the data shows illegals commit crimes and homicides at a lower rate than natives change my mind
i see why it was so short that was painful  ugh  not worth posting  i want to hear someone with a real argument
the 1550s ok
these impoverished nations need to quit over producing their people if they are already here illegally and want stay they can opt to have their reproductive organs removed
that guy wants to be governor
alot better to watch when you dont get idiots who dont know what they are talking about
we already built a 6 billion dollar fence on the border started in 2006 and it worked so well that people dont even know it exists what happens when the 60 billion dollar wall doesnt work 600 billion dollar moat do we build the wall from game of thrones to keep out those mexican wildlings when putting your kids in timeout doesnt work you try a different punishment you dont chain them in the basement for a year
do raise us import tariffs change my mind
x ray borderand a motefiled with sharks with laser beams on their heads
steven crowder is painfully stupid and unfunny  change my mind
man  i really liked your show
what surprised me the most crowder wearing short shorts
you might want to blur her id badge lol
so lemme get this straight was leroy actually arguing for total surveillance to the point where you can track what cities people go toit seems to me that a damn wall would be preferable to the orwellian techhell which that kind of tracking and xray borders implyhe makes it sound so nice
this guy wants to chip people
the im not mexican im spanish is the argument for every mexican person who doesnt want to identify as such that dude was mexican af lol that accent come on chief
this guy writing his candidate entry for governor in crayon
a wall is absurd but an xraytype scanner covering all of thousands of miles that is feasible
net flow of illegals leaving the country is higher than coming in most illegals fly over and overstay visas instead of jumping some fence wall is a waste of money
mostly i agree with you on most topics the wall however i disagree not because of the reasons most people are against it i dont think its racist or any of the other rhetoric1 we are 21 trillion in debt and need to work on that 2 most illegal immigrants arrive by plane and overstay their visa walls wont stop that 3 boats 4 tunnels  so to make a short story long the wall is a really expensive ineffective stopgap  that if i had to guess was more about a visually symbolic monument for trumps ego than it is about actual productive immigration control
you should start with the question do you lock you doors at night  boom you want a wall if you dont trust the people right next to you why should we trust people from hundreds to thousands of miles away
if youre so worried about bridging the racial divide of this country maybe you should go troll obama hollywood the music industry can black lives matter pages believe me and my little comment alone
dang steven i had a lot of respect for you up until this video just another republic sheep listening to whatever trump says and vomiting back out with ridiculous argumentative points sad
this guy with the camera was just so stupid
my question is will building a 3 billion dollar wall really stop illegal immigrants from coming to this country
hahaha basically the guy at 1030 believes that all the illegal immigrants can be magically accounted for and can be forced to become legal technology will solve everything lol xray border lol
im a free loader and cheap prick
id like to see there isisnt a god chance my mind
lol  1800call ice
830 so we should reward people who come here illegally by letting them pass the people who are patiently waiting in line for citizenship
this guy is a loser weasel racist and a moron
kinda sounds like that dude is suggesting microchipping illegals hmmm
leroy should ease off the meth
leroy is so passionate on the issue yet has no idea what the issues are or how to address them  thats america today passion and feelings rule way too much
an xray gate wtf
future governor of new mexico 
dont vote for leroy lol
wow he just raised the bar for idiots everywhere no longer will common idiots stand out
so im curious does he actually have these views or does he propose them for the sake of argument
xray gate and hall passes problem solved
70 billion to build defeated by a 5 dollar ladder walls dont work not to mention the symbolism on one border we have a statue welcoming the poor hungry masses on another border we have a wall to keep out the poor hungry masses america
1027 crowders face trying to not burst into laughter

fake spaniard 2022  for new mexico governor
we need a pt 2 of this fast
id be curious to see your views on whether recreational drugs should be decriminalised and regulated whatever your stance id love to see if you could change my mind i believe less people would be at risk of accidental death and also the crime around drug culture could disappear
planes fly over wallsboats go around wallsa giant physical wall around the entire country would be expensiveand some bad people agree with this and if it goes through it will make them think it is a win for them which would encourage bad things
do slavery was a choice change my mind allow me to explain whyi just watched your prolife video if a woman is raped and becomes pregnant you dont believe they should abort to you this does not mean you are forcing them to keep the baby since they have a choice this would mean that even if prochoice laws were not passed that doesnt force people to keep babies and not abort they can still choose to not take care of the babywith this same thinking you would agree that slavery was a choice then right because option a vs death andor mutilation is still a choice
pretty much every study ive seen suggests that illegal immigrants commit less crimes so this 30 percent thing im not really buying
hes been watching to many science fiction movies x ray border looool
because it will cost 20 billion dollars and you guys apparently give a shit about the deficit because you would have to build the wall over mountains through villages even through a national park because we net loose immigrants each year and this isnt a real problem because it was just a giant scam to get trump elected and he has no intentions of building this thing whatsoever steven crowder is a failed comedian who sold his soul to the koch bros in order to pay the bills change my mind
i feel bad for the first lady  im currently living in evergreen alabama but when i first was legally approved to live in this country i lived on chicagos south side  i know what its like to not feel safe in your own neighborhood
hey steven i was wondering if you can answer a question for me recently i watched an interview with jordan peterson about compelled speech and the argument was presented that should people be able to refuse service to black people if so whyespecially since not letting people refuse service on the basis of race seems to have turned out to be a good thing for our country if you shouldnt be allowed to refuse on the basis of race then how is that different from forcing people to use proper pronouns hope you read this comment and thanks for all your content
xaray gates
that guy is literally proposing the government to track your every move 247 in order to defend illegals holy fuck
cock in mouth not my asschange my mind
so this guy is against keep out illegal immigrants but he is perfectly okay with implanting tracking devices in us citizens and tracking their movements my god if youre in new mexico do not vote for this guy lol
if from the first day you put your feet in another country you disrespect the law to come in what stops you from not respecting the rest of the laws the law is the law even if you are not aware of it and it applies to you even if you disagrees with it
pokballs should be colored by genderchange my mind
there are so many people who are just flat out dumb and uneducated and part of some oppressed group that the democratics just waltz in and brainwash with leftist ideology
the ignorance of people is staggering
first of enjoy your videosjust wanted to say a couple things like most illegals do pay taxes how you may ask well they get a job with a someone elses social security there for do pay taxes but also dont get any benefits like social security retirement for working under that social of corse only benefit would be to get to work
for me as a citizen of berlin i cant really understand how building a wall is an option the berlin wall got a lot of people killed if you didnt know they had spring guns and mines everywhere it was called todesstreifen which translates to death strip who says that this wall would be different i think it would be barbarous to make people fear for their lives just because they try entering a country illegally maybe some of them are criminals but even if half of them had a criminal record the other 50 were innocent people up until the point they try to cross the border illegally or not
do cultural appropriation is a good thing change my mind
i think the general public is rarely equipped with the talking ability to articulate valid counter arguments it makes these change my mind segments hard to watch i think it would help to contact some experts on the subject and also have them sit down and speak on the subjects to balance the quality of the content
okay somebody please explain why this would stop immigration no one has ever answered this question for me what is the point of something that can be defeated by a ladder or a shovel youre just throwing a billion dollars away
we might find some areas where we disagree versus where we disagree
did this guy seriously say that we would have no borders in 5 to 10 years
somebody get this spanish guy off the mic  xray backpack is this guys new name
xray scanner im out
all in all were just another brick in the wall pigeons
lol stevens face at the end 
if theres no border whats keeping them from not getting a digital tag and just walking through
ps4 is better than xbox
im waiting on this guy to upload other races are inferior to white people change my mind
 wow that guy the us cant even afford a wall and youre talking about an xray type of border how will you even scan whatever chip reading device youre talking about when they are illegal obviously youll need to get that thing in their body for it to work you honestly think someone about to illegally cross the border would come get tagged so you can spy on them while they are in the us
wow what that guy wants seems to be way worse than a wall
that guy you spoke to lowkey explained how they might bring forth the beginning of the mark of the beast
if your a legal citizen you can come back  honestly fair point mate 
build the wall with gates simple
why is this guy pretending hes not a mexican
yeah i dont at all agree with this one building a wall this scale would do nothing but cost outrageous amounts of money and really hurt the areas it is built both environmentally and civically it just doesnt seem to make much sense at all besides historically large boarder walls have proven to be almost completley ineffective in keeping out migrants one this scale would not complete the job any better and i dont really see how that isnt completley obvious besides net migration from mexico is in the negative more mexicans are leaving the states than coming in i feel like the issue of immagration has been really bloated by the american media in recent years of course we shouldnt condone illegal immagration but we should also understand that the cartels have taken control of mexico in certain areas deporting poor people and putting children in internment camps isnt going to do much to change that rather than take the iron fist approach which has never worked it is my opinion that incentives should be put in place to migrate legally the us is not an easy country to move into making it harder just makes more people migrate illegally unfortunately immagration friendly policy will never be popular in red states
steven crowder you need to try that topic again somewhere else
the governor of new mexico i hope to hell not  but who knows tons of moron apologists talk just like him
this guy wants to be governor of nmwow
just wtf wtf wtf no way this is too good
more than 75 of latinos use some form of welfare and they dont believe in or support the us constitution  thats why the political left wants an open southern border because latinos vote democrat by 3 to 1 because they want a bigger govt that gives them more stuff
always nice to get a genuine spaniards take on our immigration policy
wow 
people youre missing the biggest issue if you allow companies to keep hiring illegals they will keep sneaking in sure they have cracked down a bit  but for the most part they easily find work  or they wouldnt be coming in by the millions the argument that regular americans wouldnt do the work is nonsense when youre paying illegals under minimum wage of course nobody will apply companies obviously take advantage of the fact that they will work for peanuts thus increasing their revenue they dont have to offer insurance etc it saves them tons of money so youre saying companies that follow the rules deserve to lose to the competition
they will just make a tunnel waste of money
news flash  china already has a personal tracking system for every person in the country and it turns the whole thing into a prison without walls  it knows who you are where youve been who your friends are and much more personal information and it you  do they  only use this system to track your whereabouts  not even close  all this data assigns a score to you  that score is then given to banks credit agencies and employers who then use that number to determine if you can get a loan operate your own enterprises or even what kind of jobs you can do  weve seen what the government does with information and power  why would we ever consider giving it more of bothback on topic america is actually one of the few powerful nations without a fortress for a border wall  will people still get overunderthrough the wall somehow  of course  will they still be able to walk across the border once a 30 foot concrete structure is in place  no and that will stop all but the most determined individuals from trying to get here illegally
everytime i watch these i cringe the people that are so eager to talk never seem to have concrete points of views they have no fact based knowledge and always end up agreeing with things you say 
a country with no borders is a man with no balls 
wait i agree that some sort of secured borders should be created however why is trump making the mexicans pay for building it and anyways what if they use aeroplanes to come to america
that reminds me of listening to my buddies talk at 4am when theyre all coked out and drunkhigh
he looks like chris evans
never before have i been so powerfully aware of the central and south american contingencies of anime fans
honestlycome on crowder are you turning into some sort of trump shill its pretty self evident that this idiotic wall idea is a massive misappropriation of funds for a country already riddled with financial issues oh and historically walls dont workso theres thatget back to work with strong and balanced arguments
well you could have found someone that understands what theyre talking about good ol leroy pretty much just sold your wall for you everything he said would imply a need for a wall being built lol
dems gonna support illegal immigration in 2020 debates
not to say i support illegal immigration because i dont but do you think links to credible sources would be appropriate when used in the video very little evidence to support the 37 claim only sources i could find come from biased republican mediatrying not to fall into to the trap of blindly believing statistics that support my arguments
try your ideas on a small scale firstits called design verification test let random people into your house report the results if it doesnt work on a small scale then its just virtue signaling
i think you should have interwied berlin people theyre kind of the experts in walls
chinese build a wall once
a wall wouldnt matter because most illegal immigrants came here legally first and overstayed
your look at the end was exactly the look i had   did that just happened lol 
open borders its a fucking health risk
i dont know the proper scientifical ray thats used im impressed with steves straight face holy shit
that was one of the funniest change my minds i have ever seen
can anyone source the illegal immigrants commit 37  of homicides comment that sounds bogus or he is confused
this guy is mentally incapable for a video steven crowder love your videos alot but this is bottom of the barrel
love the whole change my mind topic i think that perhaps you should go on a tour around the more democratic states and perhaps even do one in canada would be pretty funny especially because those places have huge amounts of affirmative action
1 who is gonna pay you usa have a ridicilous dept2 a wall wont stop them desperate people are creative they will dig tunnels cross the border in boats cf europe or even cross the border in the air with old broken airplanes
100 of illegal immigrants commit at least the crime of crossing the boarder illegally
lol xray gate
oy vey goyim you dont need boarders like israel you need to pay your taxes to subsidize the importation and breeding more blacks and brownsyou have no legit concerns silly goyim we are all part of the human species and are one so boarders are badbut israel needs boarders to keep out all those damn shitty filthy palestinians
stevens look at the end lol
lol xray gate derp
how about we just dig a 40ft wide trench and fill it with spikes and razorwire on both sides so if they happen to get past the fence they have to get across the spike trench again but this time with killer bees
 2 guy is high as a kite
dude this guy he is interviewing has some kind of health issue or is under the influence  
so he is against building the wall because he thinks we should tax the immigrants the point is that you cant tax an undocumented immigrant the kind that would be prevented by building the wall he seems very much against the wall when what his actual views suggest is that he is for more relaxed immigration rules
kids in america are so soft
m8 the wall is way too expensive theres no point in building a wall i really dont think its going to help anything
building a wall and border enforcement are two very different things sir
xray wall im losing my shit 
chin chin is god change my mind
we gonna end up like in a sci fi movie with an id chip implanted at birth lol
build the wall i swear conservatives will uncritically support something just like liberals
i like how the guy is basically just trying to find a different method of controlled immigration and he resorts to a probably much more expensive and complicated method just so he can be anti wall even if it serves the exact same purpose
that 1st dude please stop talking
fascism is good change my mind
just tag all the mexicans like dogs and get them through the x ray gate its so obvious now
so here is my argument against the wall cost pure economics first anyone who bought into trump getting mexico to pay for the wall well heres your sign cliche i know but anyone who did will know what that means how much is trump looking to get for the wall now a few billion right a few billion dollars for a wall that really isnt going to work anyway i mean there are these things called shovels and ladders right ever hear about the tunnel between juarez and el paso a wall isnt really going to stop much jobs well unless more funding goes into the border patrol there wont be any more officers patrolling and any construction job will be short lived a wall alone will build quick and if trump has his way the states or local govs will be on the hook for building the wall some of these states can hardly afford to keep their roads in good repair do they have a billion or so to just throw away at a wall and keep it manned and maintained a solution take a small chunk from our over bloated defense budget and allot it to the border patrol get more agents on the ground better equipped with more modern tech like drones that can easily cover large amount of ground every day with tech that can more easily spot people than human eyes
so an even more expensive invisible wall 
its so crazy how brain washed steven is lol anyone else think its weird that he doesnt have one different opposition than the right side like not one different hmm kinda seems like its not his own thoughts and opinions and just someone elses
what the hell is this spanish kid thinking its like he skipped class to talk on this show
hes not from mexico his from spain his family has been in mexico since the 1550s
one of the few things ive disagreed with him about the entire ethos and origin of america is a multicultural multiethnic society where the only true true native americans were moved from homes and tribes relocated so the capital society could continue to grow the society was heralded as ubiquitously free in terms of society politics culture but that has never been the case even after the declaration of independence black people were still slaves the wall is a contradiction to the entire birth and origin of the nation however what stephen talks about in terms of the illegal border crossing and cross border drug trade coming from mexico and colombia as well the obvious criminal influence and lack of honest working tax paying new citizens from these countries is 100 true the reality is the amount of entry points cross the border is too vast hiring more police to control the border would cause taxes to sky rocket and poor leroy suggesting an xray id tag mechanism not only at the border but at various checkpoints in america sounds like a dystopian novel from george orwell how do you stop illegal immigration stephen probably believes that you have to make it so unbelievably difficult to cross the border ie build a wall that it just would not be worth the hassle america does have a fear of foreigners though xenophobia even though all white americans are descendants from foreign invaders but then again america never made much sense
0951 electronic id tag for immigrants  dude if trump proposed that they would call him literally hitler
the damage has already been done so fuck it
i like how everyone clapped so he could still feel special as he walked away
that second guy is fukin dumb
1140 he went full retard
jesus that guy was incredibly dumb
he rather want a fucking police state then controlling the fucking borders fucking insane motherfucker
nah  dont need a wall  landmines would probably be cheaper
if his family has been here since the 1500s why is his accent so terrible jesus hes such a disgrace
leroy needs to retake college
the problem with the execution of this format is that it doesnt welcome disagreeing politely in the first place and it doesnt provide much information to talk about the statement build a wall is a flame no one can argue about that and it blocks polite people that want to discuss and are open to change their mind no polite people comes to you if you dont approach a certain issue with the ways they want the people that this kind of communication style love are sjws ignorant feminists and overall cunts also this kind of polarizing absolutes like there are only 2 genres we need to build a wall male privilege is a myth are not good for a conversation you have to say a because afterwards and explain yourself in the very provoking statement written in the sign otherwise people cant even try to tackle the metaphorical mountain that is your opinion you have to give disagreeing people a base to start otherwise is just you with your opinion implying that everyine who disagrees is wrong i studied communication techniques so i know what im talking about youre basically asking cunts to come over and cuss you out if you want an informed discussion with nice people change the way you approach the streets that said the topics discussed here are interesting and the format is just imo badly executed but not bad per se so good job subscribed
they could just use a ladder to get over the wall
mexican guy def got it right on the opiate crisis generated by pharmaceutical companies inside the us weed traffickers are nothing compared to that
usan unos rashos laser que le salen de los ojosthis guy like that surfer guy from monsters inc in the latinamerican dub xdand he is running for major xd xd xd xd
so does that guy want bar codes tattooed on everyones foreheadthats a horrifying fantasy he has bouncing around in his noggin
so everyone has cancer when they cross the border and the left say immigrants are smart people
it should be mandatory for high school kids to learn economics a lot of the political debates that exist know what days would cease to exist
this change my mind video is stevens masterpiece lmfaoooo deaddddd
dude has a mexican accentsays hes spanishamerican from 16th century lol
that guy he talked to is absolutely retarded head zero information why bother talking to an idiot like that and by definition all illegal immigrants are criminals you are breaking the law when you cross the border illegally
how about instead of spending billions possibly trillions of dollars on a wall how about we make it easier to get a green card and make it free then also make it quicker to get here legally
sit down with john oliver
i lost it when the camera zoomed in on him at the end
steven crowder is a great guy but gives me the gets cheated on type of vibes
he might be from new mexico but he is in adderall ville during this video
adam ruins everything went over this this is old news
this isnt an insult the first lady genuinely sounds like mrs potato head
securing the border and wasting billions of taxpayer money are not the same thing really with all the technology we have there have to be better ways but i guess thats not as easy to chant as build the wallwho will pay for the upkeep mexico
interesting how there was almost no discussion about building the wall
i think it would be better to blur all of her out shes an honest person who was really looking for help it was very brave of her to do so much
wow this guy watchs too much scifi
hell i say build the wall if it doesnt work at least youll have a lot of pissed off liberals to laugh at 
i think a lot of people see the big letters saying build the wall and dont notice the change my mind and may not understand why you have it there exactly i think thays why you have less sit down discussions and more yelling
wall or not imagrants will still come illegally through airplanes or underground tunnels so for me building a wall is fucking ridiculous we should put that money into infrastructure or school maybe more border posts not just a giant fucking wall but yeah i agree our borders should be reinforced but a wall cmon
spanish sure pal
i would like to hear why you think it is a good idea to build the wall we could go back all the way in the family historylike at tge nazitimes and deport all illegal immigrantseven those who live in the states for generations who would stay left i can tell you native americans
this guy is a conspiracy nut im from new mexico and i will not be voting for him
so how do we control people coming in here illegallymake them pass through some checkpointso a borderno im against borders just do an xray gatethat is a border and checkpoints occur at a borderlet me get back to you via email
and this people is what were up against
im what u may call an anchor babyi work follow the law  pay taxes i say fuck it build the wall we dont need more people here especially in california
because ive been watching jordan peterson ill have to say that this guys free speech allows him to hash out his thoughts and develop them to get feedback on what is right and what is wrong with his thinking im talking about the last guy not sc while i dont agree with his ideas im glad he had an opportunity to speak them maybe hell watch this here and see some feedback in the comments
the guy he spoke to is literally in dreamland
god that fucking spaniard is the biggest idiot iv ever seen
thatguynsaying hes not mexican but spanish bullshit i am spanish thats a mestizo if i ever saw one if some family of his actually came from spain they sure had a lot of sex with the indios
i hope he becomes the governor soon
the spaniard from the 1500s new mexico should run for governor of an already failed santuary state it would be soooooooooooooo fun to watch he would surround himself with masterminds 
guys lets put up an xray gate  from go green global btw xrays shoot off radiation duh
im all for immigration into the us just legally i think the wall has ended being talked about as this derogatory symbolic thing of racism but if you come legally then the wall is irrelevant to you coming here because its not stopping you it is a deterent for illegal immigration which is considered criminal activity ok so what is the reason people just want to come illegally vs coming to the us legally why arent they taking the steps to be legal
have fun building a wall which will cost so fucking much and will take multiple decades to build well america is in debt and still wants to build a wall america is a fucking joke
wow i wish i could talk to this guy
lol the spanish guy tried so hard but he dug him self into a wally hole now he looks like a wally haha x ray machines
build the wall get some snipers on it n no more illegals
lol what if mexico just gets fucked off and closes the boarder after the wall gets built
naw dont build a wallbuild like an xray wall
that dude is retarded
your ancestors came here illegally they   killed raped and stole the land dont complain on illegally immigration when its nothin compared what your people did
were there really no intelligent people around the table or are these two morons the ones steven chose to feature
we need xray gates and sharks with frikin lazer beams
wooooowww listening to that guy was paaaaiiiiinful digital tags xray 
that guy is nutshes the future of this countrywe are going down the tubes fast
anyone else hear him say his family has lived in new mexico since 1550
i dont care if you support trump or not but building the wall is probably the dumbest idea ever lols there are so many ways they can get in that doesnt involve a wall lols its literally a waste of time and money your stupid if you think other wise
how would one install a gate without a wall to attach it to  even if its an xray gate how would it be free standing  why go through it if you can just walk around it  stupid peopleedit just watched crowders closing with that guy  stephen you evil genius you  xd  youre a comedic genius man  go think about your xray wall and ill have you on the show to talk about iti bet you fucking will  bwahahahahah
that guy in white is incapable of coherent thought change my mind
what a fucking idiot  so give them citizenship and thats going to magically change the proportion of crimes they commithey miguel lets go rob that foolaw man i cant  i just got a social security cardgive me a goddamn break  stupid stupid people
the white tshirt guy is very ambitious
id love to take the free market small government case for not building a wall and argue with you about it the wall would be a huge waste of my money that i dont want limiting the free movement of people and capital is bad by default the wall would be a severe misallocation of my resources and hindrance to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
yeah that 37 of homicides number really doesnt sound right lol anybody got a source
this guy is just trying to get views and likes for his own pageviewers
what would a wall change
someone has been watching to much jason bourne magical people will just be tagged as they cross open borders
pseudo intellect personified  1004
i dont want a wall either i like the xray idea or maybe a moat with sharks with laser beams on their heads
you need to blur and distort that womens voice a bit better it would suck of one of the illegals shes talking about comes across this
that guy should be a politiciansteven build the wall change my minddude  cars run on gas but some are electric or diesel steven how does that answer the question dude  questions can be taxed but shouldnt be askedsteveni think hes either a troll or high
foo like just put x ray border foo i seen that in the movies foo like fuck it
that guy is spanish lol no mames
warning proceed with caution in this comment and section
second guy basically i dont know anything but do this that will help thnx idontknowanything guy
the guy from spain is an absolute idiot  he is against the wall but all for implanting digital devices to track your movements  an unbelievable invasion of privacy  this guy is a complete fool  do another one of these with smarter people
if youre not educated on the subject dont open your mouth about it ignorant comments like deport them all is just funny like good luck to you if you really believe that you can kick out illegal immigrants in a country built on immigration its like people who believe in lets just ban all guns in the united states because of all these school shootings yeah no lol
most of the people i have talked to have no idea what its like to live in one of these boarder states and never see or hear what troubles come across the boarder we need the wall but we also need a faster and cheaper way for people to come her legally so people are not afraid and coyote runs end drugs in this country just make it legal end the cartel north and south boarder very much needed go to other countrys let me know where they dont check your passport papers and have there border checks and see if they dont arrest you why should we be any different
cocaine is a hell of a drug
i like his vans
berlin fuck head fuck it
there is no illegal immigration problem illegal immigration has been in decline if anything the immigration system is the real problem
the first guy xray border  identifying machine that tracks the illegal border crossers
walther shirt nice have one you rock
805 how about we annex mexico what do we as a people get out of letting people come here land and resources are finite at what point do we say enough is enough
i say a fence and electrifying it so it is harder to get in
when they say that everyone is an immigrant
all the conservative content creators have ads at the beginning that are anticonservative 
god is fakechange my mind
this kid is on meth white shirt
i feel like you had more interviewees and they ate you alive so when you made this video you posted the 2 dumbest people you interviewed and didnt show us the people who actually outsmarted you
walls are expensive use landmines there are many countries who would be happy to get rid of them walls around cities then fences then landmines for the more desolate areas but with drones and agents patroling regularly
you interviewed 2 people this was the dumbest change my mind youve produced yet and you never even stated your half of the argument why do you think the wall should be built especially when most of the illegal immigrants in this country came here legally
your statistics are misleadinghere is some information from the us sentencing commission in 2015manslaughter 96 percent us citizens murder 84 percent sexual abuse 95 percent robbery 98 percent drug trafficking 74 percent bribery 93 percent money laundering 76 percent racketeeringextortion 87 percent child pornography 96 percent and burglarybreaking and entering 100 percenti dont know what data you cherry picked to say that illegal immigrants commit 37 of homicides but its a disgusting misrepresentation that has no place in a productive conversation
xray border
and 100 of them are criminals in general by being in the country illegally
the wall is gonna cost us a shit ton of money
how much of the 35 commit the crimes  is it like 25 of the 35 commit crimes while only 12 of the 965 commit the crimeswhat are the proportions
my dad promised me hed come back from the store change my mind
how do you stay clam when you are trying to make a point crossword or when your argueany tips
wtf has this guy been smoking  
wow  these are so painful to watch sometimes  some of these folks who sit down are unintelligible
this guy is dumb as   change his brain lol
this is a really interesting topic but i wish you had smarter people to discuss this issue with these people clearly are not very knowledgable and are do not convey their thoughts well please do this one again in a different area
i love steven so much this is coming from san deigo california too
can you provide the source that says immigrants commit 37 of violent crimes ive been searching and cant find that anywhere
why the fuck did you go through the trouble of blurring the womans face but you didnt blur her id tag
steven where are you getting the statistic that 37 of homicides are committed by illegals i cant find that anywhere
how do you make money off of low skilled labor  the deficit they would add to the economy for social services and medical care alone would put the us in the red right off the bat  people coming from mostly mexico are coming here to exploit the social services this country offers  we arent getting mexicos doctors engineers and innovators were mostly getting lowno skilled labor
the flaw with the illegal immigrant statistic is that you cant account for the illegal immigrants that do not commit crimes as they are not registered in the united states
ur mum gey change meh mind
a giant x ray border wonderful
1316 steven pulled a jim halpert skskjs
steven crowder is not a comedian change my mind
all illegal immigrants are technically criminals  a criminal is anyone who breaks the law regardless of the level of legal offense entering the us illegally is a misdemeanor and makes you a criminal by definition when you talk about murders and drug trafficking that relates to felonies  the term criminal is often used to describe someone who has committed a terrible crime but really a felon is used to describe someone who has commuted more heinous crimes
i believe we should stop building walls and start building more bridges welcome people of every ethnic group and race
i think a cartoon should be made to show and explain why the wall needs to be built
jesus christ this guy is retarded
so he doesnt want a wallhe wants an xray wall
tax them has that not been tried i think i heard somewhere that someone tried that was it clinton bush i dont know someone if i remember right it failed because there was no way to find them if they cant be found after taking children theyre related to because they skip town with kid in tow how are we supposed to tax them or not knowing theyre there
i think youre full of shit saying your family has been here since 1550 change my mind
ladies and gentlemen the new governor of nm lol
what surprised me most is this ignorant unfunny racist guy called steven crowder has a youtube channel
stevens face at the end hes just like what the fck was that
im close minded change my mind
did anybody else want to call ice on that dudes camera cable
1128 good on you for saying that with a straight face
i support you fully stephen but i have zero desire to watch any of these change my minds i already know the and the usa especially is chock full of pretentious uninformed sjw douche bags and frankly it only frustrates megives me a headache to hear them babble
lol xray border
she had a better idea and point of view
doesnt most immigration form mexico come from planes
he tried to back track so badly wow
electronic id implants and xray scanners the fuck was that guy talking about
you dont have to build a wall as soon as they cash a check or buy something major like a car anywhere they need to be taxed and what not and monitor and making sure everyone follows the laws and not commit crimes that put the public in danger
i bet if trump proposed an xray scanning tracking and taxing system barrier along the entire border hed be a racist in this guys mind
lets see xray scanning and tracking system along the entire border with funnel checkpoints  seems like you just described essentially a wall security system
this guy is just as stupid as any other democrat pulling ideas out of his ass and using that as a basis for his argument none of these open borders idiots bother to do real research
report n deport all illegal immigrants trump 2020 
as someone with 3 advanced degrees i cannot even comprehend the ramblings of this utter moron in the white shirt  its frankly terrifying that this morons opinion and inability to put together a coherent thoughts is actually quite common  he wants everyone coming across to comply and be electronically xrayed tagged and tracked terrifying thought by itself and seems to acknowledge the need for checkpoints yet is against a wall or any other physical security and just thinks everyone will comply while acknowledging rampant crime and people will avoid compliance  he sees no slowing in the flood of people but is still against borders and thinks drugs brought in by immigrants is a small percent   um oookkkaaayyy
this boi has a single digit iq
it seems that many people have this idea that building a wall is going close our nation off from the rest of the world and vice versa  i have also heard people claim the wall will be ineffective as we hear many chime they will just find other ways to get in others  some of whom i know personally  claim the usa is and should be open to all those who wish to enter believing everyone is entitled to pursuing the american dream whether they come legally or not humans  one person in particular said  we are all humans not americans  not citizens of nations but humans  transhumanism he called it   the irony of his opinion lies in the fact that he has the bill of rights hanging in his living room but doesnt tolerate opinions that differ from his like i said in my earlier comment  many people are sorely misinformed  but unfortunately  many people are also totally brainwashed willing to believe what master tells them to believe so long as master says its hip  its trendy  hilariously  those i know who hold these views  well  they seem to think they are badass  woke  punk rockers going against the grain as they flock together in the name of antifascisism and freedom ironically attempting to shut down anything or anyone they dont agree with  lmao yeah  punk rock fucking ants  sheep robots  manchurian citizens cult members  zombies they are so far removed from reality that they have lost all and any appreciation for the natural born rights we  as humans have but  more importantly  we as americans have protected under our glorious constitution  this brings me back to the wall without walls  without borders  we cease to exist as a sovereign nation without our sovereignty  our constitution doesnt matter  without our constitution  our rights are no longer protected from those who seek to destroy everything america has become  what it means to the world  and what it means for the future of humanity  the greatest nation to have ever existed in known history needs walls to keep the greatness in  and the heathens out i believe people are seeing through the propaganda especially thanks to the internet which has been considerably free flowing since its public debut but the word is out the globalsit elites minions have been exposed bare for all those who wish to look to see without walls  we would end up seeing only what true evil wants us to see instead we have the freedom to see all we are able and make well informed decisions as the good men who founded our country intended us to do  thank god for our founding fathers and thank god we as a nation were able to lead donald trump to the white house this was the longest damned comment ive ever written so if you read it awesome i hope i didnt bore youthanks to all the crew working on louder with crowder i love the show  the guests  the parody films and the honest and open consideration for others opinions  i can always depend on you guys to make me laugh  god bless and keep it upbuildthewall maga godblessamerica louderwithcrowder notgayjared changemymind freespeech nationsneedborders protectourcitzensamericafirst
bringing up statistics over and over instead of giving an honest opinion is annoying
im really not involved into politics that much but i do believe there are other solutions than allowing anyone to enter the country illegally and completely rejecting to help the ones who are genuinely trying to better their lives but cant afford to immigrate legally if we helped these countries grow and root out corruption wed be reducing the amount of illegal immigrants entering and building stronger relationships with these nations i know its not our responsibility and that we have problems of our own but i can really empathize with those who reside in the country illegally while trying their best to make a living without hurting anyone maybe im completely wrong and everything i said wouldnt work but we should take a more positive approach to the situation regardless take my comment with a grain of salt im not trying to create any heated arguments or discussions
if you wanna end drugs trafficing problem just legalize all drugs
chinga tu madre wey
damn i wish people were in favor of civil and intelligent debate i wish people were smart
if you searched the entire planet for the smartest democrats and liberals and added up all their iqs you wouldnt come up with whole number
crowder how we solve the problemcamdude tax them make them make a course of some sortillegal yeahthats a no from me my dudebasically dont deport them force them to pay if they dont wanna pay cant deport them so force them to pay if they dont wanna pay cant deport them so force them to pay  will need assistance to fix the loopedit watched the full talk with the dude im sorry for trying to get logic with his toughts  he is an idiot
that spaniard speaks and looks like a mexican maybe his spaniard lineage cones from a conquistador raping his aztec great great great great great great grandma
come to the university of northern iowa please
xx is alive change my mind
lets open borders  and close social benefitschange my mind 
the wall cant stop planes
im not trying defend criminals but the percent of immigrants that commit crimes is due to the fact that most live in the ghetto its not the fact that your an immigrant problem is the hood that mostly includes latinos and black people most white people dont have financial struggles like the hood
i wonder if all these statistics hes saying are even true lol it looks like hes just saying random numbeds
hey you should do a   i am voting for trump to get reelected  change my mind or a   trumps gonna get reelected change my mind on a college campus
i have nothing other to say than scientifical a new word from an aspiring gentleman who says he seeks the seat of governor of new mexico amazing
what a fakesaying hes not latino but spanish
you do not have to have a debate about building the wall its just a straight up no it has already been proven the wall would not affect the rate of illegal immigrants all your other videos i could follow but this one nah terrible dont pick and choose your debates this video could have had atleast a dozen people telling you an easy and simple answer as to why not
well he has the potential to be the governor of new mexico
why does the fault always fall back on us  why arent we putting pressure on mexico to clean up there government  help there citizens rid of the drug cartels and the corrupt people in power  mexico is laughing in our face and so are the drug cartels  smh
this wont be on trending
oh no he wants to be the governor of my state one day i wish him well on his goals but i hope his ideas improve on this matter because he sounds silly
that guy is just talking in what ifs lmao
you should really think about hanging yourself from the highest tree
what a freaking mushhead it hurts my head listening to this guy
i fuck midgets eat shit
the wall is non binary we cant allow these migrant workers to reproduce democratic party officials to enslave northern ireland with their harlem traits stop and inherit white privilege its been working since jimmy carter was doing it
x ray gate but no border wow so he want a xray across the borderi want what this mans smoking because he was sweating and babbleing bad great job on the pulling stuff out your ass bub
i believe in stricter border policies but not the wall its just too much money and theyre gonna find a way to cross no matter what my immediate family illegally crossed the border but theyre citizens now
everyone making fun of the second guy but he may be on to something think about it everyone you know has a cellphone or some type of electronic device it wouldnt be that hard to have them tagged with something i know its not full proof but neither is a wall honestly maybe with both of them it might help
try this again at a different venue these people were dumb
if you support the wall your are in fact a complete idiot not saying anything about immigration the whole wall idea is the dumbest thing anyone has ever come up with
xray gate
37 of the homicides in the country commited by illegal immigrants just flatout wrong by a long shot just alittle research  needed to find the real nymbers
im a gay clone change my mind
second guy had no idea what he was talking about lol
liberals would still say no only time theyll be happy if u just say here america is open everyone can come in mo search no background search just come in u can be like all illegals are welcomed just have to pass the us citizen ship theyll still be pissed and mad
build the wall out of mexicans problem solved636 increase in illegals since 2017 its like a fuking piata exploded  build the wall maga
that fat lady is probably dead right now just blurring her face not even distorting her voice or blurring the picture on her card everyone that knows her in real life knows that thats her
well theres a reason why theyre called illegal immigrants i do think however that there should be a criminal record check as well as like a 3 month time not concluded to get a job foundation where immigrants can live in like a public community while trying to get money and not pay taxes of course after they will become independent and will need to start paying taxes and just like any other us citizen i think they will have to pay taxes even when going outside of the country however not yet us citizens
it seems most people are just sorely misinformed those willing to sit down and have a conversation are just waiting  urning  subconsciously craving a red pill awakening the mainstream media has become such a ghastly diservice to this nations citizens and its time to officially discredit and comtinue to boycott media outlets and other organizations that participate in antitrump antiamerican propaganda
if any of those illegal immigrants know that lady you were talking to first theyd be able to recognize her i hope she doesnt get terrorized because of this
please crowder i know whats worked in the past and that can work know if you perfect from the past with out making the wall bigger
hell make a great governor
a wall would disrupt wildlife territories thats basically the biggest reason i can see not to build it people can work to change their situation but the animals have no control
simple solution if the wall cant stop them make not having a work  visa or a ssn federal pay maximumminimum 25ctshr for jobs no one wants like roadside cleaning hell get them doing the worse possible work idk anyone willing to shovel shit out of a backed cesspool for 25ctshr hell coastal reclamation work send any of undocumenteds that have kids in america as anchor babies back to their origins country with the child if you want illegals to stop coming the cheap way to the american dream turn the illegal route into a nightmare
im a muslim and ive been watching you for about a year i have to say that i agree with 99 of what you say not all muslims hate you look at the end of the description
i dont support the wall for a couple reasons1 why not just use the billions of dollars it will take to help veterans who struggle or give money to people who actually need it2 pay off the debt first and use money we already have that we save to build wall if we need it that bad3 the wall would help but i dont think it should be a top priority
gotta say as a first gen mexican american  that dude was stooooooooooooooooooooopid
i just saw an advertisement for your channel leading into your video well done sir
this hispanic guy is fucking braindead
kinda new to these but im getting addicted as someone who is firmly in the atheist community would you ever consider doing a religion based change my mind forgive me if this is only politics based but i love hearing varying opinions thanks
redo this change my mind episode
that guy was obviously lit kind of a waste of time
why are some of these people allowed to walk around unsupervised this guy is out there
way to scientifical for me
that dude really said xray border
steven seems so bored  wonder why
just deport everyone not white problem solved
13 reasons why thanos had it right change my mind
i just dont think that the wall would be effective right now because a large majority of the illegal immigrants living in the united states right now came came legally by plane with their work visas and simply overstayed their visits there are obviously some illegal immigrants trying to cross the physical border but with so much focus on the issue right now the borders are so tight that its very unlikely theyre going to get through right now anyway actually building the wall sounds like a dream where we would have no financial issues coming after that and starting that project now wouldnt be too wise considering our president doesnt have unlimited time in office im not crazy liberal or anything but this idea still seems ridiculous
this guy is why we need a wall
the guy starting at 410 is pretty slow
earth is flat yo
this dude saying his goal is to be governor maybe it should have been passing highschool
httptimecom4473972donaldtrumpmexicomeetinginsult theyre bringing drugs
the part that surprised me the most was do a change my mind segment on climate change with potholer54 coward
he says hes going to be governor of new mexico some day lmaoooo oh wait our president is donald trump new mexicans dip out while you still can
illegal immigrants commit more crimes because statistics is that really cause and effect though pretty sure poverty goes hand in hand with crime and these immigrants arent living in the best areas and arent born into a lot of money so lets build a wall around all cities with increased higher percentage of crime lol its hard to argue this wall because its just a moral issue and why do you want to kick illegal immigrants out so bad because some of them sell drugs you wanna kick out all the undocumented hard workers that work for bottom dollar at jobs nobody else wants to work at okay thats not gonna solve drugs or crime ill tell u that much lol
this proposed xray scanner and chipping every human before they cross the border either way would cost way more than the damn wall which would cost too much itself
please do part 2 of this but find an intelligent individual to talk to haha thanks
steven crowder is a hack change my mind
this particular episode was a real let down i believe the wall may be the easiest of crowders hot topics to argue against but these people were not articulate or educated enough to defend against crowders stats and debate prowess
the guy with a camera is a moron everything he says is true because hes been talking to a lot of people and whoever watches his show needs to wake tf up
people clapped because that guy finally stopped talking and he wants to run for mayor of nmc how can someone be such an imbecile
is solo soylochange my mind
we need the wall enforced with land mines and turrets illegals dont get a say in what america does with its borders
he will need to brush up on his english before he becomes governor of new mexico change my mind
10 feet 20 feet 100 feet tall
i know a free flowing style thing its called ar15 bammmmm
second guy has no idea what hes talking about
i did some research here and this study actually shows that illegal aliens actually commit less crime than most african american and caucasian communities under the poverty line in fact most communities that see an uprise in foreignborn people actually see an increase in stability as opposed to areas that see an increase in the number of african american populace interesting study and im sure its not the only one but id like to know where steven got the source for the statistics hes talking about at 650 heres where i collected my information httpcriminologyoxfordrecomview101093acrefore97801902640790010001acrefore9780190264079e93as for my opinion about whether or not there should be a wall to stop illegal immigrants from entering the country im honestly not really sure i dont know how well a giant brick wall would demotivate people from trying to get into the countryedit thank you guys for taking the time to reply if anyones getting angry or thinks im taking a side im not i love stevens videos and im simply asking questions thank you for those of you that replied with legitimate critiques of the article and my statements and to the user im unsubscribing who said faggot youre a faggot too 
ok now steven is getting idiotic build a wall thats the best way to stop illegal immigration
there were no other conversations
either that guy is super dumb or super high
im sorry new mexico your next governor seems fuckd
wow except for the first lady what idiots
that guy wants everyone to get the globalist devil mark of the best computer chip in their right hand
wow after listening to the second guy i feel a little dumber
you only ever have people of minor education or little political knowledge to debate anyone can win those debates
82 of all wealth generated last year was directly sent into the pockets of the worlds richest 1 httpswwwoxfamamericaorgexploreresearchpublicationsrewardworknotwealthit isnt the illegals that are causing your economic anxiety brother giving drink to the thirsty should never be an offense of any sort the world has moved past such barbaric actions through lessons learned from the trail of tears the nazis aparthaid the american civil rights movement etc im sorry but you are incredibly naive if you think any illegal immigrant has harmed you in any way everhonestly a good percentage of those aliens work and can never collect on the social security unemployment or pretty much any program so as a result these people fund our programs and never collect giving natural born americans a surplus the factories moved to mexico the mexicans didnt move into the factory no one took anyones job at least in any statistically significant number i should state i am unaware as to the state of the migrant farmer labor pool among 39 year old white males but i doubt it is bursting at the seams so to speak the jobs were simply moved away or automated i bet anyone who thinks they lost their factory job to a mexican actually lost it to a robot and the mexican is just there to sweep the dustthe drugs dont come in on border crossers either you can get far more just through the post with less witnesses often traffickers will ship heavy work trucks or front loaders basically any equipment stuff the gas tank full of drugs and take some metal off to make the weight check out normally and just ship the truck why strap 50lbs of dope to some poor immigrant who could go anywhere and use any name and instantly make a couple years salary when you can ship your buddy a caterpillar dump truck with 500kilos in it also you can get smaller amounts through customs fairly easily just in an envelope the drugs should be legal anyway and trust me theres a few thousand characters coming your way after this post showing whywhat else do yall say about undocumented persons crime they commit far less crime than timmy or susie down the road statistically one fifth actually to be specific we could probably get this number lower if the aliens here could call the police on the criminals amongst them without fear of deportation thats a part i dont think you really get if theyre in their neighborhood and see a mugging and they call 911 they might end up on the same bus back as the criminal and all his buddies back home are just waiting to kill them is that just does that please you if it means your imaginary line was abided by you might argue they commit less crime because we kick them out or other ridiculous nonsense but they actually thought of that and looked at the specific causes and because cnn and nyt are fake news heres the direct study httpwwwnberorgpapersw13229pdf youll want to read the abstract just in case you werent familiar with academic articles something tells me you lot dont read too many of them its actually because the groups that self select to make the difficult and arduous journey are actually the same kind of folks who believe in working hard to better your life through blood sweat and tears so their kids can have it easier than they did sounds pretty god damn american to meall recreational drugs should be legal we need to end the ban of all recreational drugs there are numerous reasons for the legalization of all drugs im in the northeast usa i see the opioid epidemic first hand and overdoses would be much rarer in a legal regime as they are primarily a result of fentanyl being used as a cut or much more rarely dealers setting up a hot bag designed to cause an od to show the comparative strength of their product compared to competitors prohibition of any substance is bound to fail as it completely ignores human nature furthermore the vast majority of negative effects of heroin meth or other hard drugs are actually a result of the illegal black market and wouldnt be present in a legal regime not to argue theyre harmless certainly not but you simply cannot write off the overwhelming amount of downsides solely resulting from the legal situationthe war on drugs serves no purpose other than giving police carte blanche justification to violate americans fourth amendment rights searching vehicles because they smell weed stopandfrisk etc ignores the rights of many in the developing world fails to stem the supply of any drug stigmatizes people simply for preferring substances other than booze which is actually more harmful than any other recreational drug source httpwwwthelancetcomjournalslancetarticlepiis0140673610614626abstract funds illegal gangs cartels and terrorist organizations and creates an enviroment where both users and law enforcement are at an immesurably greater risk of injury or death no knock raids put police and citizens at great risk for little reason usually in the name of the war on drugs when distribution is in the hands of criminals they are likely to maximise their profit margins by enhancing their product with fentanyl as its cheap and 50 times stronger than heroin to illustrate its affordability i was once given a free 100mg sample of pure fentanyl hcl all it cost was postal charges this is the primary cause of the overdose epidemic gripping america httpswwwtherecordcomnewsstory7316428fentanylfoundin80percentofstreetdrugstestedinbcstudyin a legal regime the government could produce drugs sell them at cost through state drug stores ensuring adults only have access and that they are sold things in proper dosage increments and standardized purity with sterile safe paraphernalia to prevent transmission of diseases and damage from old or dirty gear the tax revenue could fund responsible use drug education and allow treatment centers to be better equipped and more effective this would also help reduce the stigma of both drug use and abuse with abuse being treated similarly to alcohol abuse is harm reduction measures such as reagent testing injection and use sites etc would further alleviate problems arising from use as well it is against the value of liberty to prohibit recreational substances from consenting adults and gives police justification for their militarization thats been going on the past few decadessmall town law enforcement does not need apcs and other specialized military and intelligence hardware it only reinforces societal distrust nor does every single cop need a weapon on them at all times they should at the very least have extra training or certification in advanced deescalation tactics or only have them in their car to respond to lethal threats and lethal threats only to lead to them exploring more avenues for deescalation prior to even considering deadly force also prices of drugs would be drastically lower in a legal market allowing users to partake without breaking the bank financially further reducing property crime associated with addictionsin conclusion the war on drugs is the single greatest injustice to happen today and it even fails to deliver results heroin meth or crack will never be completely eradicated no drug will be prohibition just harms users and causes a plethora of problems also to clarify some substances ie carfentanil are too potent to not be considered chemical weapons and should still be regulated as such until the police unilaterally end enforcement of drug laws i consider them an enemy of the people and an oppressive force designed to keep the working class down at the behest of the monied elite
did he say latins
no border  no country
20 of federal inmate population is illegals
yawn someone get me whatever the backpack guy is on lol
well it is common knowledge that the average american is not very bright and its been proven again
an xray borderfacepalm
i had to laugh at the spanish man he ought to sue and file charges against whoever took his brain cells
when he started talking about the xray scanner autoidentifier i lost my shitbless you for this gem of a video
yep an x ray border where we eradicate with eradication
just invade the world and make one big country 
bahaaacrowder was that the best of the worst love the potential governer of new mexico bahaagosh it could happen in this day and age lolll
crowder has blown up
were 21 trillion dollars in debt
i gotta give the guy credit for trying lol
steven i wear checkered vans crowder
has anybody linked to the last guys video i would be interested as to his take away
gotta disagree with steven on this one the wall wont stop anything people in favor of the wall are in favor of any solution that trump throws at them they have this fear instilled upon them that people from south of the border are going to rape their wives and kidnap their children when in reality theres plenty of people born in this country already doing that and worse the fact of the matter is the majority of the people coming across that border illegally are coming to look for better economic opportunities that arent available in their country and do not have the resources available to apply for legal entry into the us even if a wall were to be built there will still be people coming across it it is a terrible waste of money that can be used for better purposes if people feel they have a need to come into this country they will do it where there is a will theres a way regardless if theres a wall or not
do this again please
my arguement is simple its a waste of money to build the wall the wall wont fix the drug trafficking issue and there are other ways to get in here illegaly it would be better and cheaper to expand the border patrol and give them adequate funding also fuck donald trump
these retards make me want to have the wall built so that i  can throw them out of the us and never let them back in
oh great hes thinking of being the next governor of new mexico  on second thought might be an improvement  we should get a few mastermind individuals to think this over
its hard to watch this
your family was in new mexico since the 1550s we didnt even have america then
the wall wont work simply because it will increase the number of illegal immigrants in the united states it will be harder to get into the country therefore it will be harder to get out and once they get in they wont want to take the trouble to go back to mexico so theyll settle down in the us when border control was strengthened in the past it increased the number of illegal immigrants in america also 13 of illegal immigrants come in by plane anyway and a wall cant stop that
no wall but an xray border reminds me of some people i know
christ crowder can you bring someone thats not a complete mongrel into these im sure these cant be the best debaters you encounter while youre out there right
leroy for governor lets have a huge xray gate which will span the entirety of the usmexico border thats what xrays are for and im sure itll cost less than a wall that man is a genius
i do believe there has to be border control but the wall wont stop any1 they will just climb over it ad the wall is very expensive and it would just be a huge waste although they need stronger border defenses that will be affective and not as expensive as a wall that is not very effective and mexico is not buying the wall heheh
umwhat  and he was so sincereaww
i agree with a lot of your views but isnt the stchick of this show is that nothing is edited  feel like you did it heavily with the first woman  kind of kills your credibility  also i realize i edited my comment lol 
if your family has been in mexico since 1500s  your mexicanchange my mind
the us government is only letting the illegals stay and not crack down on them as much because they use them for cheap labor
this guy said he wanted to be the governor of new mexico lol this dude needs to hit the books the way he talked and brought up his points were cringe worthy
give it up for the future governor of new mexico 
fuck the wall  trump
im a supporter of an xray border change my mind
that mexican is a dumb fuck hahaha
this change my mind did not stimulate my mind like the other ones did like people are saying do it again and lets hope for intelligent people next time
hey steven hopefully you read this although i disagree with some of your beliefs and standpoints i think what you do is important i have liberal and conservative friends and i think that if either one cant have an open and educated discussion about their points that they run the risk of being bias and ignorant its so essential to challenge peoples views and our own to maintain a level of evolution your talk on hate speech was great as a black person ive been spat at jumped called a nigger and denied service but i would never put myself in a position where i would want to pretend that this doesnt exist when you ban someones way of thinking you not only violate their rights but you also take away any chance you have of changing their opinion the world cant be a place where anything that offends you should be tucked away so from a modern day socialism believing advocate of not raising the minimum wage in canada to 15hr supporter of different gender roles nonsupporter of making people accept your gender role because you said so or calling it an act of violence and supporter of gun control thank you for challenging my opinion and thr opinion of many others its critical thinking that changes the world and you sir are encouraging people to do so
i dont want to knock the guy down too much so i will just say this bravo to him for having the courage to debate and not result to name calling liberals i also want to point out that steven cool name by the way should have given him a bit more of your side of why his point fails so miserably i mean he was trying to avoid the wall situation so much that he was constantly checking his verbiage as to not speak that word wall and eventually couldnt contain himself in the end and gave up the word gate at least i enjoyed the xray idea as well as how he kept giving his argument that eventually leads to us needing a wall to funnel those in who need to get to this xray machine i hope he comes on your show steven and informs you that he completely changed his mind and wants to keep america great again 
this is the type of retard i want no coming here
wtf was that last guy
dude watches too many movies arguments were weak come to sacramento and surrounding areas
im not against the idea of better policies or even increased patrol for border control  that main reason i would even be against a wall would be the disruption of seasonal migration with the local wildlife  thats my beef with it
no human is illegal on stolen land 
i understand where the second guy is coming from and it sounds crazy just hearing him speak yet he might not be too far off from predicting how things may go in the future i dont think borders will be opened like 5 years from now but border rules have been getting weaker since their creation they are probably the weakest theyve ever been with the inclusion of sanctuary states and such the xray gate sounds strange but i think i understand what he means is like something that could tell what kind of person they are and what their reason for being in the us is kinda like a lie detector or something thats what i think at least it sounds quite scifi from what we have now yet it could be our reality that well have smart gates that can tell an immigrants motives for going into a country sometimes the smartest ideas are the ones that sound the craziest
leroy has a good heart but terrible ideas he couldnt comprehend the fact that illegals dont want to go through whatever he is proposing and creating a better flow system for illegal immigrants is equally as stupid leroy please please dont run for mayor
80 of illegals come by plane
the natives did not get a wall so neither do u
theres a lot of people that dont get caught so you cant out them in the statics theres alot of politicians law enforcement
that look at the end hahahaha he just wasted his time talking to one of the dumbest individuals ive ever heard speak
i stopped watching at electronic id tag
cant believe theres this level of stupid out there build a wall for what a metaphor its not going to stop anything fiscal conservatives so stupid they fail at both parts lmao
an xray gateaaaa
how can i deport white immigrants
crowder come to denver
 scientifical
haha steven i think you finally reached the end of the crazy train that is liberalism its like coming to the end of the internet or reaching light speed or reaching infinity nobody knows what happens there maybe the laws of physics break down and nothing makes any sense
wall is an impractical mean of immigration control
love your vids but no pls no
trolling
that guy in the white shirt is an idiot
you cant change my mind change my mind
homosexuality is gay change my mind
lol stick to universities maybe less nutjobs there
you interviewed idiots try the same topic in a different area
retarded
all these people for no boarder  no wall still have locks on their doors why
my family has been in new mexico since the 1550s 
the world cup sucks  change my mind
deport every single one
snitches get stitches change my mind 
next episode its ok to be white change my mind
dont do drugs kidsaaaaaaaaaand this is the type of people we dont want here lol
that dude is an idiot he will never be governor
lmao this guys logic make them citizen tax them wtf
holy shit the guy at 1005 is such a fucking idiot i cant sit and listen to him talk
i really dont care do u
we need a wall dumb mexican make mexican americans hispanics like myself look stupid
dig under the wall go through the wall  over the wall or around the wall
they should do this again and find someone with better arguments one of the main reason why i the wall would be kind of useless is because most people who are here illegally came here by plane most people come and just over stay their visas and stay here illigaly im pro deportation but we should focus more on the real criminals aand maybe give people that have lived here for many years and have made contributions and pay their taxes a chance of maybe become a legal resident theres always group of people that gives a bad reputation to the rest of the group also most of the illegal people work for a living and pay taxes but cant use any of the benefits no free health care or any type of help from the government so actually the only ones who benefits from their work its the rest of the nation just my opinion
whats worse a liberal or a canadian acting american  honest question
that closing shot
why talk to retarded people when you can get actual policy experts on your show could it be youre afraid of what theyll say
how can that guy simultaneously believe in no borders or countries yet he wants undocumented people to go through an xray border   into the non country   to be taxed through some kind of not checkpoint   very confused individual
not your best change my mind only two people and neither were what i would charitably call up to the taskat least the college kids had somewhat coherent points even if they were just regurgitating what they learned at indoctrination camp  the anti wall argument i hear most  is trump is just a racist there really isnt much depth to any of the arguments ive heard against positive border control none could explain the incongruity when asked why they lock their own doors when theyre not  home
coke is better than pepsi change my mind
sweet idiot
i am a conservative but crowder was statistically wrong when he talked about illegal immigrants and committing crimes other than illegally crossing the border
nothing like a smart dumb nigga 
i could feel my brain cells committing suicide every time that kid opened his mouth
500  what the hell are lahins
bless the first womanbreaks my heart but she is right the criminals will find a way the good people fleeing a war anyone who has seen a combat situation will confirm mexico is a war zone could work out the wall would cost the tax payers too much proper intellegence for agencies to fight these dirt bags may help proper personal levels at the borders may help if the mexican government would get off their asses and ask for military help from all of us me canadian eh ha the garbage down there may calm and yes strengthen the irs to tax folks is a good plan but they would need other better agencies helpsolid discussions crowder people
you should move the banner to a college campus or near one had a lot of potential but was soiled by unintelligent people unable to hold a logical conversation
of course you wear a walther shirtwhy wouldnt you mrcrowder
building the wall is a fucking waste of money its a piece of faux reflexive nationalist symbolism that would only lead to more covert means of illegal immigration lets put more national guard etc on the border border patrol stop splitting up families stick to strong credentials for asylum and at least deport people as families instead of splitting them up and criminalizing them out right this president thinks we have billions of dollars to spend and a bunch of capital to spend on a fucking wall yet our infrastructure is d schools are under funded healthcare is shit but sure build a fucking wall end the drug war which has done nothing as well
940 is why marijuana should not be legal
got the add for there are 2 genders 2nd edition on this video i came from that one to this one
talk your immigration policy all you want the wall is objectively stupid cost and feasibility alone kill it in the crib
do you like short shorts steven likes short shorts
in all seriousness how would this wall be build like thats a lot of fuckin timber
if that guy ever becomes the governor of new mexico im striking that off my list of places to visitfor someone like me who has been straight edge my entire life its so obvious when someone is under the influence of obsession narcotics or some combination that guy exhibits several symptoms of dependency
seems like he is watching too much cartoons  all he can say is  i dont know  know the facts dude and stop watching too much cartoons
its amazing how moronically unrealistic some people are
so many decent arguments against a wall and what does he get some guy  with an xray gate so painfull
nobody ever thinks of maintenance of the wall reason being is look at how much of our infrastructure is crumbling
a wall isnt going to stop illegal immigration i am from a borderline city and a lot of people in my city have a visa or a passport people come and go to the usa a more down to earth solution would be more legal access for people to cross the border in my city the line to go into the states was about 2 hours so mexican people are going legally to the states every single day the vast majority of immigrants are working because the economy in mxico isnt the best the us dollar is almost the double that five years agothat percentage of immigrants committing crimes isnt going to stop unless your and ours justice sistem gets better anyone in their community can pinpoint the criminals but are afraid to acuse them because they are illegal too you are a legal immigrant from canada you come from a first world country most of  people that goes to work from third world countries dont have enough credentials to go for work but they do the jobs that most us citizens dont want to dohousekeeping gardening agriculture you know ask anybody if the want a job from 5 to 17 for a minimum wage salarywe take those jobs because the dollar is a more stable currency than the mexican peso i am a high school teacher and even a work at mcdonalds pays more than the amount of money i can do in mxico work visas and punishment for criminals is the solution but as long the illegal immigrants are considered as criminals the real criminals will still hide behind the fear of others
ok that mexican guy is crazy funny but crazy
shes a idiot
i love it you know i havent every really thought about it but heres my opinion and what i would dothanks for the enlightenment
all illegal border jumpers are criminals change my mind  that wannabe dem governor is a idiot
omg that free thought guy is fucking insane hahahasome kind of digital tag or chip  whatlike dogs  and a nationspanning xray scanner hahahathis guys never had a real job in his life has he  hes so far out in space that hes never had anything to keep him grounded xx
leroy was so nervous i would be too but i give him mad props for standing up for the hispanic community and what he believes in
the boy at the end was on one 
these people are completely brainwashed by the political poison spewed by the lying media they dont have a clue what is really going on total bs being shoveled down their throat and they ask please sir may i have another  so pathetic
he was thinking about an xray scanning border for 3 years
the mexicanamerican male at the beginning asked what percent of illegal immigrants do you think are criminals i would instantly say 100 as they broke laws which is what a criminal is is someone who doesnt follow laws obviously an illegal immigrant has broken immigration laws by coming here illegally
this idiot wants to stick tags on people from another country just incase they walk into usa jesus christ the left are beyond retarded
336 cringe
his look at the ends says it all hahaha
literally every idea these morons came up with would require a wall firstlets tex them   yeah  how  if there was no line at the movies people would just waltz in and sit down  why does no one understand thisfurthermore illegals have a tough time as it is coming into this country and working the shittiest jobsmany of them are standing in the parking lot of home depot right now waiting for their next gigyou want to tax those people  they didnt come here illegally to pay taxes idiotthats like sneaking into a theatre so you can pay laterthey didnt sneak in so that they can pay
the second dude literally described a wall with some sifi stuff while saying that he didnt like the wall idea i dont think we should build a wall either but this mans reasoning is crazy
racist asshole 
if you can build a wall to keep only the drug transporters and ppl with a criminal background than yes build that wall i have no problem with others coming over here to better their lives also ppl come here illegally because its literally impossible for these ppl from rural towns why would anyone pay thousands of dollars to put their lives in danger to come over when you can just file papers now you want to fix the drug problem here by building a wall try fixing it from the inside a drug user will get their drugs one way or another finally i dont have a problem with border security but spending billions on top of the billions we spend on homeland security to build a wall that will not live up to its price is another problem trump will get  in his pocket out of this deal just like his shady deals everywhere
why are people so stupid im scared that the first lady is even allowed to vote lol she literally is carrying around a plant in a soda bottle think about that
why would we spend so much money on a wall when we could spend it hiring border patrol and ice officers we could spend this money deporting illegal aliens who commit crimes while leaving those who work pay taxes stay off of welfare and dont commit crimes
 steven crowder 
so no borders but people will have to check in via xray gates when coming into the country sounds pretty much like a border just with crazy xray machines
what a fuckin totalitarian moronxray gatehahahahahahaaa
his vote is worth the same as yours and thats why communists globalists dont want the wall so more of these people can vote to take away your rights
whoathis dude is lostor has bad englishim not which or if its both
the second person the man although he was rambling and sometimes sounded like he had no clue actually had a good point technology is only accelerating and i dont believe a wall is feasible for border security  what is we tried to think of another approach that did track people coming into the country somehow lets consider all possibilities because in 2018 or 2025 a wall just seems so archaic
xxxtentacions death isnt sad change my mind
taxation is theft
who is this guy he dont know what the hell his talking about
does this dude not realize how expensive an electronic border would be god what an idiot and hes trying to become the governor of new mexico please
the 2nd dudemakes me wonder if any of the drugs he was supposed to smuggle made it across the border 
love the shirt
building a wall isnt a problem if you arent here illegally or dont plan to come here illegally then its fine
no one gives a shit about the wall i guess i dont think it will work if people wanna cross the border they will find a way
shouldve altered that womans voice too
deport all liberals problem solved
x is dead change my mind
i feel so sorry for that mexican american woman who went through the process of legal immigration only to live around a bunch of illegal criminals shell know the wall was a good choice in the end
build the wall
build a huge wall anyone caught climbing it should be shot on sight if you want to enter this country do it legally why is that so hard to understand
why dont you debate someone besides the uninformed my guess is that even a slightly educated interlocutor would shut you down grow up
the wall would cost a lot and theyd just build over it or dig under it or even get a boat or plane to quote jurassic park immigrants find a way
that idiot made my head hurt  governor  i wouldnt hire him to wipe my butt
i think he might have got trolled lol
dude those crime statistics would mean i would have to be surrounded by a lot of crimes bc i myself was illegal at one point and surrounded by a lot of illegal communities but never saw crime at that rate
any wall thats big enough to keep them out will be big enough to keep us in
build the wall u        h     ai          e     ll                ld
they should go through an xray gate in the wall we dont build
build a multi trillion dollar wall but dont assist students with education people against free edu act like every studies scissoring for feminists which is probably not true
this guy is so dumb that he has to be an actor trying to sound dumb please tell me he is
1030 the guy and his idea just reminds me of the film idiocracy probs where he got the idea from lol
has anyone got the reference for 37 of homicides
youre pretty narrow minded on this one crowderi think its pretty easy build the xray border have it where it scans for illegal substances and dissolves the drugs like some sort of star wars force field would if detected itll also brand them immediately with a tracker so that they can be deported if need be i think tony stark has some good things going with nanotechnology id talk to him first walls are a thing of the past my friend lets hope the illegal immigrants dont figure out teleportation
the hell i got a add from your last crap change my mind before this video
leeroy is not a spaniard change my mind
the real solution to masses amount of people coming in here illegally is not to build a wall but to stop giving them want they want for example jobs houses schooling health care etc and to start penalizing people who do that way they would see no point in coming in here illegally because they wouldnt having anything to gain from it
if that man ever becomes governor of new mexico itll be the nail in the coffin for democracy
she dont know what she want dont speak to women
cant wait to see the new governor of new mexico
dont build a wall for ecological reasons
i was a little surprised by the amount of ignorance in those who oppose the wall  just proves the amount of misinformation out there and how lazy people are when it comes to learning the facts
weekly shake up
these people are really dumn holy ahit
im in a debate with a moron who wants references to your stats can someone send me the link to the stats
i applaud stevens patients
if that first guy isnt on adderall ill jump off a bridge
what about overstayed visas
wont illegal immigrants just climb the wall or dig under it cause a big waste of money  change my mind
i think i lost a few brain cells listening to that last guy
what an idiot that spanish guy is
ok well the latino young man that sat down to discuss the wall definitely isnt doing anything to make his nationality look good i feel embarassed for him either he is stoned or just really iq challenged
lmao x ray border is that what that guy said smh his idiot send him back deport him we dont need retards and i love mexican and spanish people
that last guy left me speechless the ignorance is jawdropping
well with the xray border heres the problem a cartel drug mule writes im here to see my papi drives through and makes their runs tafuckingdah no police resistance
report them to ice god bless you crowder
i love that last guy that technically if he wanted to admit it or not argued for  a wall secure border 
a wall is pointlesssome of they come legally for holiday driving across the boarder or flying then stay there and disappearthe wall would stop a very small percentage that small percentage just use the thousands of tunnels that the government cant keep up with to walk under the wall its nothing more than a waste of tax payers money
cant get a idiot who you beat in the change my mind segment is that why its so short i understand when you are so stupid and so wrong its hard to find people you are smarter then
why are we listening to retards
do weight gain is a choice change my mind
that what the hell just happened look at the end lol
well here is a good question cus i don t see a lot of canadians crossing the border illegally why do many mexicans specifically not just illegal immagrants cus i knowa several from other countries want to enter america in the first place it seems that many of them love thier heritage and still speak spanish so why the only conclusion i can think of is that  mexico is making things so bad that they want to leave hence wouldnt solving the drug lord etc issues mexico help us more than building a wall cus it seems that thats the real issues here
he went from no borders whatsoever to lets take down what wall or fence we have and put an xray wall  literally still a god damn wall just an x ray wall  i swear the intelligence level in this country man
isnt ironic that they can come here and work without paying taxes but if an american tries to buy land in mexico it is forbidden
mexico is all for building the wall just not with mexican funds go ahead and do it yourself on us soil
a wall isnt going to improve the illegal immigration problem the country just needs stronger immigration regulations and contrary to what liberals believe enforce such regulations as a hispanic i feel bad for other hispanics who get deported but at the same time they knew the consequences and it somewhat devalues the reputation of legal immigrants
so we should make illegal immigrants take the test and then pay extra taxes but right now they are skipping the test when the extra taxes isnt even a thing so how are extra taxes going to make them want to come legally
why im against the walla wall bordering mexico would cost us so much money that could be used in something else like education or our infrastructure     building the wall would mean building over several mountain ranges for several hundred miles  which would still be a huge project if the wall was ten feet tall and three feet thick from some places  i heard that it would be more like 40 feet tall and much more thick i also say us because its seems more than far fetched to think that mexico would pay for it we dont need a wall  we need to better our way of handling these immigrants i wouldnt know where to begin with that  but maybe putting more people into the border patrol or improving the measures they take could be a start
sometimes you are right and sometimes you are wrong crowder you are wrong here to stop illegal immigration we need to1 end the war on drugs2 end the welfare lure3 hold people who hire illegal immigrants accountable and prosecute those who hire them including big ad textile industries and many others well never do that because they have too much influence on our politicians4 end the endless wars in the middle east and our military adventurism stirring up enemies
building a wall is easier than stealing your shit back that includes land cars and food so pretty much universal statement there
of course the wall will work thats why democrats are so opposed to it they want to keep the flow of illegals coming and having anchorsbabies who are by law american citizens who grow up and vote democrat
hahahaha   1315     this look  hahaha  it says wow how do we have such uneducated morons here    oh i get it now public education
is this really about building the physical wall isnt it supposed to be like the most expensive infrastructure project in history dont most illegal aliens come legally on a work visa
dudes been watching way too many sci fi movies
fucking idiots xray scanner this isnt bladerunner
leroy for president
illegal aliens take more out of the system than they put in this is enough reason not to allow them into the usa
sure the footage in this video is unedited but there has to be more discussions with knoledgable individuals that are not included in the various videos you release its a given that your perspective is going to look like the right one if you only include the videos that feature people who are not the most knowledgable
a disgrace to spain
i love you crowder nohomo
its amazing how we have created an environment where the most stupid of us can be deluded into thinking that they arent actually stupid and instead are intelligent enough to voice their opinion to potentially hundreds of thousands of people online it is the bane of our existence these days this poison that is accepted stupidity
ok the dude with the backpack is an absolute moron
if borders are nonexistent then what purpose does citizenship serve there is no point at all to being a citizen in a noncountry
leroy for governor
i still get surprised how fucking stupid people are its actually scary
i just want a place for people to come through the border that is regulated so they check their ids and get an explanation for why they are coming over so you mean you want a wall no it doesnt have to be a wall it can be an xray border do you know how big our borders are how do you get someone to walk through a doorway that scans you and asks you questions when there is nothing around the door to stop them from walking by
im so confused both of them were against the actual wall l but agreed with everything it represents they want something different that will accomplish the same thing  so a wall is bad why
liberalism is a mental disorder
mad props to crowder for sitting there with a straight face and not telling him what an idiot he is
you blur her face but not her id tag you should fix that brother
more evidence that people have no clue what we stand for as constitutional americans
fuck this channel i knew this dumbass was one of those under cover racist trump supporters
so this guy is suggesting putting rfid chips into everybody
you cut him off when he started to speak the truth about where the real drug threat comes from and only pay attention to his x ray idea funny part is that yall support a stupid ass wall because the orange orangutan said it but cant imagine his x ray idea ever working even though he said it was a free thought as in not been fully thought through yet you know like an idea dipshits  better then most on here just going along instead of coming up with ideas yourselves
a wall of xrays from texas to california sounds expensive
the governor of new mexico has left the building
this guy is nothing but a troll
how did you keep a straight face and stay so composed lmao im dying
the end of the video with claps this should go to pew die pie cringe moments ahahahahha
how do we know is not getting to the us trhough pacific ocean or atlantic and even canada border we know what we are told and repet it
alright crowder you should read this the wall should not be built whatsoever the fact of the matter is just as gun restriction laws are somewhat ineffective wether you can get a gun legally or cant chances are with the time and motive you will get a gun same thing with immigration there are many other methods to crossing borders illegally one of the major ones being cross the border legally with a temporary visa or something similar and simply overstay your time a major percent of these illegal immigrants simply use this tactic according to nbc news which cited a report made in 2014 42 of illegal immigrants used this tactic granted it is likely since then the statistic had changed although i presume it is close to the 2014 study this alone accounts for close to half the unauthorized immigrants in the us rubio and jeb bush have both said it and now so has ramos a news anchor said that 40 of illegal immigrants enter the states using air transportation now both of these numbers cant be added up because some of the overstayers i assume use air as a transportation method although likely not all so lets just say 70 of immigrants enter using the overstay method or just by planes this leaves us with 30 left seems reasonable today there is approximately 12 million unauthorized immigrants in the us 30 of that is 4 million which isnt bad thats a lot of people so assuming that the wall would stop that 30 would be plenty of reason to build it but fact if he matter is thst it wont not even all illegal immigrants cross the us southern border or even come from close countries in central america close to around 5060 of illegal immigrants are from central american countries so lets half that 30 number now we have 15 at this point its a questionable 21 billion dollars spending especially because immigrants account for a large amount of our economy within food export so for me we could build the wall its possible although people would find new ways just a out of the ass guess it would ultimately stop 510 of immigrants which isnt enough lets spend that money on fixing some frickin roads any car enthusiasts reading this no but in reality it would almost be useless a waste of money i dont know i dont presume to understand everything about immigration although it seems the wall would be much more of a display of power rather than an effective method of blocking illegal immigrants im happy to respond to some comments or counter arguments especially from mister crowder hope everyone has a good day
got to disagree with this one its just a massive waste of money and a distraction from the actual issues of immigration physical territory walls have always been almost completely useless throughout history and 100 of the time throughout history largescale walls lead to unrest in the population of both places 100 of the time
dude i dont think drug is only sent by a truck on a border man hollywod has made examples but i think has also melted brains
build the wallwith my ass
i dont think a wall is necessary we have to ask why people come into te usa illegaly and its mainly for money but who gives them money its businesses looking for cheap labor so the focus should be on the businesses hiring illegal immigrants punish them throw the owners in prison and shut them down
why is this so short this is unfair
they xray border wouldnt be crazy man
if that one dude becomes governor we will be in some shit people
this episode was awful you have 2 people who both are absolutely terrible at trying to change your mind the first didnt even count she needed help herself and the second was just a dumbass who came in for hype
wow this is way the world is fucked up stupidity wow
that is why us companies build more production plants in mexico because mexican engineers are super smart no joke
we are in 2018 dude dont make that face when the guy speaks his creative mind  lol
thats bs your statistics are fuckin bs who writes these stats the government fuckin duh of course if you leave your white bubble youd see how those statics are complete bs americans easily commit the huge majority of crimes its not even proportionate people who cross are so afraid to commit crimes and get deported they go through hell to stay away from it
alot of what that guy described was actually what happens with legal immigrationso make illegals come here legally rofl
i do not agree with crowder or building a border wall but jeez lots of respect to him for sitting through conversations with these idiots without snapping
how can you tax people who work under the table and people that the government doesnt even know are here
honestly compared to the other topics these guys didnt add much of a debate but they wasnt bad no major offenses just being civil i respect that it makes me understand their point more
anyone whos against the wall because they want illegals to come while they have a fence or lock their doors are al hypocrites
loool i dont wanna get out from topic says the man when being confronted on the fact that us citizenz may be part of the drug dealing thing
isnt a shooting commited by an student of your schools a disproportionated thing how is he even educated
hydrox is better than oreoschange my mind
say drug flow stops wouldnt all drug consumers just find another source
stevens face at the end lol
holy shit smdh wtf after watching this dude you seriously cant tell me the population isnt being dumbed down you know i been thinking about becoming the governor of new mexico too i think ill be governor right after him would be a hard act to follow thats for sure hes one bright knife thats for sure oh i mean sharp light
make a video about the shootings
god bless his soul the next face of new mexico everybody
santa fe  is a shit hole i cant imagine why
wall is a complete waste of money change my mind
honestly if i were you i would do this video again you think these are the best responses or conversations you can get i know people much more educated on this subject then the ones you have interviewed but not everyone has all the statistics or are prepared to change your mind on these matters on the spot unfortunately there are a lot of ignorant people who wanna speak on the subject without really knowing what they are talking about that doesnt mean that people against the wall have a flawed or incorrect argument you just need to discuss this with someone equally educated on the matter who can debate as well as you can and maybe they can actually change your mind but only if you are actually open to changing it
ok ok just everyone with brown skin that will make everything better yeah thats it thats the ticket
just let the whole world come in it will make everything better
uh yeah you are not spanish
some real winners in this edition of change my mind not lol incoherent babbling is all i heard and nothing realistic wow hahha
so he wants the nwo
why is she whispering to him lol its obviously being recorded both video and audio her going close to him and cusping her hand around her mouth is not gonna make what she says only available to him
waste of time and money
that dude does not look spanish at all
scientifical oh my
dumba people give them a ss and tax them ilmfao the majority of the illegal immigrants are not working and the democrat party wants to support them with welfare checks free health care free housing and food ilmfao american citizens who have lived here all their lives and they need help but illegal immigrants are taking all of their money for help build the wall ship all the illegals out of the country and too bad americans firsttrump maga 2020 
lol most dont want jobs  thay sit back n collect  why work
xxxtentacion is still alive change my mind
wow next governor of nm folks hes literally explaining how a fucking passport works reinventing the wheel jackass
guys cranked up on methplain and simpleits scientifical 
really this was the best counter arguement  i believe anyone could sit and speak its telling the lack of ideas and counter points
listening to this guy gave me cancer stupidity like this should be illegal please delete this immediately
340 thats sad 
im for private boarders not government boarders government is evil
these people are morons that being said this conservative douche thinks he is always right and that everyone who disagrees with him is wrong its called change my mind but he never discusses with an open mind
xd that spanish guys logic cracked me up hahaha
i watch and listen to the show and this is one of the few topics i cant get on board with i am anti wall and i think lighter immigration standards would help the united states of america
no i dont know like masterminds you know like good god help us
shoulda swiped left on that dude
033 wow people are such immature ignorant morons
when you see mexicans raising there countrys flag over our in our own country that should tell you everything that is wrong with illegal immigration if you want to be an american citizen thats fine by me just do it legally and love and respect the country you want to belong too if you come to our country with intentions of not following our laws or assimilating then you can just stay in your own damn country its really that simple
i never thought a change my mind would be this short
every time i watch these videos i get mad because i wish i was there to change his mind
not all people that oppose of the wall are morons this guy doesnt represent us
i both cant afford mugclub and am a cheap prick
you gained that 2nd million subscribers quick congrats sir
wished the guy he talked to was smarter  i think i actually lost brain cells watching this one
i dont think illegal immigrants who have lived in the us for a long period of time and no history of crime should be deported and if anything they should be given an advantage in gaining citizenship only those committing crimes should be deported the wall will cost billions and billions of dollars and people will find a way to get around it its a waste will someone please counter my opinion in the reply section because i genuinely dont understand why people think this is a smart idea
scientifical
1316 lolllllll
ldo this one again  the subject of building a wall on our border is  far from closed 
statistically they the one bringing the drugzuh but statistically who the one selling the drugzuhgood point
interview smarter people my issue is not with their stance just their literacy and argumentative logic skills
let that man make policy hes clearly a genius
long sleeve shirts with shorts should be illegal change my mind
that second guy wants to tag all the immigrants with electronic devices and make money off of them  holy fuck
the just had a very intelligent conversation with the future governor of new mexico this will go down in history
hmmmits excruciatingly painful to watch an idiot i mean that second person is basically having his own conversation hes not even touching on the subject matterhis viewpoints and arguments are warped i hope he erased his footage and never posted it
i hear pogo
crowded is a conservative but he wants to tax people against their will to build a wall that people will just tunnel under and climb over not to mention the terrain spanning the entire border is nearly impossible to pass much less build a wall through crowder my big govt socialism is the best
they should enforce immigration polices but not build a wall cus they gonna get in one way or another its just a huge waste of money its gonna gonna help anything most immigrants dont even travel on foot its mostly through a airplane
i came back to this video just to see more awesome comments about leroy
both people were idiots
every time someone makes a good point against crowders faulty arguments he says i dont want to get off topic here so lets go back to crowder is a classic narcissist and he even exhibits other psychopathic behaviors
miracle whip is better than mayonnaisechange my mind
i give steven points for keeping his cool during these interviews  the level of stupidity that comes out of a lot of these people is astounding
httpswwwnytimescominteractive20170306uspoliticsundocumentedillegalimmigrantshtmlin the link from the new york times it does agree with the 35 of the population are illegal immigrants but only contribute to 75 of crime another thing it says is that most illegal immigrants are overstaying visas instead of crossing the border so the wall would be useless as most people come by plane or other kind of transportation
wow that dude is fucking stupid like i have no words really lolhe had to be trolling like he really just had to be trolling
im an immigrant im legal come here legally its a basic matter i dont care how hard you work thus is the law follow it
ihop is not ihob change my mind
his ideas are wayyyyy worse than a wall wtf
xray gate the radiation alone oh wow dude
this was not worth showing this is propaganda to show how dumb the left is i wanted to see an actual discussion with someone knowledgeable
he wants to be governor and his familys been in new mexico since the 15hundreds but for some reason he cant talk right and sound retarded lol
im glad this guys at least gave it a try but it is really sad to see how much he is missing in the whole scheme of things it seems as if crowder is talking to a twelve year old
i love this series but j cant watch because these peoples arguments are so cringeworthy i have to turn it off
heres a great explanation of why building the wall and hardening the border in general will backfire and has worsened the problem httprevisionisthistorycomepisodes25generalchapmanslaststand
scientifical
really a xray something lol
i would have changed his mind on this one the wall stricter enforcement ect  is granting government more power steven is falling for the lefts game government creates a problem social safety net the actual disease and lets conservatives use that as the justification for more government being played like fiddle
make a law where illegals are not citizens but they still pay taxes theres you funding for a wall
guy is saying we need xray scannerhmmmm that means we need superman because he has xray vision
proof that we are devolving
i just want an xray scannerwhat surprised me the most is how you were able to restrain yourself while speaking to this fellowhes gonna run for governor of new mexicoremind me not to go there
xray boarder wtf is this guy talking about
building a wall is an expensive bandaid and is not a solution why not look at the reasons immigrants are coming into this country illegally and fix those if you think it is for welfare or anchor babies making amendments to the laws would seem easier than a giant wall that has to go through many peoples properties against their wishes many immigrants just want to work jobs that many americans wont getting in the country legally is not easy especially if you have no family connections here  if laws are unreasonable people will break them imagine if your state set the speed limit on the highway to 20 mph would you consider yourself a criminal speeding in it many of the problems that central america including mexico faces is the dangers from drug wars there are many immigrants seeking safety in the us why not focus on eliminating the drug wars there are much easier and more effective solutions than building a giant wall and hiring a bunch of security the wall is dumb change my mind
the only thing i am curious of is were their any other interviews done that day the two that you chose to show didnt seem to debate you or at least have what i feel was a cohesive argument against what you are asking of them
meh while i would like to be in a world without borders where you can just go wherever you want and live wherever you want without too much hassle i know it will not happen any time soon still going from that guys idea you could enforce some kind of app that tells the government if you are in the country or out of it its not something that i would want to happen as the government would know where you are at any point in time with high accuracy and it would only be somewhat feasible in developed countries and even then not everyone will have a smartphone
i want to furiously abuse my meat change my mind
no drogas
bro is that my church van
this open dialogue was not as productive like some of the other change my mind sessions its possible the last individual to speak with crowder might be struggling with a developmental disorder plus other issues he was incoherent and mispronounced the word scientific which seemed to hint at this
drugsa
the guy has a point lasers on the boarders if you dont have a chip your toast  if that does not work immediate execution will
where does crowder get his figure about illegals committing 37 of all murders in america just curious i couldnt find it
this was soo bad im against building a wall but this leroy dude didnt have a concrete or reasonable argument do a 2nd edition on this with better arguments
i couldnt stop laughing my ass off at that prageru ad with shapiro at the beginning so i actually watched the full 4 minutes without skipping lol so stupid
wow you just cut an actual interview to strawman
if we live our lives off of statistics we will have nothing change
the main guy that he spoke to is a prime example of the problem in the us he is clearly uneducated but overly opinionated and driven by emotions instead of logic he actually thinks he can run for governor of new mexico
lets make a wall and to shut the liberals the fuck up put solar panels on top of it so it provides energy and resources so that this argument of it being a waste of money can be put to an end
my home town
this man wants views and attention change my mind
i agree on the wall i agree immigrants bring most drugs into the states but like the first guy said its not just immigrates responsible for the drugs if there wasnt an ecomony for drugs in the states by americans there wouldnt be a huge traffic for drugs
this idiot just described us customs as his solution
even flatearthers seem smarter than this dude
that guy wants a border that cost hundreds of trillions of dollars lol with people having rfid tags embedded into them wow that sounds like a fun world but hey you get to go where ever you want with big brother watching over you the whole time mmmm great times
so if people start entering your home would you put a lock on the door
trump hating mexicans is wayyyy behind the point now people should realize more important facts like trump getting peace treaties from korea n shit
well worth watching just for the look on your face at the end lol dont forget to build the wall around california
okay so now steven try to get informed folks to sit down with you for a change my mind on a side note leroy should consider being some type of preacheruh 
37 of murders are commited by 35 of illegals i kinda doubt that anytime i hear of a murder its a white male citizen
heres what i dont getwhy do people think mexicans come here to do crime they could do the exact same thing in mexico believe it or not people wouldnt want to risk coming across illegally if theyre going to do the exact same thing plus police are much much tighter here than down there people that are coming illegally dont want to be criminals they are people who used to be criminals but have turned a new leaf and want to start over here but cant pass the background checkplus if anything the wall would just keep people in the bulk of illegal immigrants want to come in work for a bit then go back to their families in mexico the wall will just encourage people to stay in making things worse rather than better also over 30 of illegal immigrants came here legally on planes and merely overstayed their visa what will a wall do about thatbut lets say it worked perfectly lets say the wall worked completely perfectly and absolutely no more immigrants came in would it even be worth it then have you ever stopped to think about how much it would cost to build a wall nobody could break or climb through the thousands of miles of rough terrain that is the us southern border billions the type of money we dont haveoh i also should probably include the fact that this isnt the fucking sims that shit wont build in 24 hours you know how long skyscrapers take to build imagine a thousands of miles unbreakable unclimbable wall if it started today trump could get a second term which he damn well wont and hed still be out if office by the time it was done but why should you believe me you dont have to but youll believe congress when even the republicans that let him carry through with all of his dumbass decisions shut his shit down in minutes
i bet trump himself has received more illegally tax free income than every single illegal immigrant combined
oh my lord that wasstrange to say the least i hope you called ice when he walked away or at least the cops because someone was high  lol  great job out there you guys keep it up stay safe
that guy sees a false future
crowder is the ultimate ideologue  i shouldnt be able to see one or two of a persons views on politcalsocial issues and be able to guess the rest of them with almost 100 accuracy
that first woman was obviously drunkthe second person  is an idiot
anything for ratings right even if it means that woman dies from what you put on blast their was a reason she was whispering your a d bag
that last guy was a tweaker and he kept contradicting himself with not wanting a wall usa should build a wall  and have some type of satellite intel from anything that moves out of that border
im a cheap prick you dont have to change my mind
httpsdiscordggugwgf7t  invite to a new intellectual discord server for political discussion similar to this change my mind series if youre interested join up and have a good time
is that first lady taking a plant out for a walk
holy shit that mexican dude has no idea what hes talking about so he wants to force mexico to idchip all their residents super illegal and then create an xray wall that scans the idchips when they come through so we can start taxing them ummmmmm yyyyeeeeeaaaaaa
scientifical  fucking a these people man and the people who just yell out dont have the decency to say it to someones face
if your family were in new mexico since the 1500s then you are mexican old mexico once owned new mexico
stevencrowder only argues with stupid people because thats all hes capable of  change my mind
build the wall buy mexico is not paying for it
please dont make him governor 
omg such a facepalm the entire time this guy was talking
1318 my exact reaction
xray border  wakanda forever
i know that bitch
new mexicos soon to be  governor is talking about making an xray machine lol i feel for new mexico
the second guys main point let them in so we can tax them but very often those immigrants will earn the money from an american business and then send as much as they can back home
it is okay to be white change my mind
building a wall will cost a lot in the building  take land from american land owners  will cost money to upkeep  wont keep them out  i think if you increased the prosecution and punishment of people that hire illegals you would save more money and if there is no jobs here they wont come
hope she is safe fools you have change her voice or compltely block her
im against the wall because its too expensive im not against a 40foot electric fence though 20 feet underground and 20 feet above ground also hire legal mexicans to speed up the immigration process for those trying to actually come here legally continue to have border police to prevent drone deliveries of drugs the fence would also lessen the amount of border police needed
so when is that zionist puppet going to build the wall
i dont know what you have to do to become a citizen but they need to pass the tests
maybe like idk jus maybe we cud jus like maybe idk xray checkpoints 
build the wall
i do not understand why people are so dull
wow a lot of people have oversimplified solutions to a problem thats been raging since i was in high school and im an old fart if it was so easy to fix it would have been fixed a long time ago  people want money put towards reforms but money has already been put towards reforms over the years  things have only gotten worse  we need a border we need to know who is coming here  migrants need to enter the legal way so they can start their path to citizenship  it makes me so angry to know illegals receive more benefits than actual citizens  they dont want to be americans but they want all the rights that go with being a citizen they also want to be able to travel back and forth they get paid under the table and send the money back home to mexico i dont have to explain why criminals dont want citizenship when i was in service one of the guys i worked with joined the navy just to get his citizenship  it took him four years and he finally got it  we shut down to throw him a party and he didnt have to but about a week later he reenlisted for another four years  that man is an american and a true patriot he worked damned hard for his citizenship there are people like him all across america and they have to see their hard work basically spit on by people who just want all the advantages but dont want to work for them  illegals who protest while raising the mexican flag and saying they hate america so yes build the wall
its honestly not even really enjoyable when the people who come up to speak are this stupid
wall technology seems outdated and overpriced next to drones and sensors which get cheaper by the day
only someone who is lacking in the critical thinking department has to crowd the person whos changing your mind intimidation and lacks the communication necessary to properly exchange ideas sad
dude 1005 has done some drugs
wtf is an xray gate
but why would mexico pay for the wall its kinda funny cuz mexicos the largest cement producer in the world
this is ultra cringe worthy yikes
come more south of texas to the actual border cities
i believe usa would be better with cr7 for president change my mind
haha oh wow that was painful i hope the man that was interviewed gets to watch this and reflects on it before he tries to make being the governor of new mexico a reality
so 1550s spanish guy wants to reward them for breaking the law
this man will be governor of santa fe
i agree with the first woman for once i think we should let people immigrate legally and diminish the number of illegal immigrants somehow but i think a wall from coast to coast is a bit much you know d not that i have a better solution though
scientifical
lmao that look after leroy left hahahaha
lol that look crowder as the camera pans into your face at the end
dont want illegal immigrants stop hiring illegal immigrants
hey idiots  over 90 of undocumented immigrants get here by plane  many others by boat  also there already are walls  are you seriously asserting that we should spend billions of dollars on something that kinda makes it a little harder for around 5 of the people youre saying are the problem  goddamn you folks are dumb
new mexico in its finest
deffo not sending their brightest
physical border yes technologicalid tag hell notoo logans runtoo big brother read 1984people do you really like the idea of the government having access to your locale 247 if that happens i am going underground
should be im not mexican change my mind
why did this not trend build the wall i would say lets not even wait lets just build the wall volunteer
china yea build a wall it really worked well for us
what put a tariff tax on people who come in across the boarder lol leroy is a bit confused and seemingly dont really know what going on in the political sense with that said however leroy seems to be a nice guy that should count for somethingright at least hes not threatening to beat up the republicans or bring violence to those who dont agree with his views which by the wayis the way its supposed to be non violent discussionsdebates tho we know demslibs have a problem with that sadly
incredibles was a mediocre movie and incredibles 2 is pointless change my mind
build a wall all around america so the rest of the world can be protected
okay wow that kid has definitely been sucked in by globalists  hes not viewing immigration realistically he wants to be mayor i think he said of new mexico one day so hes already made a goal for himself that puts him way ahead of most kids his age unfortunately  he also has a very child like view of the world around him  hes mixing fantasy with reality
that guy was straight out of idiocracy
this guy wants to give people crossing the border cancer with his xray attacks what a maniac can you imagine the medical bills for these border cancer attacksthis guy want to be a the govenor lol
1138i dont know i one day plan on being the governor of new mexicolmao this fucking guy
leroy 2020
irl streaming cancer 404
i think use the money to hire way more border control forces which provides more jobs i mean a wall is a little bit dumb illegal immigrants who are eager for a new life will find a way to go through the border
building the wall will work some what but it wouldnt because people get here legally then over stay visas or they come in on the beach in small rafts the wall would only help 1 form of illegal immigration
thanos did nothing wrong change my mind
well that one sucked super genius xray wall xd
the wall will be built and trump will be reelected in 2020 you heard it here first
only 32 signatures please support acosta petition thank youhttpswwwthepetitionsitecom585134183revokejimacostaspresscredintalsjim acosta needs to be shut down demand more from all reporters representing our nation domestic and abroad sign and share today 
do america is the greatest country in the world change my mind
the videos are getting shorter and shorterand the cuts are also suspiciousnot easy to see someone who wins against crowder
this video got nowhere he spent most of the time talking to that lunatic  ive met people like that  whacked  i support a wall andor some type of border security 100 i also would like to see an easier immigration policy for them  setting aside economic problems from illegal migration im mostly fearful of health concerns  could you imagine if the zika virus was much more contagious and spread through the states theres plenty of reasons to have controlled immigration  its just tough to balance policy and compassion
someone needs to immediately remove this idiots front door and put a sign on his lawn come on in maybe hell learn that borders are necessary
people on the border are actually mainly in favor of the wall because itll provide federal jobs i also happen to live in a border city and some people in mexico shoot bullets at the buildings on the other side of our measly fence we literally have bullet holes in the university here so a wall would prevent the bullets from reaching us territory
my one if with it is that the majority of illegal immigrants fly in money would be better off being given to police or whatever to make sure people leave the country when theyre supposed to
just spewing the trash the media pours into this mans brain
he says tax them they dont even have the money to pay for getting their immigration states legalized much less are they going to want to pay taxes
leroy needs to lay off the tina
did this man just describe the mark of the beast as a good thing really
i hope that lady is safe  this is what makes me angry citizens need to be protected  sanctuary cities are a sham that poor woman left her country to have a better life  she didnt come here to have to deal with the exact same things she was escaping from
build the xray wall
omg  while on the surface this guy sounds batsht crazy   then i think to myself  this guys idea sounds kind of like rfid tagging  and also a lot like a significant step towards the biblical mark of the beast   i always thought there was no way anyone would voluntarily be chipped and have their bio identity stored and used to track them etc   but it is already taking place in india where they are using a system called aadhaar  this utilizes a 12digit unique identity number that can be obtained and utilized by residents of india based on their individual and unique biometric and demographic data aadhaar can track them and be utilized for buying and selling etc   im still for building a wall
white privilege doesnt exist  change my mind just have security on hand
statistically theyre the ones bringing the drugs but you have to ask who are the ones selling the drugsid imagine they are selling the drugs i cant imagine they are just bringing millions or billions of dollars across the border every year to just give to white people who sell drugs they are loading themselves up with drugs and coming over at great risk just to give drugs to white people to sell and make money yeah that makes a lot of fuckin senseanybody today nowadays is creating crimes you know its just how people are you knowno asshole i dont know i am trying to live my life and stay free i dont go around breaking the law to advance my place in the world that would make me a fuckin criminal this is why sometimes voting and debate about these things should be left to property ownersit seems to me that once a person owns things that they are responsible for they have a profound respect for the law
that guy is talking about a airport  point of entry of most countries
wowi cant believe these are real people living in this world i cannot even handle it lol
that was the accumulated thoughts over a period of three years holy cow
so many idiots try talking to you surprised you had a slow day its not hard to say why a massive wall is dumb as fuck not because you shouldnt have strong immigration policies but because its just a waste of money having legal immigrants and having people registered is in the best interest of all parties but to think a wall is somehow going to solve anything youre more delusional than the far left nutjobs
i love how when i click on this video theres an advertisement for my local democratic hor candidate just luring in young people for promises that i know for a fact would not pass for the condition my county is in its such a shame that more people are yelling at each other rather than engaging with each other in civil conversation i am a centrist who wants to just logically discuss both sides of the coin but this divided country makes it so rough to actually do so god bless america and god bless what you do much love for everyone who can keep a peaceful conversation 
the main counter argument is that the president who proposed the initiative has a background with large scale construction companies so its just a huge conflict of interest  its not so different from the presidents that get gibs from the military industrial complex to start wars 
this was one of the more mind numbing conversations youve done
its just a huge waste of money
maybe you just dont get many of them but i wish you would edit in more if the good convos you have with mature adults like the first woman you disagreed on some things but the conversation just went well its annoying watching you go back and forth with someone where you both will never agree
one of my employees was an illegal immigrant she came here when she was 12 and was drugged doesnt remember anything her husband waited three years to get here legally she knows people like her make him wait longer and pay more she even says it now build the fucking wall
i think it would be hilarious if you did a its okay to be white change my mind i would love to hear what people would say
minority deport
do these cunts understand that mexico built a wall in the south of mexico due to illegal immigration lmao
1316
you know cartels are so against the wall and the tight security that is happeining in the border they honestly want to control a piece of american soil just like the control varies parts of mexico and the people
yo come to albuquerque talk about this here these people need their own thoughts
i want enforced adult nap times in the work place change my mind 
shoot on site its cheaper and itll get the point across to go through a check point
this guys on his way to being a socialist dictator
do a change my mind on why eating cows and other meats isnt bad
prime reason our country id failing ignorance with a feeling of righteousness taxing them does not generate wealth when they are below poverty to begin with i would argue no wall build turrets instead
wholly shit what kind of drugs was this guy on
something about isral would be intresting
this dude is an idiot the dems are happy to have him as a voter
hahahaha i had a spanish ad before the video
where the hell is he getting those fake statistics
cant you just go around the wall
i need to move to new mexico so i can vote for leroy to be the next governor
im not educated much on this topic at all but this will probably change my mind
should just send the us military into mexico and eliminate all the cartelsmaybe do something about their corrupt government too
this guy is a retard haha
hahaha the blank stare at the end was priceless did i just enter the twilight zone
funny how some mexicans want to make america mexico again if you feel that way then why arent you living in mexico if you love it so much and think its so great cause its the second most dangerous country in the world keep these people out of our country build the wall
the fact is non whites what to come to the white mans lands americaeurope because america and europe are the best places on earth non whites cant build a society like whites can and the examples of that are easy to see all over the world zionists jews and brain washed whites bring all the non whites to america europe to destroy it from the inside out little by little they destroy the laws and culture and breed out the whites slowly replacing whites with non whites  and thats 100 what zionists want and easy to control working slaves
i prefer reform and real penalties over a wallwalls can be used to keep us in eventually as well so thats my stance
you censored her face but didnt censor her name tag hanging off her neck oo
build a wall then put that dude in it stop the propagation of the uneducated
the reason i dont want the wall is because were supposed to learn from history not repeat it i think the wall trump wants to build is similar to the berlin wall we are repeating history by separating families already that needs to be stopped
racism is no longer a problem change my mindkeep in mind i dont believe this but it would be interesting
this guy is laughable what world does he live in i think hes the long lost son of the jetsons
lets scan their bones for the id code with the xray scanner
redo
so a wall is to expensive but and xray wall isnt dudes a genius
xray scanner this dude been doing some of them illeagal drugs
phil robertson had a good video about the wall not sure what it was called but it was very interesting and made a good point actually it was called kepp you eye on the wall in the woods with phil ep49 should check it out
first guy is describing the mark of the beast being tagged also they know where you are
this is exactly what we need in our country conversation and civil debate i personally think the immigration issue in particular is a false issue created by both sides of the establishment media to keep the american people divided to distract us from the real issues we need to come together to fix the system for example money in politics is a huge problem only after we fix the fundamental issues can we discuss these other issues such as immigration gun control etc im a liberal by the way were not all irrational race baiters
wish it was longer  thats what she said 
the wall is dumb not effective immigration restrictions are good though id prefer better policies than a wall tbh
illegals are immigrants that want to skip the line and walk right in try doing that at the dmv and see what happens
steven  next time ask them what should legal immigrants get for doing it the right way if they insist on passing out social security s and citizenship certificates like candy
the earth is round change my mind
why has she got a bottle with a plant in it
why does youtube let you skip the ads for conservatives and not the ones for liberals
stevencrowder please help me understand something i dont understand the logic of the leftso trump is hitler and our country is run by fascists so why are you fighting so hard for illegal immigrants and their children to come here wouldnt you be telling them to run far away and for that matter since you all hate guns why are you still here you are living in a fascist country run by the definition of evil you have no way to resist if it comes knocking and you are inviting more people and all of their innocent children to share in your impending halocaust
feminism isnt needed anymore  change my mind
should be deporting all of them i love mexican culture but we dont need more low income workers im a high school graduate in california and its almost impossible to find entry level jobs that pay over 15hour
this guy must have alot of free thoughts lol
theyre ok with the current fence but not ok with a wall imo anyone who is against the wall should legally be forced to keep their doors unlocked at all times
mexico needs to end their drug war change my mind
where is that 37 percent murder start from im a hundred percent against illegal immigrantion pro wall and so on but that stat seems unrealistic to me i know hispanics are lumped in with whites in the fbi crime stats but thats a huge number
america is supposed to be land of the free its supposed to be a place where we help the ones in need and offer our helping hand to the needy but also wanna build a fence to keep the most needy outsure sone people are gonna come in a commit crimeslol what about the people who are american citizens that commit crimes we dont kick them out the country most people trying to come in this country are in need and seeking safety from the hell that their country brings on themwho tf are we to say another human cant come on this part of the earth we all live on this planet and it belongs to all of us same goes for other countries that wont let americans in its one earth we are all humans inhabiting the same earth
okay it doesnt take much research to see that trump most definitely did say that mexicans are coming in and bringing drugs and committing a bunch of crime the thing is hes right so why deny it
mexico is a shhole because of the uss war on drugs in many ways the us has created the illegal immigration problem
the wall is a waste of money most come by air or boat and it destroys wildlife and landscape
i hope this guy leroy never becomes governor of new mexico
crowders homicidemurder statistic was incorrect
my iq went down 5 pts watching this
are many americans this dumb
the spanish guy with the gopro is so misinformed dude wants everything the antichrist wants
the woman is at least honest but has really no reason to oppose a wall the guy is embarrassing in his view on just about everything he expressed  i truly feel bad for the quality of brain cells he was given to work with in life
that leroy clownlolmexican god help us if borders become a thing of the  pastuh
we already have a wall its called a giant fence the run along the mexican american border
where does your information on illegal immigrants and crime come from im very curious can anyone provide a link
the guy in the white shirt definitely isnt an idiot  he brought up some good ideas
i was not racist before watching this
the thought of how many families will suffer when faced with the decision of  continue living in corruptviolentpoverty stricken mexico or use tunnels owned and operated by the cartels  when those are your only 2 options something will break  its sad it seems that a lot more people have to die before mexico gets their  together   i think the wall is more about forcing mexico to deal with its own corruption than it is about enforcing immigration
wouldnt the percentage of illegal immigrants who commit crimes be 100
lets just have mexico and central america surrender their land over to the united states and we can make a mega united states
the ending was inconsiderate crowder i work full time and dont have the luxury to give to random people on social media money i dont have that comment about free loading was kinda hurtful so thumbs down for that
really wish some halfway intelligent people sat down to debate this because there are many legitimate reasons not to waste money building a giant wall i support enforcing immigration law but not the stupid wall
i will give it a try borders in general is a wall that is suppose to keep illegal immigrants out or make it harder for them to go into us however increasing the borders is one thing build  a wall has different meaning it is like locking away the mexican if we walk next to each other and i tell you you cannot come this way that would be like creating a statement that is monking you and you make the other person feeling abused or bullied while i believe in a world without borders with the current age it is a thing that ofc each country has to safeguard
youre spanish not mexican but your family has been in mexico since the 1500s
well i was torn between laughing my ass off at leroy and being genuinely terrified by his propositions  i wonder if hes give any thought to the extreme ramifications of his xray wall  essentially every person in this country would be giving up their freedom by allowing the government to pin point us at all times  sure you could claim that the tagging  was only for illegals but according to leroy they would be given citizenship and taxed  that means that the entire population of the us would also need to be tagged  there are plenty of people out there who im sure wont think thats a big deal because they dont think that they are doing anything that would warrant the government monitoring them but they would be wrong  we are already being closely monitored by the nsa without consent so why would anyone be naive enough to think that this xray border wall would be different  what if a person holds different political religious or social opinions to the party in power would those people then be targeted  probably  there are a myriad of reasons why his ideas are disastrous and detrimental to everyone
you blurred her face but left her name badge clear oops
these people are fucking morons
do a fat acceptance is wrong one
i actually disagree with the building a wall it was reported that the majority of illegal immigrants are coming in on planes most illegal immigrants are coming in legally but their they become illegal when their green cards and visa cards expires
leroy had a good heart it was in the right place but his mind is to brainwashed by liberal media
fuck ice
you should definately have done more to conceal the first womans identity especially as you captioned on screen what she believe to be confidential when she asked how to report criminals in her locality im a fan of yours but not good enough she could realistically be in danger of some of them saw this
xray wall did you manage to talk to someone intelligent what were their arguments
this poor guy has no idea what hes talking ideas bouncing every which way not making much sense also whats with the backpack
i dont believe in statisticschange my mind
this guy is all over the place  he has no opinion on this topic
build the wall pussiez we got tunnels fucking morons
its illegal immigration for a reason we gotta keep most out
the people that you interviewed make my brain hurt
build the wall  secure the border 110 idk where our fellow millennials who lean left or libertarian get the idea that borders are fading into the past nowhere is that happening or even being discussed except fringe groups theyre necessary for a functioning law abiding civil society that values freedom so dumb those people yelling at the windows are just ignorant spergs xray scanning border yet borders will be a thing of the past how can we tax these immigrants if we have no border or checks  balances to id or monitor these people he doesnt seem to know much about the issues or the data but i like that he is thinking of ideas  at least he was civil stevens face at the end 
make the xray border great again the 2nd guy is a moron
what a fucking retard that first guy was i mean god damn
xray device although clever  is still a wall  or a barrier in a way
that dude is an absolute bumbling idiot
that guy from new mexico that is against the wall and taxing the illegal immigrants doesnt make any sense at all he is way out there i knew then he is totally lost in his argument
build the walleven if it doesnt reduce number of illegals crossing it may require more than 50 iq which may drastically increase their intelligence and act as de facto vetting
dude said hes spanish 
this guy cant is a we bit off lol
scientifical
id like to debate the future governor of new mexico there ill eschew any prep time
i feel like you should redo this one those two people didnt seem to have a well developed idea of the topic at hand i feel this topic would be deserving of a redo
hahhahahahahahahahhahahahahaha i was praying for some kind of acknowledgement that this guy was delusional 1316
thats the stronger argument for the wall if you american when he said its never gonna stop
this is america not mexico 
it took him three years to come up with thati am dying hahaha
put a wall shiiit ill get my happy ass a ladder
1038 this dude living in 2060
what percent of legal citizens use illegal drugs they are only here to traffic the drugs because their is a market for it why not focus on the people actually using the drugs if you take away the drug trafficking americans will still find ways to get the drugs their addicted too mexicans just saw a business opportunity and took advantage of it
as a mexican myself build the wall
this solution for digital tracking is much more controlling than borders we have now
damm people are stupid
so no wall mark of the beast instead
build the ray
make them all citizens make them all pay taxes make them have a immigrants revolutionwait that happened before
457but that is what we do to normal citizens
wow that xray guy was dumb af the sad thing is that he thinks hes smart 
that dude is a loser go green global is a dump
the comical thing is that there is already a wall it has already been built years ago you can either go to the border and see it for yourself or have a google also people speak about lack of or poor border security my experience has been that we have excellent border security there are large border patrol facilities that are supported with agents trucks atvs helicopters and more if you are around the border you will be stopped and question by the border patrol pretty quickly ive been stopped five times in one day but check it out for yourself go walk around the border and see how quickly you will be approached and questioned by the border patrol
i sort of agree with that first lady the wall is very expensive and they will just dig under it as they have been doing the wall wont keep them out
that 37 statistic is wrong change my mind
omg that face at the end 
i feel like my iq dropped by 10 points listening to leroy
i believe we should keep the wall we have now and invest on more border patrol creating more jobs for americans and creating a safer boarder at the same time we should also give immigrants legal or illegal  a reform that they would have to qualify for to become legal recidents and fund deportation of illegal immigrants with bad records
next governor of new mexico
lol so many people are pressed because this video lacks intelligent arguments from the opposing side as if thats stevens fault you do understand the problem with that logic right its not as if he makes a conscious decision to speak to people who are less educated than him and its known he doesnt edit his videos to make it appear that way either he literally just sits there and talks to whoever is willing to debate plus he even stated that barely anyone wanted to converse about this topic anyways but hey when your side doesnt have a legitimate rebuttal blame your opposer i guess
that dude is the guy you hate to talk to at a party because he swears he knows everything but really doesnt know shit
im sure there were more people who spoke to him that day a lot of people have an opinion on this show a real conversation please with someone who knows what they are talking about
an xray gate  wow 
hold on hold on nowceech might be on to something here we line the border with xray emitters scanners crank those bitches up to 11 anyone who doesnt cross in a legal safe zone gets bug zapped andor glows in the dark for a week its beautiful
this guy is from new mexico and i am from new mexico and god forbid this guy get elected into a public office new mexico has turned to shit under democrat sanctuary city stances albuquerque is one of the most dangerous cities in the country you cannot drive anywhere without seeing a vagrant in every street corner bumming for money and if you watch carefully they switch out with another when their shift is over a pimp picks them up and drops off another and what did albuquerque do this last mayoral race we elected another democrat to continue this because the majority of the population is generational hispanic democrats who vote d down the board no matter what its actually so bad i will be moving my family in the next year so good on ya bud drive out families who make  150000 incomes and drive in the sanctuary city detroit is where albuquerque is headed
that guy is an idiot you cant tax people if theyre not citizens and if youre making everyone a citizen theres no point in citizenship not to mention his xray scanner is a thing that already exists its called customs and its how you get into the countryplus even if you tax them more which is probably unconstitutional its probably going to cost more to keep them here than youll make off of them does he think doctors are coming in illegally no its poor people trying to get on welfare and you cant earn money from them if youre the one giving them money in the first place
lol 1140 notgayjared saying good talk made my day  though its hard to tell if thats what he said with all the muffmouth
i think we should just xray em
hey steven i am a viewer from israel we already have wallsand franklywithout themwe would get mass genocided
borders are there which shape or form they have doesnt even matter imo because it doesnt matter if there is a wall youre not allowed to pass illegally or a guarded entrance point you are not allowed to pass illegally i think there are two issues with this physical border firstly its an economic problem because most certainly the mexicans wont pay for that lol and i dont think the american citizens want their hard earned money to go into something criminals just hop over the second one which is i think the main point why people are against a wall is that it seems unethical we had walls in our history before germany and the pictures of this time dont connote a happy societyi know that this wall wouldnt seperate a country itself but still a lot of families would have it much more difficult to see each other moving into an open world where everyone has the freedom to travel around freely accept new people and live in plurality the building of a wall would be the exact opposite picture of tolerance acceptance and embracement of new people and culture even if it doesnt intend to do so i get the point as long as you are legal the wall wouldnt change anythingeveryone would still be welcomed legally it doesnt even change anything right now because that same wall is already there imaginative since you cantshouldnt  just get into america illegally in its core i think that everyone is for and against that wall because you are most definitely not racist steven everyone wants to separate the bad sheeps from the good ones so we can live in peace and harmony oh my fuck i wrote all of this if i only was half as encouraged in school
money lending not laundering
that spanish guy is retarded
does anyone know where the disproportionate crime rate from illegal immigrants statistic came from
there you go the future governor of new mexico  selfdeclared  what could go wrong
xray walls 
that 2nd person wanted some crazy globalist ish
dude with he white shirt has good intentions but not educated enough on the subject
i believe that its fair that this country wants to secure illegal immigration i come from a family with an illegal parent so they may disagree with me on that but one way or another they will find another unique way to sneek in so no matter how much we try they will keep coming in and as to the wall its the worse idea ever its a huge waste of money considering that most come in the country with visa and just overstay
lmaoo these ppl sitting down dont know anything about living in mexico fuck all the statistics nobody knows what it is for the hispanic ppl and what they have to go through to have a better life and what do they do they separate families and deport everyone thats bs maybe yall should try to help those ppl instead of trying to keep them out
steven you need to either cut out that part where she asks you how to deport the illegals she knows or you need to blur her a lot better just imagine what would happen if one of those illegals came across this video and finds out it was her her life would be in danger
lol so lets say youre at a walmart with only selfcheckout lanes no cameras no security and no laws on the book to prevent you from stealing that would be the border ctfu
i wish i knew this guy engaged in his youtube base with the same change my mind format i get why he doesnt but its sad when id love you jump into this paneli think a wall is a purely symbolic gesture for the us a physical wall i dont believe will stop people from coming into the country illegallyi think illegal immigrants are given a bad wrap as inherently bad people because they happen to break a single law the us expects them to be murderers thieves killers the like i dont agree that that is likely at alli think the solution to fixing the immigration problem is to simplify the process of legal immigration financially and bureaucratically immigration isnt in itself a problem america doesnt need to be sheltered by foreigners who are able and willing to work harder for less pay because that level of competition stimulates an economy
theres already places with walls that been there and the spanish foo deserves a neck bruh the border got ppl already working there and doing literally what he described bruh how you gunna talk about something you dont know
the wall has doors people you can still come and go legally jesus christ help our public schools thats a good topic for change my mind why our public schools are failing lol
1550s wtf lol sit your ass down haha
my problem with the was is what it will do to the wildlife and its probably a trap to keep americans on this side when crap goes down
this guy just makin up words left and right haha
you cant just pull any random idiot off the street and use him to represent this issue or one side of the aisle these people have not thought through their own thoughts
first ladys iq seems terribly low
was new mexico a state in 1500s
im all for securing the border but i will say this super heroes make super villians cartels have unlimited resources and will find a way through sinews of war are infinite money
change my mind about common core
the wall is literally just a joke tbh idc if they build it or not its just a joke anyways 
it amazes me how some of the people who come on these segments have a sheer inability to have a structured conversation and frequently change the subject and jump of topic
you got the yearlings cuz hispanics and latinos feel were under attack more than ever
i think the wall should be built and the border should have stronger protection if you are a real good citizen in your country and have no criminal record and that you can prove you dont i dont see why you shouldnt be able to relocate to another country legallyespecially if where you live is life threatening to you survival it shouldnt have to be years for it to become a citizen also as long as you pay your taxes and respect the laws
xray border some kind of electronic id tag random sensors spread around cities sounds extremely 1984ish
stevencrowder build the wall with your ass bitch
my boy shut the fuck up what are you even saying xray border dam props for trying i guess
lmao leroy is so damn stupid electronic id tags idk i need to sit down with some masterminds 
i think hes stoned i relate to his style of speaking like barely there and you keep dropping your cigarettes type of dude mary jane does this to my brain
omg  the spanish guy let everyone come in but make them citizens  this lack of logic is why america is on a downward spiral  it makes me want to smash my head on awaaaaalllll
leroy obviously hates his brown skin
another great change my man series
i got a change my mind ad on a change my mind video
this video sucked you yourself couldnt even back up your sources just threw some numbers without saying the source where it comes from or who does those studies how about put the links below on your sources where you get your info far as i know your argument is bs and just want to build the wall thats all glad i aint paying for your crappy video
sounds like leroy needs to watch less futuristic movies and to stay away from politics 
leroy is brown as fuck and says hes spanish and not mexican spain is in europe they are white people this guy is clearly not white
magical thinking from leroy  all the illegals will just happily make themselves known to the government so they can pay taxes  and everyone will be so happy with more government surveillance and tracking
lmao yeahhhh lets spray those illegal border crossers with xrays without lead vests
that guy was retarded
la raza la razahate these people so much smh
disabled man gets kicked in the balls for cutting his grass httpsyoutubexjle1mjtd94
do police brutality isnt real
lol crowder didnt even need to say anything that look at the end said it all
 sounds like the dude at the end talking about the wall  is 33 high on the drugs
this change my mind ep needs another shoot video is to short
i think the wall is a good idea but i dont want it to be so expensive we are on debt and we dont need something that is more costly
the woman who is more afraid of criminal illegals than the police is quite revealing  but not surprising
the not mexican with 500 years of mexican lineage is full of shit mexican shit
scientifical lmao
thats mexican dude lol your idea of random xray machines across the desert thats called a borderwall dont try running for governor please lol
this guy just said no borders but litterly described a border as the alternative answer
the world was created by godchange my mind
its not important thats why the wall will never be built
the first guy from new mexico basically proposed a hell on earth police state with the mark of the beast to buy and sell what a good
hey crowder where can i find your fact sheet for these discussions would love to use the same cited sources in some of my own debates and arguments
more people use tunnels so a wall would be useless
wtf that spanish dude sounds like hes describing the mark of the beast a giant xray machine on the entire boarder of mexico lmao brilliant plan 
that dude made me loose brain cells
got a steven crowder chang my mind ad on this video illusion 100
my brain melted after having to listen to that spanish guy he legit sounds like hes high
this is stupid he claims that some  immigrants dont want to pay taxes but its not like american citizens dont do that he is targeting and incriminating immigrants besides trump did state that immigrants where the ones bringing in drugs he can use the excuse that it was mis worded but if you think about it hes our president and if he cant even get his thoughts out of his mind why should he even be president much less why should we consider his idea about building a wall and if we are getting into statistics statistically wise most immigrants dont even cross through the border its through airplanes and visas building a wall would be stupid and a waste of money
i wont say i know everything and my opinion is correct because it may not be but in my eyes you should just train more border guards you dont exactly have that many and its a good idea to fund them
his solution for illegal immigrants    is to have them enter legally   
scientifical
theyre not sending their best folks
i am your dad change my mind
my dude wears checkered vans
autistic shill
what you do is remove the federalstate income taxes across the board and increase taxes on cost of goods sold to compensate now everyone pays a fair share and can determine whenhow they savespend their money etc entertainment for example needs to be taxed higher why are we taxing income instead of wasteful products conveniences time wasting services etc our country was founded by immigrants leaving a tyrannous government we should never close our borders we should never prevent people from entering our country we need to make citizenship a lot easier to obtain etc period
coming in hott
bless her heart she is asking for help from steven  i hope she gets help to deport this illegal criminals
this isnt fair the people he interviews r usually retarded
thats so sad fake victimhood actually creating victims
this dude is a fuckin idiothe must be high lolfuture governor of new mexico
xray scanner
did he just propose science fiction to solve the immigration crisis
did he just propose science fiction to solve the immigration crisis
there already is a wall   live in tijuana  shits impossible to jump
steven heres your problem your very good at your  statistical research your smart dont get me wrong but your a bit in the box your not allowing your mind to wander outside the box to realzie that although it may be currently true that immigrants are commuting crime etc being blunt for youtube comment sake lol the true reason they are commuting crime the influence they had that led to their crime is from a system created and lead by the rich and peivligged i think that a lot of the more leaning left people you talk to have trouble getting out there emotional and abstract ways of looking at society but i think you need to try and do that be more responsible and try changing your own mind just for the fun of it see what happens  i dont think youre a bad person but i definitely think youre close minded and dont realize that a lot of the crime and negative aspects of our society is actually due to the fact of segregation and rich and privileged patterns through our country  i would love to meet up and talk about this one day
the wall is a waste of tax dollars as is welfare
you need to be careful doing these things  some people are crazy af
hes talking to simpletons big deal
im against the wall for environmental reasons  a lot of animals mostly mammals need to migrate through that space to breed and survive
x ray border  i wanna be the governor of new mexico good god
what the fuck was that guy talking about an xray gate does he not realize how fucking expensive that would be
i feel like these videos just end up being loud people wanting to spout their nonsense at a camera with no actual intention to change any minds its always just feels and no reals im not sure if you ever annouce that youre showing up somewhere to do these but if people had time to collect data and bring it to the table with a well formulated argument then it might work out better i guess the problem with that though is assholes will organize to shut you down if they know in advance
i just feel sorry for that first guy tbh
stop the illegal border crossings with our military right now as in yesterday  build the wall
i like that first guys enthusiasm and scientifical ideas but i think eventually hell circle back around to the wall or something similar
lol
we live in idocracy today mike judge can see the future and its not to bright
dude is annoying
why i am not surprised that when the no wall people are asked  well how would you manage immigration they mostly shrug their shoulders and say you cant manage immigration bitch every nation on earth has immigration and immigration policies yet magically its only the us southern border that is unmanageable and racist to have a wall or physical impedimentalso wtf was that shit when he said that citizen dealers are the problem in drug trafficking as opposed to the mules those who bring it across the border cut off the supply and then what would they be selling
spanish guy plays a lot of games or watches a lot of movies
this dude could not stick to one point to save his life doesnt even know what hes trying to argue
cant wait for this guy to be governor
woooow dude is so lost
why is the argument they are hard working peoplehow does being a hard worker equate to breaking the law can i use that if i steal my neighbors tv and get caught but im a hard worker
this second person so stupid
people are insane to think america can support all the immigrants that come here its insane it will collapse the economy
let me know where and when i can sit down with you because i would love to shut down your silly arguments from the wall to the debate about genders tohell i could probably shut you down on your favorite ice cream flavor youre really not that bright steve
xray boarder and scientific gate brilliant i also love your widen blank stare after leroy
so in 5 years well be teleporting around the world for free usa cant take in a whole country legal or not theres no argument usa have to build the wall
the one overriding feature of this debate is how ill informed the people arguing against border security are in fact id go so far as to say that they are pretty poorly educated in general not that this should be a surprise the whole premise of leftism is that of elites lying to the proles to generate resentment with which to intimidate their political foes
does anyone have the sources to crowders statistics regarding homicide rate 37 violent crime rate 13 and drug trafficking rate 6070
i fucking died when the first lady asked how she can report those people all secretive like
no one should accept refugees its treating the symptoms not the illness devote the resources to bettering the lives of people in need where they want to live
what
i want to kill half of the universe change my mind
i am mexican and i am 100 for border security and deportation of criminals but honestly the two individuals who were interviewed were very hard to understand their position on the subject
latins or whatever
the 2nd guy was stupid as shit lol
that guys a flipping idiot gonna track people crossing borders without ever making them check in and he values money over safety it doesnt get much stupider than that
haha an xray border
here is a thought make the process to gain legal citizenship easier than it is to illegally come to the us current method to gain citizenship is total bs
tbh i dont really care if they build a wall like it wont do shit lmao
you should have blurred her entire body tbh because she could still be identified
we cannot afford to keep taxing  us citizens to pay for the illegal immigrant population btw most of the border has a barrier but its cheap and penetrable trump should have said reinforce or rebuild the wallleroy i hope when you see this you realize how idiotic you sounded
wow lets electronically tag everyone that sounds less draconian than a wallhmmmmmm
guy number two is a classic liberal who thinks hes well informed
he did say theyre bringing drugs
there you go come to the table with problems but zero solutions or ridiculous solutions that make zero sense that guy was all over the place and made zero points governor of nm not likely he cant formulate a proper thought
i believe the people you interviewed were incompetent and had no sense of what they were talking about
i lost so many brain cells watching this
well isnt there more important things to do in this country like bringing down criminals than paying for a useless wall that mexicans will always find a way to come in to this country do you even know how much money the cartel spends so their drugs come into the usa i think the real problem here is legalize drugs with moderated quantities that way also kids cant access it and you leave those fuckers put of business does that make sense
was this filmed in san jose california i recognize those pay to ride scooters with bird on it the street san carlos and bird is the street
please please please come to bakersfield california and do this segment id love to prove that youve taken a marxist stance on this issue
can you cite the sources for the statistics you were using
love the walther shirt keep up the great content on this channel thanks
that dude is dumb as shit 
i applaud steven for maintaining his composure through this guys rant considering he was in the presence of a real life meme tip of the beanie to you sir
my family has been here since 1550 prove it liar and speaks extremely poor english damn
lol the first guys plan  make them all citizens and tax them cool story we agreebut they have to go through the process that is in place the amount of thought some of the idiots put into hypothetical policy is hilarious
was stephen paddock a illegal immigrant where is he getting his statistics ppl
illegal immigration is against the law technically but i dont think it will resolve any issues the reason the wall bothers me is because the people who want to build it arent really concerned with the issues they present its just the blame card
change my mind they can fly dig or swim over
that guy in white was high af pass whatever he smoking
i just saw an add with crowder in it on this video
lol at the first guy w t f
the guy was hilarious doesnt know how things work and just talking senseless stuff just make them legal and tax them lost it at some kind of electronic id tag of  uhhh some sorthow do you check that without a border control  uhh i dont knowxray scanner which gets your number this guy clearly watched too many scifi movieswas that really the best conversation you had d
wait if illegal immigrants commit 37 of murders and black ppl commit 51 then ur telling me that white ppl only commit 12  hows that possible
i would love to be on this one anyways this guy couldnt gather his thoughts together made me want to smack him to to to to today junior
xray wall huh welcome to the united states of america you now have cancer lmao
do people not realize theres already a wall there we have borders already and there are specific areas where you leave and enter one country to another when trump says build the wall he means to increase the security around the already existing wall to prevent illegals from coming through
we build the walls not because we hate people outside but because we love and protect people inside
1130 you almost lost it rationalizing his ideas
steven are you aware of your change my mind meme cuz if not i suggest you check it out cuz with respect to you some of them are really funny
deep down they all just want the usa to be more brown
my dad harambe is alive change my mind 
this guy is retarded dont build a wall build an xray gate if he becomes governor of new mexico then i dont even know
show me a 100 m wall and i ll show a 101 m ladder do you seriously think a bigger wall is going to stop it  you have no idea what immigrants have to go through to get there you never will if they do build it who do you think is going to build it you dumbfucked bitch fucking build it build it youself smart ass and then watch it fail your ideology is not this or that youre just fucking depressed and angry with yourself i respect a lot of your views but i can see now youre just a dick head for the sake of being a dick head you must be looking forward to get fucked up daddy didnt beat hard enough go do this at the border while you build get fucking shot bitchbetter yet come over here spew your bullshit in mexico cunt
yeah solid walls are so yesterday we could just have a death ray that shines on the border now that would be next level
probably the dumbest person ive ever heard speak was the gentlemen with the white shirt smh
do you ever start to interview someone and just a few seconds in realize they have no clue what is going on because thats what happened here 
i like this concept but after watching a multitude of your videosyoure essentially a poster boy for rightwing ideology with the same exact talking points i do agree with very few topics but your arguments used in support are 90 nothing but critiquing the discrepancies in dialogue of the opposition rather than providing a direct rebuttal
anyone who comes legally should be granted citizens what if they have no education and skills how do you tax that who will pay for them to get qualifications
the guy he interviewed is another person living in a globalist fantasy world they came into the country illegally aka they are not interested in taking any tests for citizenship
build the wall change my mind crowder youre canadian man
this guy with his xray border did a sound job of publicly humiliating himself
i think id agree with a lot with crowder about most issues like having secure borders except building the wall im an avid outdoorsman i hunt i fish and im an environmental conservationist i believe in secure borders but the wall is going to damage so much natural landscape and for animals the border along the rio grande is their only way to get water i think upping border security would be more effective these people that cross over illegally are gunna find more unconventional methods of crossing i believe that upping border security will incentivize people to not smuggle where theres heavy security and if the whole border has security we can expect smuggling operations to get busted more frequently while also create safer places for cities and towns along the border some of these peoples lives depend on finding a new home or smuggling drugs and wall isnt going to scare these people off theyll keep trying till they have a ladder to clime or break a hole though it these are just what ifs but its what i believe
go build it like i give a shit what dumb americans do with their money where there is a will there is a way a walls wont keep people from enterering the usa
is it really the best use of money  is that the best way to enforce immigration laws i dont trust the government spending on anything but surely there are more high tech ways to protect the borders its almost the lazy way to try  fix the issue we are supposed to be the most wealthy  advanced country in the world  a wall is the best thing we can come up with i think we can do better
i got a crowder ad before this video
if i requested that you tear down the walls to your house but leave all of your property and family members inside and allow anyone to walk through your living space would you be like yeah that sounds like an awesome ideanowhy not
i dont get how can people be so dumb
then filthy mexicans with their tacos and burritos and menudo damn now im hungry
why does leroy try so hard to make himself look smart
the wall wont do crap lmao
lol wow that guy ruled hard  someone who actually has a plan to get involved in politics instead of just sitting on camera trying to convince normal people about things hes researched the shit out of steven you said very little during that chat that had any kind of merit theres zero chance youd win this debate with anyone researched as youre defending a position of a grand total of 1 outcome build a physical wall which is essentially saying its the best and only currently viable solution which would be a very hard sell even if it were true his idea of a laser xray wall is equally as silly as your physical wall one the solution is clearly not that simple and will need to be a combination of things to ensure people follow the rules and set process
the face at the end lol
but how would you have a xray wall if there is no wall at all
steven we shouldnt build the wall we conquer mexico take over there damn country think about it all their people want to be american and are to poor to even farm make them all americans and put them to work like they want to
a couple things on illegal immigration for one illegal immigrants do not commit more crime than anyone else according to the most recent statistics there is no signs showing that illegal immigrants create a dispraportionate amount of crime and in fact when arrested its usually for a much less worse crime secondly the idea of an actual border wall is pretty ridiculous estimates have put it at 70 billion dollars to build as well as 150 million dollars to maintain a cost that is ridiculous considering that the success of a border wall in keeping out criminals is questionable at best but last of all illegal immigrants benefit this nation illegal immigrants pay billions of dollars in taxes every year but never actually see any of those benefits for themselves like medicare or medicaid which means that they are just paying american citizens so they can live thier own lifestyles overall while legal immigration is preferable all evidence shows that a wall is absolutely not the solution
class act steven letting the dude get his points across knowing he was playing checkers in a chess game mentally
this is the best people you could get youre talking to people with the mental capacity of 6th graders youre getting bad crouder i mean if thats all you could get then fine but jesus that was painful to watch it makes you look dumb as well im for building the wall and could have put up a better argument not to build it
100 of illegal immigrants are criminals lol
stevens i think you are actively selecting who to be put in or out of the footage to make your argument seems solid while its still extremely weak in this video
507 im not mexican  your accent says otherwise hombre
idgaf i the us wants to build a wall but we mexicans wont pay for that stupid shit if i ever encounter some racist people ill beat the shit out of them idc
once borders are gone that means one government one rule and were all fucked cmon people
scientifical
change my mind conclusions  a majority of americans are not intelligent  the dumb ones like to argue the most about being wrong  statistics and facts scare people
i just think the wall is going to be a waste of taxpayer money
i can usually watch these all the way trough but that last guy was really rambling had to skip it keep it up guys
i wall a would cost more than its worth i hear most illegal immigrants fly in and just dont fly back again a wall costs a shit load but the reward isnt the best im not the answers man but im sure there is a better way
that woman should have been a little more blurred and voice changed if she was subdued into fearing the illegals this lady probably went back home and was killed if i had a line up of women i could pick her out of that line up think about the people who actually know her and her voice
xray gate for people to pass through and this gate would be attached toa  wall perhaps
well to be perfectly honest in my humble opinion of course without offending anyone who thinks differently from my point of view but also looking into this matter in a different perspective and without being condemning of ones view and trying to make it objectified and by considering each and everyones valid opinion i honestly believe that i completely forgot what i was going to say
leeroy i dont know the proper scientificalray border trio
i dont get it xray walls are you tagging hundreds of millions of people in united states how much of money gonna be poured there
at the end of the day this whole situation is sad my parents were both illegal immigrants and did what they did to give me and my siblings a better life and for that im forever thankful because i wouldnt be where i am today theres just a lot of bad people that come to the us for another purpose and thats what makes the rest look bad
we need to get fluoride out of the water
guys the wall isnt for the mexicans its to keep us in when martial law is activated they want to prevent us from being able to leave when the shit hits the fan
xray or id tags all that is still a wall
good fear mongering by steven crowder hey how much did you pay that lady
0854   borders will become a thing of the past  and the same runon sentence the interviewee wants the us a country with its own borders to give citizenship to illegal aliens and tax them  there is a contradiction in terms here hmmm i wonder if the interviewee will eventually figure it out while describing some futuristic border control system with xrays and frickin lasers along the border but border should not exist
this spanish guy is a fucking retard
i think we should tag people like cattle after putting them through xray machines after they hand write a note saying why they want to come to the us because i want to be governor of sante fe nm and pharmaceutical companies pour billions of dollars into flooding the streets with opioids change my mind
the fact that you think building a wall is a appropriate as if to claim that america belongs to you and you should keep everyone else out is wrong if you recall your own history that country does not belong to you your british ancestors came and took it from the native indians that the country rightly so belonged to you killed them raped their women and children and you glorified it in your cowboy films and reclaimed the country as your own now you think you can build a wall from the very people that that country once belonged to just goes to show what bunch of greedy lying hypocrites that you and your president are doesnt that your from canada still a british colony how do you think your ancestors got to america and canada did they get there legally yes there was no laws at that time but if the very ideas and todays laws your proposing now existed then then you would be the illegal immigrants and a wall would be built against you

what a fuckin meathead i hope that guy doesnt breed your face at the end of this vid is priceless
literally the only topic i disagree with crowder on
digital tags seems like a horrible degrading idea
bro been waiting on this for a long long time gotta cover this one again 1 up north 1 out west  1 down south it would be a even wider social experiment
xray scanner huh
the second person really has no damn clue make them citizens and tax them they will just work underground and dont claim anything the guy has no clue how immigration works but yet has a lot of input about how to solve it
building a wall keeps people out but also keeps people in
blurs face but doesnt blur nametag with face and name
mine fields are cheaper and more effective
so what i get from this is that illegals automatically become citizens as they cross this xray border just by having an excuse in the meantime my wife married me a citizen waited two years of paperwork so that she could come here from south america then she had to wait a year to get a green card and then finally wait three more years to qualify for citizenship all while paying a fuck load of money each time yeah fuck that dude his idea is completely off the fucking wall
mexico has had a southern border wall to keep out poor guatemalans  try crossing into mexico undocumented and see how quickly they jail you
all these mexicans talking trying to make an excuse as to why they are not mexican lol like bitch you cant even talk right talking bout your family been here since the 50s lol i speak better english then that weakazz dude
cheap prick here checking in 
ive seen a bunch of videos of people talking about immigration and it seems clear to me that the majority of people against the wall deportation ice etc need to be informed on the difference between an illegal immigrant and a legal immigrant because 95 of them dont know the difference hell most of them think they are the same thing
dumb guy everything he suggested to steven requires a physical checkpoint and points to funnel through he seriously did not realize that in a roundabout way he said build a wall
the wall is a terribly inefficient addition to the current security layers at the border its a waste of money we can secure the border with technology the wall costs 25 billion dollars initially would require the government to take land from american citizens and it will cost billions to maintain thousands of miles of concrete trump did in fact say that the people crossing the border are not good people and that they bring crime and drugs also first and second generation immigrants commit less crime on average than citizens who have lived here for generations
steven i am sure your team has already concluded this but his topic needs a second try
i love what youre doing but i dont think you should have kept the ice part in there if someone watched video and saw that that may have been apart of the money laundering they may launch attacks on her
this is probably the dumbest thing ive ever heard an xray border
i believe people should come here legally and there should be border policy but the wall is a huge waste of money
did he say borders are a thing of the past what also how much is estimated the wall will cost thats just the only concern i have
hmbillions of us tax dollar spending thwarted by a simple 21 purchase on amazon   i think amazon ships to juarez i might have to research that onehttpaco6xq30mn free shipping with amazon prime btw
what percentage of illegal immigrants commits crimes try 100 theyre here illegally
sorry im kinda confused does he actually believe in this or is this more satire
dude you should have blurred her id card hanging from her neck
stevencrowder i would alter that ladies voice too for her safety you dont know who these people could be
the second guy was completely incoherent
that zoom in the end i love it
511  im not mexican im spanish my familys been in new mexico since around the 1550s right around there
i just lost brain cells watching this man that sat with him
why does she have a plant in a bottle
fuck yes this vid was great good job keep up the work
it sounds like he wants the implanted mark of the beast to facilitate government enforcement over our lives nice
didnt realize there was so many people who have absolutely no common sense whatsoever   send the message that illegal immigrants will not be given free handouts and then a good majority of them will not show up at the border  simple fix   and build the wall too  fast wwg1wga  qanon
this guy on crack
except that a brain washed phag cucks mind is unchangeable
bitcoin will become a global currency in 20 years change my mind
man that was kind of a letdown please do this againsomewhere with potential for more intelligent participants
im in okinawa japan but i really wish i could have sit down and speak on this subject the guests who took the time to speak did not do the subject justice i could write a paper on this subject if i had a place to send it i would appreciate an opportunity to voice my own opinion on why the wall shouldnt be built that being said i love these videos and wish i could have been in any of them to have an intellectual debate on such great third railing subjects keep up the good work 
waste of money
crowder love your show but seriously where the fuck did you get those statistics
that guy is an idiot im sorry but an xray wallwtf
when you let people come illegal it is an insult and disrespect to people who obey the laws and come legally
we might find some areas where we disagree versus areas where we disagree  nice one crowder
the second guy was literally brainwashed to just think wallbad even tho all his views basically aligned with having a wall
i got an ad for a change my mind video on this video gg youtube
thats second guy wants a new world order he so stuck in the future but yet doesnt understand how you get to this so called future lol  he needs to meet with a group of masterminds
if hes from canada why does he even care about whats going on in the us tf
first time watcherand you call me a cheap prick at the endsorry for watchingwont happen againpromise
is this woman walking around with a branch in a plastic bottle
i wouldve had to of let him know just how stupid he sounded i cant deal with that kind of stupidity
why do you dare people to change your mind when you know damn well you wont change your mind also great sticking to republican talking points and just throwing red herrings everywhere this dude is pathetic
i think that the wall is a total waste of money i am all for protecting our borders i think what we really need to focus is making the immigration system more reliable the immigration judges have just a few minutes to decide weather to deport people a thing i am also shocked about is that illegal immigrants dont have right to lawyer if they cant afford one we need to focus on giving immigrants a chance to represent themselves before they get deported not a multi billion dollar wall that wont work
america needs to take over mexico problem solved
who the fuck these guys cant even form coherent sentences let alone debate i believe in no borders hurr durr a wall means no immigration at allwhat the flying fuck
constant drone surveillance of the border would probably be cheaper and more effective whether you use a wall or a drone patrol you would need border patrol spaced to intervene if people tried to get through so thats not much of a distinguishing factorwhatever we do please dont make me choose between breaking the law and getting an implanted id that is some crazy authoritarian stuff for that guy to be throwing down
how did you keep from laughing at scifi boy xray scanners and electronic tags
tax them so steal from them
suggestion for these talks would it be useful to hand out a few terms vocabulary to save some leadin time for your conversations as a comms consultant in companies and orgs who find this useful before objectives and panning sessions i am always praying for your safety as you do this work to tell people the facts of theses topics
hes going to look at his video and just be embarrassed 
why not do it like denmark where you need a cpr numberssn equivalent to do literally anything and they make temporary ones for immigrants just to have them documented we dont utilize how necessary we can make having a ssn be
come onnnnnnnnn  at least have a debate with a nonmoron
governor of new mexico  what a bender 
trump did say mexicans r drug dealers what the hell is steven on about
a free thought   he is wrecked  no solutions what so ever  how about a space force
i want to be gorvenor says the man who is done nothing but make outlandish statements wants xray borders for doesnt want a wall how does he propose the criminals adhere to this system of his lol
dude that comes in talking about drug issues offers up an idea youd have to be high to think of
507 guy is a joke   i d i o t
507 dude was low key sorta high key excited to be in crowders presence 
fucking leroy is a nazi fucking wants people tracked like the jews with their tattooed numbers
that dude was meth out kept stickin his tongue out 
a lot to say many valid points that can counter this
did you just call your youtube viewers either poor or cheap pricks
your mom gay
no one wants to sit down because the topic of the wall os stupid and your mind cant be changed if you are on that level the thing is you dont believe in the wall you say mean more of an imigration reform and stuff then why not put that why say build the wall clickbait   but your clickbait didnt work cuz no one sat down because the wall is stupid a fisical wall thats stupid and you are stupid crowder because you dont believe in the fisical wall either fail
that guy sounds like zoolander
the problem is that latino immigrants are not even at the very least contributing to our society monetarily 50 of latinos are on welfare the illegal ones still get welfare through their naturalized children also their children go to our schools for free at a cost of 5000 a year per head to taxpayers also these people do not get insurance so often as not when you get in a crash with a latino your car isnt getting fixed why do we need them why should we take them we are current day america our lands are filled up we want the best and brightest or none at all
crowder is an idiot sometimes the wall is stupid its a symbol that cost a lot that same money can be used in a different way than a wall to stop ilegal immigration
i dont know what the solution is but the wall is tacky as fuck something that will be torn down eventually there must be a better solution
damn you should have blurred that lady out entirely
35 of the population being illegal immigrants committing a whopping 37 of all homicides without a reference sounds like complete horse shit i googled trying to find this stat and havent found anything close to the figure you stated please try and reference stats like that that are increadibly important to the arguement
dude might be high on meth sounds like it just keeps talking
theres underground tunnels that immigrants cross over to the states they also come over on ships and through canada how about giving a huge fine for anyone hiring illegal immigrants by the way mexicans arent the only illegals in usa
900k views in about one to two days and not on the trending list
seems to be a growing feeling  among some people that we need no borders we need no countries a world of free happythis is silly  do you leave your electronic devices laying around in public do you lock your car and house doors  maybe people will just voluntarily pay what they consider their fair share of taxes  does any group of humans such as governments have more or less corruption and problems as it gets bigger  silly rabbits
im taking 2 hot mexican females lmk
fuck the wall just get rid of all welfare programs across the board no social security whatsoever i bet most of the immigrants would leave and no foreigners want to come in unless theyre willing to work
that mexican lad was clueless people like him who will have our last right snatched away
that was a waste of a video that second guy was a freaking idiot
most people cross borders while hiding in hidden compartments of vehicles not by foot and theres already border control for that the wall wouldnt change a thing
1045 bro youre describing a boarder checkpoint
i just came here looking for xray border comments
communism goal no borders one nation make people as one with no culture control them all
a wall wont do a thing
illegals are majority lazy
islam isnt a religion change my mind
doesnt believe in borders or checkpoints believes in microchipping everyone so you know where everyone is when they cross the border at a magical xray checkpoint liberal logic 101
reads the title oh no
the wall is a joke it wont happenwho knew so called conservatives would be chanting for the government to save them and support more government workers border petrol at a time when government retirements might be taking in more than socialist security in the futurealso people supporting everify which is nothing more than government verify seriously government approved workers wtfthe government is not going to save you from itself and it is not the illegals giving welfare to the people getting them dependent on government spending our treasury into the ground  enforcing unconstitutional laws it is the federal government  this illegal immigrant non issue is a divide  conquer strategy that gets people eyes  ears away from the real threat to our nation federal governmentso called conservatives now a days support big government like more spending more government workers eminent domain and we have a president that praised socialist healthcare before during  after the election and who is pushing gun control trump who knew this would happen
blur out her nametag as well  she could get killed
that was a pretty antileft ad with ben shapiro for an unbiased change my mind segment its almost like one of those liberal fake news bubbles yall talk about so much
i see the guy was making a video or streaming i wonder if you put his video up because everything he said sounded extremely ignorant
chicago is one small example of how illegals affect black areasbaking factory found to have hired 800 illegals once they were gone 800 jobs opened up guess who got those jobs
for a dude who invested last 3 years of his life to sort this problem he knows pretty much nothing about this kind pf problem me as a forin observer i thing america definitely should rework its imigration policy and build a wall as a gesture
ok steve look i love your content but this wall is a joke did you know illegal immigration is at an all time low for the usa also most illegal immigrants come by plane so whats a wall going to do my stats come from a very trusted show called adam ruins everything who has been fact checked several times
great video
 we dont need to build a wall because now we can tax them if they come into the countryhow the fuck are we going to tax them if they come illegally because we have no wall you stupid ignorant moronthese people are incredibly retarded and it is shocking such a large part of american that are capable of voting are so incredibly misinformed and ignorant and have no desire to learn the truth at all unfortunately
freedom of thought we need barcodes and tagge them and then xrays scientificalise them be more free flowingggg mannnnn free drugggsee for new mexico
that dude thinks hes gonna be governorwere in trouble
stevencrowder what do you think of this peter fonda situation involving his remarks about kidnaping baron trump and with twitter not shutting him down on his threats
hes spaniard cause his family been there since 1550s stupidest claim in the world the aztec face never lies bro
im surprised no one says no to the wall because of the cost or the fact they can fly over or tunnel under tighten the border but where it matters walls gunna be pointless
that guy smokes some good stuff
leroy had no facts used nothing but vagueopinionated comments and rambled through all of these opinions while repeating most many times  if he had a point it was lost
pray for new mexico
he can be the governor of his moms basementahhh yep
i dont profit of triggering people change my mind
849 brain dead idiot
the bad thing about the wall is itll do a whooooole lotta nothing for a whooooole lotta money
i agree with border reform obviously you have to have borders thats fair but a wall is just a symbol and it has demonstrably been proven that a wall wouldnt prevent illegal immigration anymore  its basically just a symbol just my opinion
the problem i have with using ststistics and the literature is that it is controlled by those who write it i have seen too many skewed numbers in this society its sad to see how so many people say they are legal citizens and they are following the laws but fail to realize that they are not following the laws illegals dont pay taxesthats ignorance because every time someone buys food gas clothing  or whatever  guess what they pay taxes some may want to try to argue they dont pay labor taxes again ignorance because theres actually no laws that says you have to pay labor taxesin fact its illegal hmmm
it was super racist of leroy to imply that his blood is pure spanish if his family really was from spain they were part of the slave owner class in new mexico
he finds the dumbest people maybe they are the only ones willing but damn like they can barely create a sentence let alone a persuasive argument
on gender and abortion there are people trying to make changes that you oppose in this case you are proposing that the wall be built to some extent i think the onus is on you to justify it i think most people see it as a perfectly normal security fixture or a thing that we never needed and will not need theres no in between i think the strength of this series is showing the inbetween and the nuances of the topic this video didnt show that i dont think its ok to just pick a side thoughtlessly and then blame the other for not having put in much thought please try again and try to find more people that can have an informed and nuanced discussion
lol steve a bitch for the last part they guy was actually saying some heavy true shit at the end about the pharmaceuticals being the big business pushing harmfuladdicting drugs to the people steve cut him off lol not surprised at this point of trump supporters now man
put that stand up in san antonio on the westside and see how fast your ass gets beat
id have to get a few mastermind individualscrowder where are you finding these people lol
you should have edited this out blurring her face is not going to keep them from knowing who she is
everyone on the left is just fine with corruption just as long as it benefits them
what area was it seemed kinda empty what was up werent you allowed or didnt you had the balls to do this episode on a college campus
most of these people have extremely low intelligence
next islam is not a religion of peace
lesson leftists are ignorant racist fucking losers dont waste your breath talking to them
the reason no one sat is because we all know we need the wall and the two people that did sit im willing to bet my life they both were not citizens they couldnt even form proper sentences and both actually agreed we need immigration control
i lost brain cells listening to that guy
wow steven way to fly the coup walls really when have walls served a free society
pee is stored in the balls  change my mind
an xray gate  lmao this guy
not sure how you kept a straight face while listening to leroy
not gay jared wearing a fanny pack  must be conceal carrying in that bad boy 
lmao the office moment at the end
lets settle this lets make illegal immigration illegal
leroy is kinda stupid
please blurr the lady a bit more
this dude has to be on somethin
stevens face at the end of the video says it all
i say the wall wont stop problem it would more in fact cause because if they are saying that immigrants dont want to pay taxes and the wall will just put us more in debt which will be payed by the taxpayers which will cause an increase in taxes not only most of our country all ready lives in poverty so that will cause the economy it self go down also not that many immigrants cross by the border in fact many studies show that most immigrants come to the united states by airplanes and just overstaying there visa so there nothing but negativity that can come from that wall being built hopefully you read my message and it will give you something to consider then just to say build the wall
statistically they are illegal so choot um a little bit
jesus that guy is off
was that guy when he sat down next to crowder
well i live around a lot of seasonal workers and ive actually overheard them asking cashiers for tax exemption the others grumble that their levi swim trunks are taxed they do not want to put back in thats an absolute crock of shit pulled out of asses to portray they want to assimilate they dont they are here for money and nothing else they hate us and it shows fuck them
he was a prime example of where a persons confidence is much higher than their intelligence at least have an idea of what you want to say and actually have a point to put across instead of just waffling on like a moron about something your clearly not knowledgable about
jesus he was all over the shop
the main issue is illegal immigrants to many not enough resources or money to vet them all and who is going to pay for this the tax payer  yes i feel bad for those people who were born in shhole places that are corrupt and they want better for themselves and for their children but at least have a skill to contribute along with coming in legally  others who come in legally and become citizens have to go through the process why shouldnt these illegal immigrants  we have enough homeless and illegals that we cant support because we never anticipated this flow of people  we need to fix our country first then help others  we the us try to fix everything for everyone in other countries while our veterans and other legal citizens get hung out to dry we cant help others until we fix internally first  the guy speaking to crowder i wonder what he does for a living because he isnt even remotely smart has no concept or intelligent solution for this serious issue we are facing right now  an xray fence if people are so bent out of shape for the cost of the new wall then what will the cost be for this type of wall technology needs to be used sure but sometimes simple is better
wall wont matter  drug  will blast holes through over under or around that wall  all it will do is create a few jobs
these guys were too stupid stephen
i got an easy solution instead of wasting my money on a wall lets fine the companies paying shit wages for illegal immigrants you cut off the food source you cut off the problem
and this is an prime  example of why they dont want the wall   most that dont apparently dont even know what a wall is  or what legal migration is
borders is borders back in the day rome will fight for its borders of the barbarians attackus will defend itself when zombies attack your back yard what would you do
so ive learned people against the wall are morons is this guy the one spanish whos family came in 1550s for real
wow steven you should know better than to argue with the mentally disabled please god dont let him become the governor of new mexico
people are gonna be able to cross the border with boats anyways wouldnt they they cant guard the wall over the entire border either and its gonna be expensive as fuck a waste of money if you ask me
lmfaooo an x ray scanner im 
the identification hes talking about is called a passport passports have chips in them nowwhat a dumb fuck
the proper scientifical ray
he seems jacked up on some mountain dew
eeeshyou got the bottom of the barrel on this one steve
governor of new mexico
x ray borderour tech aint black ops 3 cmon now
this spanish guy is dumb af
statistically 100 of illegal immigrants are criminals  thats what illegal immigration is a crime
1100 cant have a gate without a wall dumbass
the wall wouldnt work because most illegals are from overstaying their visas
 gunsatthebordernow border agents shoot to kill no fence is needed after the first few kills they wont be trying it again i promise
wow i got a add for you last change my mind and it confused me at first
i wont change your mind but i want that wall to be in my car and full of subwoofers 
this fucking kidomg so can americans waltz into mexico and say  im here  make me a mexican citizen now because im on your soil
im mexican but i do believe immigrants are being treated is a un rational way i feel like immigrants with a harsh criminal record within the last 47 years should be deported in the aspect of drug trafficking shooting and crimes that have in danger other people life i also believe that the country should be more accepting and open mind on their views of immigrants give them the opportunity to become citizens and also have equal rights anyone who doesnt obey the law shouldnt be treated the same way same law enforcement and anyone who doesnt obey with it shouldnt be allowed in this country as harsh as that sounds it the truth if you are not here to be one with the community and one help yourself and the only way your are doing it is illegal in some sort of way  why are you going to come and fuck it up for the rest of us
the second guy as passionate as he was was just very naive to how the boarder works
ive got an idea how about we build a wall around all the shit countries 
the market wants conversations and crowder delivers freemarket
i have to say it that spanish dude is retardedsomehow i think this guy is an illegal himself and that might be just the reason why he wants to enforce citizenships for felons and yes illegal border crossing is a serious crime that can legally end up with you getting shot
good luck to the future of new mexico with this guy at the helm
judge rules in favor of rightwinger suing twitter for banning his accounthttpwwwinformationliberationcomid58562deanberryministrycom
that last guy was such an idiot
governor of new mexico keep dreaming lol
the guy in the white shirt is killing my brain cells
white people are immigrants
also was the future new mexico governor on cocaine just a wild guess
its illegal to come to america without documents and everyone know this yet immigrants act shock when they are caught and get separate and deported
when you figure out your xray border send us your website 
yeah the spain guy has his own vocabulary testahh pathahhh i need some masterminded individualsahh
go green global  lol what the hell was he smoking  lol so his family came from spain  funny but sad
and this is what were up against people so stupid its impossible to reason with them without a wall were doomed
illegal immigrants perpetrate 37 percent of the homicides in the us where did he get that number from
a wall wont do shit to keep them out waste of money building barriers that prevent rotation into and out of the country have historically increased the number of illegals in the country dumb shit
that boy has come up with the beast system keep an eye on him
in each year from 2007 to 2014 more people joined the ranks of the illegal by remaining in the united states after their temporary visitor permits expired than by creeping across the mexican border according to a report by researchers at the center for migration studies this was posted by the new york times and with a wall costing tax payers 210 billion and 150 million a year to maintain to me just seems a bit redundant also a lot of people with privet farms which their families have owned for many years would be forced to sell their land to the government for much less than a civilian sale of which they would not wish to do in the first place but would have no choice since the government has the right to take you land for market valueany time they wish  not to say the wall isnt a possible solution to a problem i just think that the cost is to great when the majority isnt entering that way it also will not keep the drugs from coming in the cartels have more than enough money to find other ways to get it across or just dig deeper tunnels that is my take on it 
when that idiocracy moment happens in real life xraywall
leroy was a fucking nutcase
ill tell you why we shouldnt build the wall 1 its a huge waste of money its not tall enough even the one we currently have now in some places isnt tall even if it was itd be as easy as getting a bigger ladder and a regular matters to guard from barbs so for it to be effective it would literally have to be massive and the cost would be unbelievable 2 the majority of illegal immigrants dont even come across the wallopen border they come through checkpoints but just use really admittedly intelligent and creative ways to sneak in also its as easy as coming in through a plane and overstayingnever leaving your papers such as a visathats if they can get them because the process is backed up years seriously though many dont even cross the border that way because its dangerous its mostly the very desperate with 0 cash that are getting away from something 3 the terrain makes it very difficult the build a wall there which actually makes it impossible to build a wall in some places even if they did use enginuity and come up with a way it would sure as hell be many times more expensive but it would be destroyed of natural causes in those areas in other words nature will beat the wall theres solid reasons without putting anything about all that immigrants could actually contribute to out economy which ik a majority of the idiots here will just shout fake news at and spit regurgitated blatant lies they heard from sources that only give them the partial news that they want hear and say anything otherwise is lies no matter how obvious or legitimate the information may be
i mean you dont need a whole wall but a sight line wouldnt hurt monitored with ai maybe to perfect the technology  monitor the border have some sections of wall
the guy fro 530 is not from spain his accent is not from spain and he looks like a mix with native american so hes from south america
is the wall to keep illegals put or us in
sharks sharks with laser beam xray vision on the boarder
id have to get a few like mastermind individuals to sit down and think this through wow good one dumbass
we will never get to the h1b visa issue our citizens cant understand basic immigration issues
guys make america great again with an x ray wall
literally the first thing that should be brought up is the reason not to build it is because it can be defeated with a ladder or shovel the very idea that a physical wall will stop this when you can just go over it or under it or even blow a hole through it with explosives is the dumbest thing ive ever heard if anyone says we can monitor thousands of miles accurately and efficiently allow me to also introduce you to the concept that our government has never been compitent at anything it does dont believe me go to the dmv for five minutes or watch a video of congress not to mention the expense of this nonsense fiasco plus this doesnt address the people that will come on legal visas and just stay which is much more of the problem than people hopping a wall or fence how does everyone also forget the thousands of miles of coast we have that is also not properly monitored for example the state of washington has so few state troopers patrolling its costal road that there have been numerous documentaries on it the idea that this will work in any fashion is ludicrous and foolish just like the xray wall created by this certified genius its just a stupid xenophobic nonsense campaign promise created to whip up the uneducated and get them to vote we can all agree that reforms and valid ideas for immigration need to take place however there so far have not been any valid plans put forth by any political leaders to achieve those goals yet and likely never will nobody is ever truly interested in solving problems only getting in to office and grabbing money and power or to serve their 1 masters or corporate overlords that keep them in their political positions instead of making videos exposing idiots and uneducated fools why dont you spend some of that time to construct an actual idea that will solve the problem and propose it using your platform oh wait thats because it doesnt make money or push your agenda the problem with this country isnt just liberals or right wing people its all the people playing both sides and enciting these idiots to begin with its literally all just a giant circle jerk of uneducated neuro surgeons running around trying to be dumber than each other and validating their own beliefs and biases opposed to considering the correct answers and compromising to find a middle ground that actually solves the problems we all face together and making it work
this guys vision of the future ten years from now is freaky
this guy is a bafoon
for anyone which likes the background music its pogo  boy and bear
i feel the wall should not be built the money put into building the wall could be instead put directly into ice or other ways to stop immigration the wall being built would be very hard to build because of the harsh terrain while also being 10 million feet long it all comes back to expense and how that money could be spent in other more effective ways to stop illegal immigration
the second guy does genuinely have a good idea with the open border but have a tag scanner thing he just didnt know how to put it into words he was meaning something like an infared scanner that penetrates a certain area and can scan a tag to know who and what is entering the country at certain times which honestly isnt bad at all i still support building a border though just to have an added line of defense because its really easy to defeat something like an infared scanner or something else that could grab a tag
heres a bright idea stop hiring illegal immigrants maybe they wont come to a country that requires legal citizens to work for them
goddamn there is no critical thought coming from this guy i lost iq points listening to him
wellp its settled folks we dont need a big ol mean lookin concrete wall no that would be a waste of money but what we need to do is tag every immigrant with a chip like an animal and build a massive technologically advanced scannerfence to keep count on how many tagged immigrants come overproblem is it still doesnt keep track of illegals who are not documented nor does it stop anyone from bringing any drugs or weapons across the border furthermore no citizen of either country should be able to just waltz on over the border just because you have citizenship duel or otherwise if i want to go to mexico i still have to go through a port of entry and present my passport card i cant simply cross over in the middle of the sonoran desert
i feel less smart after listening to this guy with low camera battery
1107 or maybe like we could like just build a really long moatah get some space lasersah like and then some sharks and maybe like attach the lasersah to the sharks frikin heads ya know
deport them both plz
if youre worried about taxes not being paid first make sure every citizen is paying them i know too many citizens that dont be paying taxes while my mother a resident is paying  if becoming a citizen was easier everyone would fucking do it
steven crowder is retard change my mind  ill use his lying about how that guy punched him for no reason as my first rebuttal
what is that guy smoking lol
cheetos are just weird doritos change my mind
just like a democrat to want to tax and track a person based on their race
you dont need a physical wall dude just some like some xray sensory beams projected to and from space duh
id feel a lot better knowing my tax dollars were going towards building a wall rather than towards illegals here mooching off of our economy
build walls we gon prolly dig holes
most of peoples excuses against the wall that ive heard are what about the honest hard working people that want to come here and then i ask if they are honest and hard working then why dont they just come legally and they usually reply with something like the process takes to long etc etc and i understand that so wouldnt a good solution to this problem be to speed up the immigration process get the honest and hard working people here legally and conveniently so there is no excuse to come illegally i feel like that and a wall would be effective to not hurting the honest people but keeping out the bad ones and dont ask me well how could we make the process easier and faster blah blah blah because i personally dont know the full process and dont have a full solution to the proposal its just a thought
steven crowders legs look like cheese sticks  chang my mind
these were the dumbest people to ever participate
shrek royale will now have battle royale
hows this dud saying hisbeen here since the1500s but his english sounds like shit   chicanos for trump
the second guy is an idiot
not gonna lie a fucking xray border would be badassshame about the cost
tbh i wouldve loved if all countries around the world open their boarders and free their citizens a citizen of the world should be able to reside any where in the world without having to applying for an application first and also it would be great distribute natural resources to all those in need  and we may never be at wars again be one big family and live the life of dream
f meth head latina want to be reporter
yeah we uh we tax themhow the hell do you tax an illegalundocumented immigrant
like nigga how does one have the brain cells to say xray wall im lost and ive yet to find myself
you know what would be a good topic for the change my mind segment everyone is a hypocrite
im dating a half puertorican half mexican guy whos mom is from mexico but is legal through marriage to his puertorican dad i was really surprised that both of them feel the same way as this mexican american lady they are against the illegal mexicans here and want them to be deported because they know how they are i think most legal mexicans who really want to be a part of this country feel this way which to me speaks volumes
that poor ladys life is at risk shouldnt put her on camera asshole
my head hurts listening to this guy
the fact that you blurred out her face but not her id card is some of the best toptier trolling ive seen all week
755 uh yeah this is san diegos policy liberal california in general turns out letting in a bunch of illegals creates higher crime poverty welfare recipients and lowered real estate value and why do we only talk about latinos europeans till this day use south american international airports as hubs to the us flying into caracas and tgen crossing the border not just latinos or hispanics the refugees from syria are doing this at an exaggerated rate too thanks to isis
austin is the city that will take texas down its cancer has spread like mad
im hispanic and the brown guy made no sense at all lmao i was just confused the whole time he was talking  build the wall 
an xray border that would vastly more expensive than a regular border
god help new mexico if this guy becomes governor smh
that guy in the white shirt was streaming online
that dude was high as fuck
drug war is scam and a way the government can use to harass people cause people should be able to consume whatever like into their body as it is their body and the immigration problem is simple dont build a wall because were doing fine with immigration in my opinion simply kick out the ones coming into the states breaking laws and let the ones comming to aspire to make a living stay
i cant fucking believe how dumb americans really are  its clear that this person attended public school until 6th grade  if you break the law you should be prosecuted  whats so fucking hard about that
has your mind ever been changed in these videos obviously
we want legal immigrants not illegal criminals
cocaine is a hell of a drug
i dont know why im deciding to comment because lowkey i kno my opinion doesnt matter but fuck it im against the wall because its against what america is about to hear things from the president like certain countries are shit wholes and wonder why there people are coming to america breaks my heart mind and soul the statue given to america by the french doesnt say give us ur best well feed satisfied people it saids give us ur poor give us ur hungry give us ur desperate that millions of immigrants that settled saw and gave hope to and the only test they had to pass was a health and basic knowledge test if they build that wall they better take that statue down and make sure they build 2 of them walls because last i checked this bitch has 2 borders and i kno quite a few illegal canadians but aint nobody out here questioning there citizenship
the wall isnt being built to keep mexicans out  its being built to keep the dumbed down americans in the dystopic masonic satanic matrix
you need to blur the ladys name tag  change her voice her life could be in danger from these people
534 it depends trump didnt mention the proportion but still httpswwwrealclearpoliticscomvideo20150616trumpmexiconotsendingustheirbestcriminalsdrugdealersandrapistsarecrossingborderhtml
i am not american but i support the wall
i wish someone who had a bit of knowledge on this would come talk to him its really not hard to explain why the wall is a horrible idea i should go find him and talk some sense into him
holy fuck that kid is killing me
build the wall is no problem how about pay for the wall
i feel bad for the poor lady she must be terrified living in her own community
lol that last guy was onto something you could build a long line of check points n shit and have people register and get photos taken so that they can be citizens  also have it protected  but a wall is dumb if it has none of that if its just a big ass wall with some dumb ass guards in shit who would eventually be bribable or able to be avoided then a simple wall sounds more like a retards wetdream building a usless wallwould take to much time and money if its just a wall on its own rather than a checkpoint wall or a citizenship wall
i might be wrong but surely there must be a cheaper and a better way to control iligal immigration than building a wall
they will break the law anyway so no reason to enforce is idiot
900k views in 1 day outstanding gentlemen
you can see everything on her id she is wearing around her neck and i mean everything

ochoa is the only wall we need
ok so i scrolled through about 100 comments and didnt see a post about this so  here it is 424 we might find some areas where we disagree vs areas where we disagree lose lose situation
dude this spanish guy is tripping balls
well there is already a fence sooo just make it a little higher and better steel would be cheaper no
this spanish dude is the typical ignorant uneducated fucking idiot who shouldnt ever speak what a ridiculous fool another voice of the leftliberal democrat ignorance what an absolute tool
someone should have asked what would happen if the entire country of india wanted to immigrate   since you know we should allow eceryo e a chance
dudes gonna have a doctors note as his passport through the xray force field
100 of illegal immigrants have committed a crime its in the name illegal immigrant
fuck trump and his wall xray borders and written explanations of why youre passing the xray checkpoints this is clearly how hillary got so far this dumb son of a bitch lol
after seeing this i want to build a wall and add snipers
i am for building the wall she is right though theyll get in somehow by making tunnels
the biggest way to solve this is to make immigration to the united states a lot easier period
what was that guy on
body positivity is cancer    change my mind
there are plenty of legal citizens who dont pay appropriate taxes what about them should we deport them i hear they arent contributing to our economy they live off our government what about people in tip based professions who dont claim their cash tips on taxes isnt that the same same thing
damn bro why you gotta use the worst examples 
wait wait wait he said that 35 of the population is illegal immigrants by the commit over 30 percent of murders then why is everyone looking at latinos everytime they bring up illegal immigration because 498  of homicides are blacks and 482  are white the rest is other so does that mean that most illegal immigrants are black or white cause all i hear when illegal immigration comes up is people talking about latinos its either that or crowders statistics are bullshit if you can explain this let me know i literally just got these statistics from fbigov so im pretty sure its a reliable source
petty political sublimation served to you fresh from his cuckold dumpster hah
6 million change my mind
i am neither conservative or liberal i am a man of facts why listen to me explain why we shouldnt when adam could httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkp9pr5ckfk
we all just some beans change my mined
how could anybody be that stupiduh 
this guy makes me feel like i have autism jesus christ xray gates
this guy needs to change the title of these change my mind segments because there is never a chance he will show or not edit the  clips insomuch as he will also never actual change his mind hes a prick
i love you steven but those shorts and shoes make you look a liiiiitle douchey
did you let that guy in  like wtf  this guy proves why you need proper immigration
hes against a wall but wants to have an x ray gate that monitors people digitally who comes in and out
blurs the womens face but not her id tag with a photo of her and her details
sono borders but xray borders with notes right then 
that guy made us hispanics look so bad bro lmao that guy is fucking dumb he literally made me loose brain cells and made my head hurt bruh cmon steven you have to remake this topic and talk to people who are some what smart dude legit said he plans on being the governor of new mexico talking about x ray lmaoo
this is painful
i hate people with opinions based on cognitive dissonance
your comments about immigrants committing a disproportionate amount of crime are complete falsehoods the opposite is true immigrants commit less crime then native citizens its your perception that is being skewed because your a racist fuckhttpsenmwikipediaorgwikiimmigrationandcrime
audio
what i really dont understand is why dont mexican just stay in their own country why do they even want to migrate to usa illegally enlighten me btw i am from the eastern part of the globe
this guy is a fucking idiot
im sorry but leroy just sounds plain dumbits hard to hear him talk
i would like to know what a wall could do instead of traditional border control like its done in other countrys the american border control is shit and cant live up to western world standards building a wall wont solve the problem since most drugs and illegal immigrants come in by plane and ship but yeah build a wall and waste tax payer money
1030 this guy talks all fast talking about a xray scanner and a group of masterminds classa tweaker bro
honestly so annoyed that he didnt bring up how much a walk would cost and how we would get that money especially since the us government is in massive debt also why didnt he mention that is there was a wall people will always find a way to get across
oh jesus oh dios mio this guy was justhes a shambles ma boy steve was so restrained talking to this guy i respect that i really do
home of the free not free if you have to have certain qualifications to enter also its a pretty big knowing that immigrants bust their asses a lot harder than americans i think they should be allowed in but must have a background check yes its said the be a free country but it has to be safe and you cant say that mexico drug trafficking will stop if a wall is built drugs are everywhere and there is no way of escaping them and stopping thwm
there is no country without a border
done with the change my mind segment because of the episode where yusefa kid who actually knew his stuff clearly took an interest in politics and was good at verbalizing his thoughts came up to talk and steven used every cheesy gimmick to get out of actually debating him crowders credibility and integrity dropped to 0 that day unsubbeddisliked blocked channel
that guy was complicating bar code tattoo ids
its amazing i got an ad by crtv of your video of two genders
one side wants to take all your guns and the other side wants to build a wall  once both sides get their way we will be in a very large prison  walls arent just to keep people out  walls are also to keep people in
lol hector was woke af
its like he was describing the book of revelation but with some illogical tangents like an x ray machine that spans the entire border
x ray border ey
i dont want a wall  i want a laser scanner that spans the lenght of the boarder and when you pass through   a computer levitates down out of the sky and you write why and where you are going with nothing stopping you from lying  and if you dont do what you say you are you will have to pay more when you go to the store and by a pack of skittles this is my understanding what he said  leave a criminal come into the country and if heshe breaks the law you tax them
70 of illegal immigrants from mexico came here on airplanes     hows that crowder  change your mind about the dumb fucking wall
screw the wall  lets all support the scientifical xray border
when you do these change my mind videos are the viewpoints you have in the video your real viewpoints not that theres anything wrong with your viewpoint its just that it seems like your viewpoint is always opposite to most peoples
why would u ask him to email you you already know hes not gonna say anything useful and just want to humiliate him some more made obvious by ur look at the end that says wow what an idiot
how weird would it be to be in a relationship with you i feel like you would need to be right all the time her babe its in my butt him no its not prove it
i dont think you should have made those huge subtitiles or in included rhe part with the girl trying to report people for her safety
im against illegal immigration however a wall would be ineffective and therefore a bad idea especially considering the 25 billion dollars to simply build it and more for maintaining it its because most illegal immigrants come legally but overstay their visas httpwwwpolitifactcompunditfactstatements2015sep08jorgeramosramos40undocumentedimmigrantscomeair
the mexican dude is on drugs
god the second person killed some of my brain cells
i live in toronto canada  just wondering if you guys would be willing to trade justin trudeau for donald trump please
a literal wall sounds like the idea a young child would suggest stupid idea a technological wall lets be smart here
wtf r these weird mexicans talking about lol
almost a million views in just a few hourshow much do yall wanna bet that youtube will never put this on the youtube trending page
that lady sounds insane
this boi say use  an x ray scanner 
people may win an argument but that doesnt mean theyre not wrongno matter how persuasive or influential they may sound  build that wall  is whats right  trump2020 and beyond
im not exactly sure how much the cost of illegal immigration is to the country per year  but im guessing that with illegal crossings being substantially reduced once the wall goes up  wouldnt that sort of negate the high cost of the wall when considering the money it saves the country in the long run  i assume that if its as effective as they expect it to be then eventually it will just fully pay for itself  i dont knowi could be wrong   im down for building it though  nobody thought he would actually build it  donald trump is awesome and at least he doesnt talk shit
morally wrong thats all it is
i dont usually agree with crowder but i always watch respectfully as these discussions are very insightful
just like you wont let anybody into your house because of structural integrity respect safety among other things so why would you let just anybody come into your country where your home is protected division is it always a bad thing and sharing is not always a good thing
its a waste of our money period
that dude is dumber than a ran over turd
the guy in the white shirt has ingested some of those illegal drugs he was talking about my god what a moron 
fastaimmigrantsawalladumbass idiot in the white shirt
its simple do not crossed the boarder illegally problem solved
me changing your mind i dont think the wall is cost effective i feel we need a better immigration reform like when europeans went to new york give legal statues who are a productive citizen to society those who commit crimes should serve time in american prison like who abuse the system like welfare tax evasion money laundering and stuff like that give me your tired your pooryour huddled masses yearning to breathe free the wretched refuse of your teeming shore send these the homeless tempesttossed to me i lift my lamp beside the golden door
alright people opinion aheadi believe that immigrants should be given one opportunity they want to be better well most anyway and want to help people back in their own country i understand it is illegal but america is the land of the free and the land of hope where dreams come true or so weve been toldthey are stealing our jobs i guess but most of them get the jobs that other people dont want working at minimum wage in terrible work conditions being employees for horrible bosses who take advantage of themof course a lot of them are fucking assholes who give immigrants in general a bad name those fucks dont deserve to be given any opportunities
im not trying to be racist i live and hang out with a lot of spanish people but not having a wall or border to filter out certain aspects will basically just make our country just like their country and eventually will become lawless from a democratic republic to a democracy to an anarchy
nope not getting out of this chairchange my mind
so when are we getting the funds from mexico again never you say ok thats what i thought
wtf was that guy even saying something something xray border gate scanners and other scientifical stuff yeah
i commend you on being on able to stay calm and listen to the stupid things people say easier when they arent rude people like this guy though
dude  leeroy is from the future
im no fan of illegals but i tried to look up some of stevens stats and they as usual seem false 3 of people here are illegals but commit what percent of murders look it up
for once i wish a video was staged please tell me this is
if you gave citizenships to immigrants that dont have a criminal record or are doing illegal things you would save the money for the wall they would be glad to be american citizens because they would be granted rights pay taxes greatly reduce incentives for going in illegallya few in the group resort to crime because you are giving them legal invisibility which can easily be abused i dont think you can possibly stop the problems with a stupid wall they will build tunnels under it throw the drug over it you name it its a complete waste and it send an awful racist message to the world you dont have to live all paranoid about immigrants because a small percentage of them behave poorly overall they add more than what they take from you so it would be nice to see some gratefulness from americans back to those hard working immigrants that have helped a lot to make america what it is today and always remember stats are often times awful oversimplifications they commit crime in a disproportionated way you know what they also do in disproportionated way hard work and if you ask me i think thats the real reason you have trouble with them because they compete with you in the labour market so you need the gangsters of government protecting you from the laws of offer and demand
damn that first lady made me so confused 
and this idiot whants to be a governor in mexicoreally
make a longer video about this please
i think the first guy made a really good point make money off of them instead of spending money deporting them
how hard is it to be respectful of other peoples opinion like holy shit
warning angry liberals down below
that second person literally said he would be down to execute the mark of the beast lol
oh god steven why as a fellow mexican i cant fucking stand this spic
well shit reading through the comments it looks like im the only one that feels really fucking ripped off by the fact that i changed my mind video was only 10 minutes long when i saw that this was uploaded i was so excited for the next installment to change my mind i was really bummed to find out this wasnt the next installment at all just a 10 minute teaser video that never got into the debt to other change my mind installments inevitably end up delving into felt like a really wasted opportunity i mean what you had on in the 10 minutes was worth watching but when you tend to do an hourlong show for the segments for everyone so far and then you get to this one the topic matter being kind of a big deal these days especially to america first advocates like myself i kind of expect it to match up with the other segments it doesnt matter how good the 10 minutes is theres just not enough content there to say its another actual installment to the series i mean seriously 10 minutes is all you could get you couldnt find anybody like maybe put it off for another week and invite somebody to actually have a conversation like all the other change my mind videos feature i mean i know that you prefer the organic approach of just letting whoever sit down but if you couldnt get anybody to do that aside from the people walking by and yelling obscenities you probably could have made an exception and invited somebody to actually try and change your mind on the subject that would have been a lot more worth watching that said if anybody on the staff of the louder with crowder show reads this i love your show generally speaking like this upload to i feel like i should mention that since i dont comment very often to say how much i like the videos as you go it tends to pipe up when i have criticisms so it might seem a little lopsided from a socalled fan when all you ever see from them is a comment like this but yeah i am actually a fan so try not to take it the wrong way you know 10 minutes for a series where every other video has been about an hour sometimes more is kind of weak sauce
can we build a wall around africa
how do i report those people i died 
we dont need a wall get rid of 100 of social programs and minimum wage laws and implement capitalism to its full extent and youll solve literally 100 of the problem
mexicans are some of the nicest most hardworking people ive met i really do feel sorry for all the people that want a better life but i do believe they should do it legally
how about my little tiny suggestion known criminals in mexico that have been previously arrested must wear an explosive collar cross over the wall and kaboom d make the border coyotes on the usa side happy yum yum and keep the paperwork to a minimum everyone wins
how many of you searched go green global channel jhahahahah
lol that dudes plan sounds like he wants to microchip every human being and have their coordinates pingd to the government 247 like some type of dystopian novel i hate these open society liberals
this guy might be on to something lol atleast he admitted it needs to be ironed out before its a completed thought
the solution is clear legalize and tax recreational drugs then the majority of illegal immigrants will not be a threat to society because the root cause of the violence referred to in those statistics is drug related crime once this is the case they will be far more willing to subscribe to the us government system to obtain potential citizen related benefits the war on drugs is the root of all evil aside from money i suppose this is all pending that the powers that be only have a problem with violence and care about inclusion and they dont have a problem  with cultural changes or population limits or something to that effect one cant assume the motives behind this sort of thing
legalizing marijuana would help so much i dont say it for stoners but for a hit towards drug wars
i keep waiting to hear intelligence from the left  nothing yet lol my dad used to call them numbskulls in his day  he was literally correct
dude
this guy literally sounds like he doesnt know that legal immigration is already a thing
its funny maybe if some of the stuff that guy said was reworded and not said by someone high af the stuff he said is low key genius
water is wet change my mind
i wish you would debate someone with an iq higher than 90 the first woman was clearly suffering from mental illness and the second guy was scattered and uninformed come on crowder take on someone your own intellectual size xray boarder  my goodness
1040 dudes talking about putting chips in people
im all for controlled immigration and agree with most things on this channel but i reckon a wall wouldnt be cost effective but i dont live in america so go your hardest 
i think the reason this guy keeps bringing up drugs is because hes high
why do i feel like this guy actually has a chance of becoming governor of new mexico smh 
what did china do they built a wall it didnt keep anyone out they made ladders where is the wall now half destroyed
dude  face palm to be honest  i actually get concerned watching these clips sometimes no wonder unemployment is low  tell me a job that you could trust that guy to do he would have a free thought and just not turn upyour face at the end said it all
incoherent i almost feel guilty for your two sitters the drivebyers are just smart enough to know they would get crushed in an actual debate
scientifical did he really just say that lmao ok and he thinks hes gonna be governer of new mexico boy find a new dream its just not happening mate xray border ok sure lol
waste of money there are planes and holes
what did hitler do he builds a wall what happened to the wall it was destroyed few years later so are we going to learn from history or are we going to keep repeating it
ok crowder your good but ever since the talk of the wall i have thought about its called a work visa my family used it to come to the us the contractor would pay for the visa for the worker i would like to talk about it with you
do a trump is a great president change my mind
636     they commit thirty seven percent of the homicidesso you heard it from this guy according to him illegal immigrants account for 37 of homicides in the usif you are going to throw statistics out there you should have actual sources to back them up and i have yet to find any sources anywhere that agree with these statistics that 35 of the population accounts for 37 of homicides normally honest people will provide valid sources in their description that back their claims and yet there isnt a single source link anywhere on the page in 2016 latinos illegal or mot made up 14 of all arrests for murder and nonnegligent manslaughterhttpsucrfbigovcrimeintheus2016crimeintheus2016topicpagestablestable21in 2015 they made up 16 of the arrestshttpsucrfbigovcrimeintheus2013crimeintheus2013tablestable43in 2014 158httpsucrfbigovcrimeintheus2014crimeintheus2014tablestable43considering that the overwhelming majority of illegal immigrants are latino and that latinos account for roughly 16 of annual murders i find it pretty hard to believe that illegal immigrants are somehow accountable for 37 of all murders especially considering that every statistic i have seen thus far completely disagrees with such nonsenseand for all of you saying im wrong i would ask that you actually provide sources like i did rather than making red herrings or factless statements
do white privilege is a myth
lmao saw an ad of steven crowder before this video
im not mexican im spanish
lol the dude is saying he supports illegal immigration but if they are documented assimilate  lol you mean like coming here legally with documentation
i wouldnt piss on crowder if he were on fire
this guy is foony
im incredibly benign about the wall  we should be able to enforce border security more effectively  the problem i do have with it though is that its a significant piece of infrastructure and the us already has a grade of d  we shouldnt be investing in any new infrastructure until weve rebuilt or at least reinforced what already exists
how can they argue when they havent been told what to say
steven crowder i am a big fan of yours this video is a bit upsetting because i wanted to get a more in depth understanding as to why its actually a good idea to build the wall i wanted to hear the real arguments around why we shouldnt build the wall like the tremendous cost wether or not it would be effective how it would be difficult to build because of geography whether it would be worth it these conversations werent very smart youre good at communicating the facts in an effective way so i wanted to see if this video could enlighten me on the issues but that wasnt the case put another one of these up with some smart people please
this isnt real there is no way this guy is serious if i lived in new mexico id vote for him for governor
ummm if they arent a citizens they dont get taxed because they are not on record is my understanding of this correct
xray boarder
for a guy who knows history
as soon as he said he wants to be the governer of new mexico i fucking died
so he doesnt want to stop them from coming illegally but he wants to track their movement with a tag once theyre here
the guy looks native american and he says hes spanish what a fucking moron im mexican and im blonde with green eyes and i dont say im spanish
wtfthe guy should of said cut the skull open and put a gps unit in everyone
the proper scientifical term for these poor people would be idiot
crowder really just makes up stats lol 35 of the country committing 37 of homicides highest number i could find was 2015 fox news  report at 12 in 2015
dude said scientifical nuff said
this guy is a genius build an ex ray border 
from spain my ass a lot of mexicans are so ashamed of being mexican that ese is from mexico 
not taking any side at the moment as i am not close to properly informed that said when looking up his claim about illegals causing 38 of homicides i found where he got that info but he leaves out a bit by not mentioning thats not a national percentage unless i misheard which i dont think i did anywayhere is the info he is referring tobetween 2008 and 2014 illegal immigrants accounted for 38 percent of all murder convictions in california texas arizona florida and new york despite accounting for just 56 percent of the total population in those states according to a report compiled by the government accountability office gao
should we just redirect him to adam ruins the wall
what happened to this guy at the endhis solution seems so funny 
2nd interview was retarded open borders moron
they way that guy ends so many words with an e is just hilarious when coupled with his ridiculously bad arguments
this guy trying to live in the year 2898  fail
poor bastards on both sides think theres a solution to all of this
i sympathise with the first lady confused as fuck about what the guy was trying to say no borders xray boarder master minded individuals to talk about it what
scientifical lolol
vote for spanish politician leroy for governor of the city of new mexico
it is an outrage that the president was forced to abandon his zero tolerance policy and of course the wall should be built at once i would love to say that it was because of people with the same mentality as the gentleman interviewed here but no it was the result of outrageous hysterics form people who should know better even assuming that the children that were separated from the adults that brought them were actually related to those adults which is unknown the allegations regarding the care of the children are outrageous the children had a bedno doubt a first for many as well as good and consistent food to eathow many of them went to bed hungry more often than not prior to their arrival in the camps in addition they got free new clothes and proper health carehow many of them had no doubt never seen a doctor or even a nurse in their lives to suggest that the treatment  of these children is in any way reminiscent of nazi germany is a blood libel against the president and the american people whose hard earned tax dollars payed for the proper care of these children whom they did not invite into the country
this guy wants to tax illegal immigrants and has had family in new mexico since around the 1550s lel
im not mexican im from spain bro this is the kind of mexicans i fucking hate  he has the fucking nopal en la cara and says he from spain because he searcher online where the last name sanchez came from and he saw it came from the spains when they came here
but how do you have an xray border without a border lol
if they want citizenship then let them join the military and fucking earn it
so whats the next step when the wall doesnt do anything to stop anyonenow taxpayers are out a lot of money and the problem hasnt stoppedwhats the next thing if youre going to build a wall you have to have a plan b for when that fails
i think these people forget that when the wall is built there will be border patrol there to stop them from walking up a ladder haha
when it is the next wall interview i want to participate
what that lunatic in white tshir9talking about that guy fully out of touchseems he is high
their is no such thing as mexican american
trending in canada
there are already walls and fences the only places there are no barricades of any kind are in remote areas how many  people saying build the wall or not build the wall have actually seen the border at major crossing points
hes not interviewing their best
these people are always so ignorant
s c i e n t i f i c a l xray border
numbers dont lie you pop off the charts when making these videos please make more often
i identify myself as a attack helicopter change my mind
topic idea can you do a change my mind on synthetic biology things like modifying crops animals designer babies generating tissuesorgans and arguing things like are we playing god is it natural does it do more harm than good is gene editing in babies a form of discrimnation
the idea this guy has sounds more in humane than whats being propsed lmao hes going to give the wrong elite white male a crazy idea lol
im in 2018 and this guy is in 3018
if you think they should build the wall yall should go to the boarder and check out the two walls they all ready have built all the boarder patrol officers that treat you like shit sit in the line for a few hours then have to go to second inspection because you brought your trailer and wait for 5 hours at the boarderfun and im sure it will be 10x worse if they do build the wall
im really stuck between building the wall and not building it my step father was an illegal immigrant since he was 18 hes 53 now and a few months ago he became legal he practiced for 2 months translating the english questions to spanish so he could understand went in and passed it by the end of it he knew more about america and american history than me and my siblings and we were born us citizens i definitely think people should come here legally i just wish it wasnt such a long process for other people
not gay jarod looks like cheap security 
wrong fucking video bud lost a huge supporting crowd
just tax em
that man claiming to be spanish is mexican af not even he would believe his own lie
stevencrowder blur out the ladies id too
that guy is on meth for sure
i plan on being governor of new mexico this guy is a different class of stupid an xray border
that dude seemed native or something he seems like a nice guy but weird as hell
a group of masterminds and  xray scanners
lol crowders face at the end 
this was fucking stupid
the statistics show that 103 of the violent crimes in the us are committed by illegal alaskan immigrants
this was a waste of time you have to visit universities where people are more educated on this topic not the gutter of random fan boys i swear i completely got lost for 13mins
xxxtentacion is not dead change my mind
it was my birthday when this was posted lol
im not mexican im from new mexico  rofl
this gave me aids
steven would gain a lot more credibility if they linked to the stats he cites it wouldnt be that hard
comocedice dumbass
too cringe to listen to
i think people hate the wall because 1 trump 2 just bcuz i believe the benefits of the wall far outweighs the negatives south americans who are trying to escape gang violence and their constant persecution by migrating to the us can actually be better regulated and controlled if there was a wall give them tax ids and simple labor jobs to build up from there better than la becoming a freaking war zone like now ie
5 to 10 years just watch man
lmao this dude who sat down is a fucking retard
i hate when people as ignorant as that guy act relevant please get informed dude
dont build a wall instead track everyonethats disturbing big brother rises
these are the most stupid suggestions for border security and enforcement ever xrays what a tarred
the hell leroy
the man in the white shirt is obviously not spanish hes just trying to hide very stupidly that hes mexican
look i am all about enforcing legal immigration but the time and money it takes to immigrate legally means that overstaying work visas is way easier and then what a wall isnt gonna stop overstaying work or student visas and also isnt going to stop immigrants in the us legally teaching others how to get in  but relaxing legal immigration laws might mean that people gravitate toward doing it legally and stop them from hiring coyotes or smuggling drugs to get here because it is a better option why cant anyone else see that i lean left from a conservative standpoint and honestly if we spend more money stopping immigration than from allowing it it doesnt make cents
this fucking guy im not mexican but he talks moves and acts like a cholo paisa hybrid no mames wey
this is the problem with younger people today data can be cheated easily and the bigger problem is language is and rules of law people just walk on in and make a home and say f u and do what they want and 5 to 10 years this guy has no idea of time
ive heard many immigrants just come here by plane using a visa and than overstay their visa and under the radar if this is true a huge wall would be pointless if everyone comes in by plane again this is just something i heard stevencrowder what are your thoughts
the wall is going to be builtand not a damn person is going to do anything about it comment i dare you
whats sad is these people that sit down to talk think theyre highly intelligent and aware people but the guy who sat down has no clue whats coming out of his own mouth i had to stop watching because it gets very frustrating
thisguy poor steven
even if we were able to give citizenship and require taxes on all incoming immigrates the majority 5055 would still be on food stamps and get their tax breaks back at the end of the tax season pointless
we cant afford it
i lost brain cellsalso we already have a border why spend our taxes there when we can spend it on education or something to help our economy
no walls  build a land mine field  just like the one that separates north and south korea and seen in action in the james bond movie goldeneye which was on the other day
they need to have some sort of electronic identification some sort of passportguest how would they check that without control over borders with a wallhost  i dunno advidkendhxhdkebdkqpe 
do one on population growth and what will happen when the world becomes overpopulated
lol 100 of illegals are criminals
printing pretty hard there steven
1057 scientificalfuckin a man
hey steven give me the facts and i will do the field work for the right price i would really like the field work for change my mind
omg this guy 
building the wall is an incredible waste of tax payer money when ending the drug war would solve most of the problems on the southern boarder legalize everything then tax according to how addictive the drug is and use that money to fund rehab centers and we wont need a stupid wall
crowder getting a bit arrogant now and seems to be leaning towards making people looking stupid instead of the intended purpose
stevencrowder i know you may not see this but blur her badge asap
wheres regans immigration reforms when we need them
he aint gonna be the governor or shit
this guy in the white shirt is stupid
so maybe take over mexico before we run out of room just make mexico a part of america
this guy wants us to live in a 1984 society so we dont have to build a wall lol  this guy is as high as girafee pussy
im sure the leftist cunts will say she is just suffering from internal racism or some stupid bullshit its just easier to blame the victim than to admit they were wrong
god damn people are dumb leroy  the future governor of new mexico is something else
leroy is on angel dust or something
this dude doesnt get it  people from poor places competing with people that live here where it isnt dirt cheap and we dont wipe our asses with our hands here
poor leroy walked right into the lions den and made a total ass of himself just to plug go green i can only aspire to that sort of dedication
yes
when youre dead you dont know youre dead its only difficult for others its the same when youre stupid
go to uic please one of the most diverse campuses and i believe you will have some fun responses big fan
the wall is a tough subject im a permanent resident here and i believe that illegal and undocumented immigration should be slowed down yet i do wish for a big flow of work visas given for immigrants for all countries bordering our country the wall will do nothing theres a huge percentage of the crossing that goes on underground not through borders until people see how countries are where illegal immigrants are coming from until privileged people  not saying youre privileged crowder see what its like to be in fear for your life where either you go into selling drugs or being a slave for cartels or else you die they will be forever opposing people coming here illegally perhaps if the us helped in a minor way to clean up those counties the poor people who cant afford work visas or cant prove that they own property will keep on coming to safety el salvador cuba puerto rico mexico and even south american countries all immigrate to the land of opportunity to survive and i believe we can find a legal way to get them help through work visas or even implementing a program where companies go to those countries providing then with jobs yet the us gain a percent of the income gained from them idk a legal alternative to ending the suffering and forcing of them fleeing to safety here in the us
the guy in the white shirt is on fukn meth
can you invite more educated people onto your show to debate with these people are clueless
this guy added an a to the end of a lot of words
omg tipical libtard bs come on steven
646 not gay jared standing there looking like a chad
why build a wall when most illegal come by plane and over stay their visa and why build a wall for mexico only when we have plenty of people who come from all different coumtries
lets not build a wall lets just all get chipped and build an xray reader across the bordersduhhh
i think that building a physical wall is pointless i believe that stricter border security would be a great idea hell look in the comments im sure many of these wall supporters could help patrol this new wall the fact is that many illegal immigrants come into the country legally and just overstay their welcome
leroy is dumb as hell
this guys ignorant af im mexican and this dude is just blabbing random shit
and that guy has his own show on what exactly incoherent babbling stammering nonsense and how to speak it these are fun segments for the most part but seriously did you just pick the most ignorant individual to waste screen time on or did no one else sit down with a single compelling thought christ fuck this was painful
what the fuck is this superman xray borders 
that guys idea was so terrible do you know how much this xray thing would cost to make you already complain about the wall and then how are people coming from another country already going to have the chip and we dont need government involved in more stuff what he wants is globalism and its a dumb idea this is why people that know nothing about politics or how things work should have no say in it
bah hahaha hey free flowing xray wall dude shoot me your youtube channel i cant wait to lose more iq points watching your pov videos for pure amusement
when are you in the liberal state of nj would love to watch you live ill even do security for free
pedro for mayor of new mexico 2023
nuke the border
this idiot wouldnt get hired to do the governors laundry let alone be the governor  moron
a more freeflowing xray gate lmfao yall should just build a wall around him
the mexican dude needs to apply for space force
i dont care about your sob story no passport no entryedit lady sounds lake brandon rodgers philipiono voice443 standardsa448 makea505 drugsaedit 2 stevens side burns lol1057 scientifical1106 tongue1137 flicks tongue  stares off into the distance  i one day plan on being the governor of new mexico1140 that guy in the back looks not gay1318 good reaction
is it just me or did you just turn a liberal mexican into an ultra conservative in just one short convo
sounds like that guy just described a wall that funnels towards a checkpoint with x ray machines so border patrol tsa agents
yeah only let an old lady and a crazy guy proposing future tech as a solution  talk that way you arent actually challenged to a debate on a dumb topic
this woman is afraid she may face harm possibly death for reporting illegal immigrants the guy is a real knucklehead xray door in the middle of the desert that immigrants will surely use sounds like a modern version of blazing saddles
if the new mexican guy becomes governor someday we are screwed  he is not the sharpest knife in the drawer
i feel like the problem is mexico its self that goverment needs to get their shit together when things are bad in a country people flee to look for better lives not to mention the cartels who are the ones responsibles for the drugs crossing the border its not like mexican immigrants just bring drugs for no reason like i said  its mexico that needs to do something
why dont we just make legal immigration easier then there would be a huge decrease in illegal immigration and those that come over would not have to hide under the radar they would then have to pay taxes and competition between american citizens and immigrants would be more fair
sad
i dont think a wall will be very effective  nowadays many illegal immigrants enter our nation by overstaying visas or going underground  this is not some ancient civilization where a wall will keep enemies out
lowest iq change my mind ever  change my mind
honesty those are really bad examples by really narrow minded people feel really badly represented by those people
oh gosh
there have been numerous studies that show conservatives are more fearful and their worldview reflects that on the other hand liberals can be too open and trusting liberal minded people have compassion for others outside of their own bubble conservatives have a selective compassion for their own i dont know if this political ideology is biological theory is true but im just trying to play mediator im not sure how to find a middle ground but in the meantime these folks even if illegal should be treated humanely that should be the number one priority
the one thing that comes consistently in any of my discussions is regarding the cost and what else the money could do infrastructure is expensive sad that we didnt get some well informed back and forth
the demorats will destroy the united states 
dude  im about to drive up to your studio and bitch slap you  youve just jeopardized that womans life to make a point
that guy wow steven you have a great deal of patience
build the wall
i mean building a wall wouldnt do that much because illegal immigrants dont come on foot anymore they come with planes and overstay their vacations building a wall would keep the illegal immigrants here because usually they work for a bit and then go back to mexico
cocaine is one hell of a drug
he needs to stop smoking weed
elrond hubard should really try to research reality a bit before running for governor
hes so fucking stoned bruh 
sorry steven i couldnt make it through this video that guy was unbearable to listen to
this guys argument instead of building a wall to stop illegal immigration is to make an xray that tracks any human being that crosses the boarder
the look steven gave at the endthat was my face for the last 9 minutes of this video 
lol wow i see so many people win arguments with you in my eyes its hilarious
this guy needs to shut up already
please do not do not leat this guy someday be be the governor of new mexico
crowder i love these videos and especially this particular topic but please please please please interview someone whos not on crack next time
this guy has like 4 brain cells
dont do drugs kid
no wall just remove the incentive to come her illegally crack down on welfare fraud stop giving them handouts they want the shit they have to pay taxes to get it
ive got a quick question  steven mexicans can get visas and ride planes how would you fix that because planes can go over walls
that dude has watched zeitgeist it seems
hes high as shit
a ladder
you need to blur her out or just upload the audio with a distorted voice
was this in las cruces or albuquerque
if mexico was a better place to live they wouldnt need to cross the border
i can kinda understand the ladys point if a war is started you may not be able to return
holy fuck that spic was retarded
the guy with the camera was pathetic and he plans to be governor of new mexico ha ha ha ja ja ja
my stance if they are supporting the us and trying to be an american then they should be put on the path to citizenshiponly problem is that is hard to enforce
dude needs to stop watching syfy showshe was respectful tho
i dont like the fact that people like to pin illegal immigration soley on latinos  theres a shit ton of asians and europeans but nahhh lets get the mexicans who in general are hard workers and its not there fault that the system does its best to stur the youth into a direction that is expected of them
what should we do about rapists just tax them we can profit man
esteven if americans were the ones crossing illegally the border into mexico then it will be the mexicans that would be asking their military to patrol the border with the united states and to build a wall in order to stop the influx of illegal americans border jumperas for the latino undereducated scum that you have to deal with during your segment they should all need to get arrested and thrown in jail afterwards they should be deported along with their families and friends periodi know that most of the illegal immigrants are not hardcore criminals most peasants are hard workers but they are criminals by default since they themselves broke our laws the moment they decided to cross illegally into the usa i know if you cross illegally into any latin american country and if you managed somehow to obtain fraudulent paperworkdocumentation get a job and afterwards get caught you would be prosecuted incarcerated and then deported along with the rest of your family should they be there also illegallyfor the latino community to think that somehow they should be exempted from immigration laws of the us supply because they are from the same continent is purely nonsense build the wall deport all illegals and use the us military to patrol the border whislt the wall is being buildi am not a hater but their problems shouldnt be our problems especially the gang culture and the rest of the illegals that prey on the legal immigrants like that lady in the segmentgood job as always looking for new topics to watch and discuss
he is wasting oxygen make it stop
pop tarts are raviolichange my mind
third wave feminism does more harm than good change my mind
i dont agree because it seems like a waste of money
lol
i think that the illegals here should have a path to some sort of citizenship the ones who commit very bad felonies ie  murder  should be deported and instead of ingesting 25 billion in a wall use 5 billion to bump up security on the border and use the rest to fix our crumbling infrastructure
build the wall
pablo really did not seem to understand the concept of people crossing the border without going through his marvel vs capcom xray gates
anyone fact check stevens stats also can you shere your sources
the wall is not worth the amount of tax payer money that it would take to build itthe money would be much better spent in fixing up our infrastructure or other things
even if its just 1 crime build the wall to stop that 1 crime from happening again simple
i love the bad data on the crimes you are not even kind of close
what will the wall solve that is the real question its not like its gonna stop shady deals done between  the dea special agents  elite drug cartel bosses so tell me how will it solve this
why dont people talk more about the root problem  mexico is a shhole country  thats why people keep coming here is there anything we can do to help mexico cant we just annex the place
dont build the wall because it will cost millions of dollars this money should be put towards our failing education system proof that our education system is failing is the rise of flatearthers
the last guy is against borders but he is just describing them when he is asked what he would do wtf
that guy an idiot
i want what that dude is on
keep them out or keep us in what happens when all hell breaks loose in america and theres walls on the northern and southern border and we cant get out
i agree with peter kirsanow whether illegal immigrants commit crimes at a higher rate than us citizens is not the point illegal immigrants do commit crimes and each one of those acts is a crime that should not have been committed in the usa should not have been given the opportunity to occur
i feel like everyone he debates is very un educated in the situation they dont articulate there words properly not do they form a good argument people like that are very ignorant in the topic steven i like you but i dont like you i like you because you sound understanding and reasonable i dont like you because you made a video on vox impersonating a gay person which i am not offended by but i see it as a childish way to construct an argument most of your comebacks in that video were weak but im not going to judge you on that you should start talking to a person that is more educated in that field like maybe trevor noah you might not like him but theres no harm in a simple conversation i also like how you say change my mind yet they never do because your perception is your reality and we cant change that as a human living in this world you should just let people live there lives exactly how they want to unless it affects yours
these guys can have electronic ids or passportshow are you gonna check that they have themi dont knowrightyou dont know that dude is literally a walking dictionarycom page for the word idiot
why build walls aint no mexicans attacking us
a xray border  sounds like star trek shit
rip xxxtentacion
510 my familys been in new mexico since the 1550s did i hear that right
how about we come together as one fucking human race and move forward together as one
main reason why libtards dont want the wall it makes them angry apparently thats wrong we shouldnt make them mad because that hurts their feelings and that out rules everything
ngj rocking the cleveland indians cap  rolltribe
such a wasted opportunity
there were so many points that could have been made if someone with some decent vocabulary would have sat down lmao
that guy is not very smart    laughably insane ideas he has
somebody should have told this guy while he was growing up that hes an idiot  it really is a disservice to these dumbasses to let them think they have a clue they just end up thinking that other people want to listen to what they have to say on a subject they know absolutely nothing about
props to the dude for being respectful but ffs man youre not going to be the governor of new mexico
the wall should have gone up in the 60s when immigration started changing
governor of new mexicogary johnson 20
this spanish mexican sounding dude trippin lmao 
so hes saying were gonna have teleporters in 5 years
liberals are fuckin idiots jesus christ
whenever someone sees the wall they assume racism
that guy at the end seemed like he was really trying to be intelligent and ambitious which i totally respect but he seemed pretty phukin stupid lol
part 2 please
couldnt listen to that second person lol
or you could make it cheaper and faster to become documented so they arent illegal anymore 
do flat earthers id loooove to see this
im a trump supporter but a physical wall in my opinion isnt the solution i think the us should attempt to purchase a physical line 50 miles deep into mexico  it make it a military operated zone  i dont know if that is exactly how it works but shit its my idea im sticking to it
now i know how i sound when i try to make things up on the spot
its a waste of money its not cost effective
this guy in the year 3047
im one of those cheap pricks  but i love the show honestly haha keep up the amazing content
i wouldve lost my patience with that guy a lot sooner than steven did wow
they tried getting people to just give up an id and democrats gots super mad about that  written notice xray scan in your skin
the second guest isnt using his headtheres already a process in which those entering the country take a test and get taxedits called the immigration process to us citizenship you know the way legal immigrants have been doing it for years upon years now what hes describing already exists and yet msm doesnt acknowledge it in fact they twist words around disingenuously and group immigrants in with people illegally entering the country
httpcriminologyoxfordrecomview101093acrefore97801902640790010001acrefore9780190264079e93  educate yorself
wall  autistic to much money just do better enforcing the border
what the fuck was that dude talking about
just give this man some intelligent individuals to discuss this with and he will fix the worlds problems in no time trust it
20000000000 in taxes to build that wall taxation is theft
assuming that woman isnt an actor can you blur out her purse it can be easily used to identify her
no we new mexicans have issues with the illigal immigrants
an xray border
so he doesnt support borders and doesnt expect people to respect the wall but thinks that they will his xray thing
im a liberal im against the wall for a couple of reasons one being why build a wall costing billions when a new president in 4 years could take it down  but wtf was that last dude talking about  i want an xray boarder gtfoh
who cares about what your stances on illegal immigration are  if you really think that building a wall across the entire usmexico border is a cost efficient thing to do and will actually decrease illegal immigration then your dilusional
i just got an ad with ben shapiro speaking about victim statuses and why theyre bs bruhhh yas
fuuuuuucken leroy chicano from the future
im usually a fan of these but this hit in a personal spot it is so hard for someone who is south of the border to come here legally mexico does not have the same education system as the united states i say that because our people dont have the knowledge to be able to come here legally and i get it building a wall to keep away the bad people but in reality your keeping away all people i wish i had family who have been deported here with me of course i could go see them when i want but its hard to see them that way its easier said than done why not try to help each other than separate each other there are so many history lessons about building walls to separate people we havent learned anything
i dig how you remain professional throughout with all this toxic behavior in this world its hard not to become passionate i obviously dont agree with some of youre reasoning but i agree with your mature take on these harsh  topics love the content
homeboy had a great idea unfortunately we dont live in a syfi movie so until this genius develops a human zerox scanning chipping system that could actually workbuild the freaking wall
this was way too short for such an important subject please do multiple videos for this come to arizona
jajaj  ive met people from new mexico than claim they are spanish or spaniard jajaj hes just a fancy mexican   go eat some green chile you lame ass dude
the dude was all over the place
im agree that ilegal immigrants should not be tolerated but i think laws should be more simple for residency as long as the government can verify they are not criminals dont have any criminal background in their country and they have a job and they are paying taxes thats good enough for mefor citizenship well besides the requirements for residency they have to make sure they pledge loyalty and alliance to the us and make sure they agreed not to pretend to change the culture and they adapt to it but that should not be a hard thing to doabout the walk im against why cause its too expensive and i dont think its going to be nearly as efectivo as people think funny to se a trillion dollar wall bein ignored by a thousand dollar undergronud tunel not the brightest idea there
that dude is fucking cluelesswhat a fucking moron
a piece of paper doesnt stop anyone from doing some thing wrong something physical like the wall will this country is our home if you dont want to contribute to regulations and keeping our southern americans  and boarders safe then pack your shit and go back to where one of your ancestors are from because you clearly are useless and we need productive people here one question for you libtards and the rest of the leftif you care about these immigrants and want to help them why not let them live with yousome wont have a place to go so let them live with you if you care so much dony worry you can afford it according to the reasons some of you have to let them over here without going through the legal procedure like some of their people have done
man crowder fuck you
change my mind  dude  more like waste my time  lol  poor stephen had to endure that load of ignorance lol
httpswwwchronicleonlinecomopinionletterstoeditorfactsaboutillegalimmigrationarticle7b969762b05f11e79dc5a7e702b194a9html in case anyone wanted a source
sanctuary cities in california where i live have a high rate of crime such as sex crimes illegal drug use prostitution gang violence and are horrible places to live santa ana is riddled with sex offenders more than any other city in oc most the people driving in santa ana dont have a license and i cant tell you how many times immigrants get killed from walking in the middle of traffic its not just mexicans or hispanics either its also vietnamese
i say build the wall because either way they are gonna find a way to get over how to fund it cut it out of the military spending budget stop buying those f22 raptors and put it towards the wall instead the us military budget isnt gonna miss 1020 even 30 billion dollars especially if you take it in small increments lets say 510 billion every year until its build
meh these people didnt really offer good discussion
this guy just debates chumps honestly
taxation is theft  change my mind
blockchain technology could do what that 2nd man is proposing
steven this dude is on coke or some upper his mouth is out running his mind
i like crowder but he referenced an inaccurate statistic  illegal immigrants account for 13 of murders not 37
im a mexican american and proudly a conservative
you guys should blurr out the id tag of the lady not only her normal face
im for legal immigration and boarder enforcement but im not entirely for the wall i think there could be a more time and money efficient way to enforce our boarders
just to get it right steven you do believe in an actual wall spend billions on something that will only incentivize the ingenuity of people smugglers and drug traffickers probably even increasing their profits is just plain stupid most of this issues arent being fixed from the source that wall and all the securing the border theater is just playing dumb at the expense of taxpayers
awwwwwe the mexican lady was so sweet
im not educated on this wall issue why is the wall a problem if it keeps illegal immigrants out
im not mexican im spanish  my family came to mexico in like the 1550s 
mexicans never want to be called mexican im spanish  theyre so racist against anyone whos any shade browner
steven you might find some areas where we disagree versus areas where we disagree crowderappreciate you man keep up the great work
when the guy started talking about an x ray border i was dead
why build a wall when we can be using the time for more other progressive things that wall has little purpose and i can be rong but im honest thats how i feel
wow this channel sucks and im sad i just wasted 13 mins and 44 seconds of my life on this shtty video poor argument on both sides but im sure he picked the discussions that made him look better its easy to sound smart when you pick the most idiotic people to interview
drugza lol
while i do agree on the wall being put up i appreciate the guys positive outlook on wanting to help make traveling easier for humanity sure its far fetched and out there but he was super respectful and seemed like a positive dude
leroy was soo mad lol
nothing like taking to a free thinker to argue against a democracy
its people like this spanishamerican man who are exposed to liberal ideas and accept them without question who are the real problem
answer mexicans gonna dig under that mf
just an idea based on what the spanish man was talking about but perhaps a system could be introduced where only registered residents gain access to credit healthcare cars licences and purchases for example property purchases and anything else that isnt a necessity like police and fire services to continue getting access to anything like that you would need to be hardworking taxpaying member of society of course before anything like that could happen you would need to crack down on things like unlicensed drivers i have the luxury of living in a small country the uk and so its so much easier for the government to keep these things regulated i dont know anyone without a drivers licence or insurance that drives a car or anyone that has made purchases of a similar size to cars without going through all the legal procedures its very difficult to commit crimes like that and not get caught in a country where theres very few places to hidei dont agree that a wall is the solution because as many others have stated they will always find a way its main purpose is a stroke to ego and to beat chinas great wall im sure it certainly makes a statement that the us is desperate to keep out immigrants and doesnt care about the fiscal cost
im just gonna wrap myself in tinfoil and roll myself over the border so im not detected easy
go anywhere  super cheap  oh thats what their being told huh  slick
its only business  business is harsh  thats why everyone pissed off at trump  drug war  immigration war  fuckin wars are business  go ahead and fight it youll all stay broke  everyones worried about border lines on this small minded  if your gonna think  than think big
so if their are 2 billion illegal immigrants trying to enter are solutions is to tax them ohhhhhhh my
the guy with the xray idea reminds me of the girl who went viral saying the solution for global waming is to install a while bunch of giant air conditioners you cant make this stuff up
scumbag needs to learn english first
the thing is that most illegal immigrants dont walk or ride across the border they fly in with a work visa and stay here and continue working there trade here have a border wall doesnt help remove these people and it brings up the question of if we even should because they are usually working a trade that most americans wont do because it doesnt correspond with the whole college path that most americans want so it would be ineffective and extremely expensive it would also effect the usas ability to conduct trade with other nations because of the likely global out lash and this video gave me the idea that his videos are staged and he only pulls the most ignorant people out of the ones he talks to inorder to create the same echo chamber that he complains about twitter being for liberals the hypocracy is just very startling
hahhha fucking mexicansthey have built a border wall in their southern border to prevent their neighbours from coming in and they have a rule where no political party like demorats or president can change their demographics by bringing in people from outside
the conversation was frustration dude just was not talking well no clear thought just wanted to be heard
what he means to say is lets have a orwellian system for illegals wth
build the fuckin wall  who cares  excellent national monument  piss my tax dollars  americans go to school and learn the tax game its only business mexicans come over here and take our jobs  if you want to stay hav3 better ideas than our politicals   its only fuckin business
a wall wont change nothing
the guy in white was definitely on some drugs
republicans bashed sanders for advocating for free college because its too expensive lmfaooo how much would your wall cost
37 of murders are committed by illegals bullshit
a wall thats kind of retarded
does he realize that even an xray contraption would technically still be considered a wall baaaahaaaa
the way that guy adds an uhat the end ofevery third word gives me the fucking creeps
507 so you say youre not mexican then you say youre from spain then you say your family has lived in new mexico since the 1550s dude is mexican as shit and his accent isnt fooling anyone ese lol
he sits down with some real idiots but they are atleast better than the asses that just drivewalk by an cuss and are to chicken shit to give logical reasons to their stances and more than 90 havent thought deep enough about the issues to get past starting their sentences with i feel
stevencrowder i would love to have been there to debate you about this i believe i could have changed your mind
walls keep people in that is the main argument i would have against a wall just ask anyone who lived in east berlin
chowder crowder i love your vids im black so its all fun you canadian bastard i support you 110 im from the up of michigan ha so were as close as we can get  ill stir the pot with you any day my friend
lord the second dude is stupid
the second guy has an extremely low iq
shes probably been shot by now
the second guy is trying to say there will be no boarders in 510 years
in this segment ive noticed that almost everyone speaking is uninformed and uneducated
what the fuck  dont build a wall but make an xray border and just make sure that all the people come in and pay taxesthe problem isnt illegal immigrants  its the idiots who already live here
 not cost effective will not prevent illegal immigrants as many of them do not come into the unitedstates of america on foot
will a gun free zone sign stop shootings if you say no and think a wall will stop immigrants from getting into america you are part of the problem
i like how the video is in the comedy category
this was unproductive
ladders tunnels plenty of ways to get here waist of my mothers tax payer money
i just dont see how building a wall is the solution to our problems the violence that occurs is a by product of the situation there country is in instead of making them pay for a wall that essentially does nothing to better there community we should be helping out mexico to get gangs and crime off the streets that would be the only way to permanently stop illegal immigration
best interview ever in order to get rid of illegal immigrants we should make them legal huh  okaaaay  hahahahahahahahawhat was he thinking may be he was nervous nice try anyway
that second guy thought he was in a movie
ice is frozen water change my mind
steven crowder if we were to build the wall it would have to go through rivers and mountains most of the illegal immigrates in america came here legally but happend to out stay there visa
that look at the end made my day  lol
people immigrate to the us because quality of life in mexico is atrocious our daily minimum wage is about 4 dollars a typical sallary for a college graduate is about 1000 dollars a month and that would be considered a great pay there are high paying jobs around 10 k a month but thats a very small segment of the populationeven if you are rich though our infrastructure is a nightmare streets are not propely paved and not to mention how dangerous it is just to live here kidnapping is so common mugging in any part of the city and most of all the corruptioni was stopped by police last week just walking home and they robbed meif you try to open up a business you have to pay extra just to get your papers processed and also you run the risk of being threatened by narcos to pay a fee for protectionso yeah you say its not our problem well it isnt just as it isnt our fault to have been born in this country you also say come here legally do you know how hard and expensive it is to be able to do sokeep in mind our retarded wages someone said as well because we cant tell the difference between the good or bad people that come here seeking refugei would argue that anyone that chooses to risk their life crossing a border going into a country that clearly doesnt want them knowing that they will exploit and demean them is a refugee
she got caught snitching on camera she dead
that guy is silly
come to el paso texas
i was expecting that guy to end with hey man wanna go get some tacos
gonna leave this fun fact right here as ive done all night long on left leaning channels httpsgopcomflashbackdemocratstalkedtoughonimmigrationrsr
build the wall tall wall go ice
wow theres alot of lefties in the comments section pretending to be fans who are disappointed in crowder and trying to put doubt in peoples heads
ive watched all the change my mindsand this is by far the worst its unfortunate that some of the passionate people that could give an actual viewpoint on this issue were represented by two crazy people you gotta redo this one man 
put the money towards the space force instead it could save humanity bigger than some border issue if your mind isnt changed i think you need to rethink your priorities like the future of your children
build a wall  what are you 10 
the walls that are built to keep those out will also keep those in me
leroy watches too much scifi movies
stevens point that illegal immigrants commit more crime has been disproven by multiple studies apparently illegals commit less crime than people born here i guess that makes sense because theyre afraid of being deported and dont want to get in trouble with the law here are a few of the articles i found that said this httpswwwnprorg20180502607652253studiessayillegalimmigrationdoesnotincreaseviolentcrimehttpswwwgooglecomampswwwwashingtonpostcomamphtmlnewswonkwp20180619twochartsdemolishthenotionthatimmigrantshereillegallycommitmorecrimehttpcriminologyoxfordrecomview101093acrefore97801902640790010001acrefore9780190264079e93maybe hes just afraid of mexicans because of his subconscious racial bias 
there is much better ways of border control then a wall that by now weve seen that will come out of the us citizens pocket the research shows that the terrain this wall will cover is extremely harsh and although it can be done it will be in my opinion to much money that can be spent on better things
finally and yes build the wall
xray wallxray wallone more time did i hear him right xray walli guess all idiots really do aspire to be politicians
just want to say a comment about  the young goobers statement about the pharmaceutical drug problem yeah thats a big problem its also the biggest gateway to heroin addiction which is smuggled here on the backs of those immigrants
these change my mind videos would be so much better if you talked to some smart people too
people that agree we should have open borders are obviously retarded
leroy makes me want to cry lol where the hell have you been bro omg
that second guy was high as fuck
dude at 1000 wants to like just put a fucen chip in every person in the world
okay let me get this  if illegal immigrants find it hard reporting crimes to cops and partaking in national consensus should i trust statistics that say they commit less crimes  nb statisticians claim to speak directly to them
maybe all these people need to live in tents with no walls to protect them and see how long that lasts  walls are built to protect
omg the last guy was a fruitcake    he sees borders as a thing of the past   people will be able to travel fast wtf  he needs to mastermind this with others   what a space cadet 
dudes family has been in new mexico since the 1550s
ever heard of a ladder
go to colleges or plan these in advance dumb people are boring
typical liberal cunts walk by talking shit and giving the finger very brave
unedited
leroy with the lore from the future
see this first one is sad  the second one said you cant deport everyone i disagree hitler was able to deport 6 gorillian jews in less than 4 years twice to first the ghettos and then to concentration camps if you believe the propaganda and that was in the 1940s i believe our technology could deport 10 million people in half that time now build the wall and deport all of the illegals with the executive order trump just signed we need to carry this out to the next logical step all legal citizens being held in jail awaiting trial need to sue the us government to allow them to bring their families into the facilities with them use these laws and show them how stupid these decisions are
building the wall forces them to change their approach if you anticipate that change you can make the wall extremely effective
if you want change vote to end the welfare state and open the borders wwwlporg
yes be harsh with our boarders but the child and parent legislation does need some reform
i want to know the story behind the tree in the first ladies water bottle
build the wall proud american son of argentineans
honestly steven  i support trump but the wall will cost to much money and solve almost no problems sorry steven but i cant agree
could you do one about how the school system is outdated and broken
yo this episode sucked ass
holy fucking shit this guy is almost no different than any other liberal please just stamp our foreheads and track and monitor every time she take a shit
impose a heavy fine on employers who hire illegals  that will make it financially impossible to make money as an illegal or off of them
second guy was a moron
this guy is just talking out of his ass crowder is king 
how can we tax them if we dont know theyre here or how many of them there are
when will people realizethroughout modern history white people are bashed beyond belief for the way they live yet name 1 time a massive group of white people has ever tried to immigrate to a non white nation  in the modern era last 400 years or so we have hundreds of cases of coloured people leaving there shit holes behind to come where the evil white man built up a desirable society  im not saying any white power shit here im stating a fact we get beat down but never get any credit for the very reason why everyone wants to come to where we build something up from the dirt it truly amazes me we could swap places with mexico overnight land for land but within a few years once we build up mexico into the new america the mexicans would come to the new america  and people would still say fuck white people i really dont get it
yikes mr ex ray needs to grab a newspaper and stop reading the back of cereal boxes stevens face at the end was a perfect reaction
oh em gee
this guy is such a fool i could only watch half the interview because he talks like a toddler ie saying the same incomplete thought 3x in a row and proud of making an intellectual point the man simply spewed word vomit in an exciting manner unfortunately thats all it takes to get additional dumb ppl in his mindnumbing corner pointincase he does a show apparently ppl follow it blind following the blind turn on your brain ppl lets be self educated human beings theres so much at stake youwe have everything to gain and nothing to loosethanks crowder for being a voice of reason in a sea of sheeple im a fan of your work in general in studio and on the streets keep up the good work man ill keep telling ppl about you and doing my best to keep notso common sense alive and well in my neighborhood too jesus help us each3
spanish my ass bunch of drunk teepee indians talking drunk shit loli side with you on basically all the topics here steve  i believe we need to control the southern border as much as the northern border were jihadist can sneak in without warning fyi the majority of influx of illegals has been those of central american countries and not mexico 
xray scannerahahahhahahhahahahhahaha
this dude needs to go to school good god
these people cross over for the american dream well im sorry my latin friends that is something reserved for americans the american dream involves laws something that is put on the back burner right off the bat for illegals
you should blur the identification she has on her blouse too if you zoom on it you can even see her name and you could be putting her in danger this is important
hes not changing anyones mind lol
the spanish guy makes the point that ive heard many liberals talk about  i just cant wrap my head around it though  which is america already has crime so whats the problem with more crime i honestly think if you subscribe to this type of thought you should be deported legal or illegal
vote 1 leroy for governor of new mexico got a problem taxem
sounds a lot like 1984  xray borders  he needs a few mastermind individuals to talk things over  fucking masterminds lmaoooooo
no boarders but microchip everyone  thats not crazy at all nope
1205 weve been wasting thousands million trillions lmao 
ever heard of the berlin wall
i just wonder if steven ever excludes anyone intelligent that speaks with him there is no way that there are so many uneducated liberals
how sad is that steven had to set up a van in a way to not get hit by some peace loving liberal
uh bruh yeah no on this one its not cost effective and geographically improbable
i am full blooded hispanic actually hispanicnative american and i as well as my family all agree that we should build the wall to prevent illlegals from coming in
we all agree that some electric wall to scan peoples tracking devices is only going to track people that have those tracking devices voluntarily right in order to use it the immigrants would have to be given the tracking devices at some sort of check point but illegal immigrants would just not get the tracking devices and walk through like normal and lets not forget that whether its electronic or physical its still a wall so his argument was completely contradictory
rocking those short shorts
haha that first lady
ive only seen rogan shut down crowder when i heard the second interview i knew he was from nm lol
that to the left has to be security
leroy for governor 3018
man that guy is into some serious science fiction shit
ju sweepey de grroun pedo i kneedeytu gess sung brroos esweepey dey ders 
i lost brain cells
1138 needs to be a meme priceless
im not mexicans im spanish my family from mexico 
xxxtentacion is still alive change my mind
well new mexico has something to look forward to with their future govenor
i wish that guy could collect his arguments better and articulate more because his mind is everywhere and i get lost i have a hard time listening to stumbling people
haha sounds like leroy is a little uneducated
the wall is a waste of money just install a wormhole that leads directly to antarctica
build the wall
please god tell me why public school has failed us like this
how bout we take all the illegals and make an army to take over mexico and adoubt the usa constitution
an xray border perfect idea
crowder is the man
guy from new mexico was a moron had no idea of the contradictions about what he was saying
hey buddy its called a visa 
lmao an xray border maybe in a hundred years
i think walls are too expensive and not effective you should try a mine field with electric fence doberman pinscher and train guns man instead of guardsman eventually illegal aliens get what they deserve running away from their country execution jk if we did that some sjw would rage and cry over it what we should do is elect a black disabled female president to allow these changes to be normal just like how obama was not talk about while deported thousands illegals off the country while trump get all the press of having officially enforced these laws
you need to delete this video and re upload it with her voice changed and more of her pixilated now
and if theres no wall how do you stop them from going around the xray machine
i am not trying to make fun of him but is the second interviewee on drugs who listens to that guys show
immigration reform  yes a stupid wall  no
if say 40 of illegal immigration is by airplane is the expense of a wall justified someone might enter the us on vacation and never leave shouldnt the effort be redirected towards methods and strategies to limit this occurrence as well as researching ways to enforce our existing infrastructure maybe the wall doesnt optimally address the immigration dilemma
mr crowder                                                      a physical wall is impractical     i feel that more information on the argument was necessary we already have some walls built many illegals are refugees from mexico and south america it is unwise to group them all as one entity with one common reason for crossing our border  if stopping drugs is the most important thing then we need to shift our understanding of addiction similar to amsterdam and focus not on incarcerating or deporting alone but rehabilitation as a solution its a more human thing to do the drug war is a large part of the problem and is often left out of the popular discussion getting back on point i agree with you on many topics just not this one the great wall of china did little against genghis khan and had an extremely high cost in both blood and construction not saying that our wall would have similar construction costs however  if we were to wisely look to the past we as a country should realize that if you cant beat them then join them similar to china and mongolia forming one united china as we know today      my argument is thislets stop the mexican american border war by creating a new partnership that will let north america unify under a similar governing rule as the euun my thoughts are that canada usa mexico guatemala honduras panama nicaragua and costa rico should create a new world super power of sorts  aimed at world preservation over conquest because the world is really not all that big and a wall across panama think canal would be way more effective in the improvement of all of north america my overall thought is that if we all play for the same team and we all support the team in different ways then we all win    god bless america and our future unite against the robots that will in our lifetime leave around 1 billion  people looking for different ways to make a living or if no humans have to work what do humans do with life everyone please feel free to poke holes in my argument otherwise whats the pointps mr crowder it may be slightly outside of your wheelhouse however please consider doing a show on robots and our future with ai and how we think we fit in consider this when we create real ai it will instantly become the smartest thing on the planet     what happens next
i like a lot of crowders stuff but this is where i have to break with him taxation is theft the idea that the general government should be driving us further into debt to build a fucking wall is about the least conservative thing imaginable yet somehow it is a pillar of modern conservatism im not saying everybody has to be ideologically pure all the time but some ideas are just bad blatantly unconstitutional and a waste of money
hey leroy was nice just really excited but his ideas were out there at least he was pretty cordial lol
undocumented immigrants commit 37 of murders i dont even have to google thatcompletely wrong
this dude is a perfect example of why we dont need any more of those people here what a fucking idiot
scientifical goodbye brain cells
pineapple doesnt belong on pizza change my mind
thank god those people are not in charge of policy but it scares the hell out of me that they can vote
oh geez an xray border im sure there are plenty of delusional people who agree that we need to all be chipped there are going to be an awful lot of hacked chips and people maimed for their chips when that happens go green though go green eyeroll
ive been thinking about this for 3 years ive come up with a portal stargate invention that doesnt exist that criminals will totally want to use
good lord how can you talk to these people
steven please tell me where you get your statistics so i can shove it to these leftists  the fbi does not differentiate between citizens and legalillegal immigrants in their crime charts so i need ways to get these stats
cowardsyelling aggressive obscenities and insults from a distance yet they wont engage in the debatethey all seem to act the same  traits of a cult
thatthat might have been the dumbest person on the planet
you should do a part two in a college campus as a mexican citizenamerican citizen i lived over there for almost 14 years  would like to engage with you in a wall conversation i have pretty understanding of points coming from both wall sides perspectives
im more for a probation program allow them to stay under heavy or moderate surveillance for a year or two and if they havent committed any sort of crime within that time and if they are able to get some nonlatin citizens to give them character references they will be granted citizenship oh and uh also tone it down a bit on the welfare
they should really replace the pipes in flint michigan before they start building a wall
trying to look for the 37 of illigals committing crimes that he is talking about and i cant find any source that validates his claim does anyone else have a source
855 this guys a moron he just wants open borders but he doesnt have the balls to say it pathetic
just thought id leave a few comments regarding some of the things ive seen on louder with crowderwarning really long posts and many things to trigger many people  if you think youre going to be offended and you read this anyway you deserve whatever happens to you1 in response to there are only 2 genders  change my mindi can agree with steven that there are only 2 genders female and male  however that does not mean that it is a binary discussion  i disagree with the assertion that it is an entire spectrum as some have argued but i am both intellectually and morally compelled to accept more than just one or the other  even steven can admit that there is a small percentage of people with biologically provable conditions that classify them as intersex  they may present as primarily male or female but they are in fact a separate category that at a biological and purely scientific level is both  right there ive proven that there are only 2 genders but three separate optionsand i know im going to trigger a great many people when i point this out not that i care but i feel that any postop trans person falls into a fourth category  we have one the other both and the fourth category none  while i support most people in the lgb community yes i shortened it on purpose i think the entire concept of trans is delusional and selfdestructive  this is not some transphobic rant  this is me saying that i believe the core concepts that trans people defend so strongly and hold so dearly to are poorly thought out logically unsound and show a dangerous lack of critical thinking  ive heard the arguments ive read the data ive heard the rhetoric and accusations directed at anyone who doesnt agreeand im not impressed  im not saying im definitely right  im just saying youre going to have to come up with something a lot better than what you have so far to convince me youre not wrong
1137 please dont become the governor of new mexico
typical conservative thoughti hate taxes and dont trust the govt so lets spent tax money on an impossibly big wall and trust the govt to actually be competent to secure the border lol
lets see here 115 billion a year to maintain illegal immigrants and do nothing while this increases per year by a few billion or stop this rising cost by investing in a democrat party estimate of the wall costing 70billion dollar wall once and 115 million yearly estimate for maintenance  you choose
a wall that is built to keep people out can also be used to keep people in ron paul
at lease those two had the balls to sit down and try to have a conversation all the people driving by and yelling are braindead
does that mexican actually expect us to believe that hes not mexican
lol this is the guy from the meme
that guy was a freakin idiot go through x ray scanners with no wall to force them into a choke point ok lets see how well that works out for ya
this was painfuly stupidbrother i wish i could argue with you about this one
this guy from new mexico does not get that illegals are crossing where ever they want  if they came at the border or did not overstay visas it would not be illegal
central america is a 3rd world shit hole mexico is a failed state ran by cartels imho i dont just want a wall i want a 3 mile no mans land equipped with land mines and machine gun nests
everything really feels like a bandaid perhaps if mexico was a better place there would not be so many illegals the drug cartels practically run mexico if mexico legalized drugs wouldnt it just put drug cartels out of business and bring in massive revenue to mexico make mexico great again
his face at the end hahaha im pretty sure leroy has been playing with too many xray machines
the woman at the beginning was bizarre but she was clearly in fear of the illegals around her bringing dodgy crime to her immediate surrounds ironic
the new mexican is right
i really feel sorry for the first person the woman but the second is a real idiot
frist off no god fuck no does this guy know what the hell he is advocating for the government been able to track you via chip or some sort of id card that is asking for trouble in the authoritarian disotpia sense not to mention it would violation the 4th amendment look if chossing to build a wall or have uncle sam track me down like cattle is the only solutions we have ill take the wall please with that aside what the lady said is true look a of these illegals dont respect the law or anyone else who is not of their fold even other mexicans this is the same problems blacks had with the north and south with the southern blacks resenting the northern blacks because they were doing well for themselves when people say why we should build that wall all i have to say is this the mexican government is corrupt that is common knowledge the problem is every time discontent and unsettlement rises people tend to runaway from the problems and just like in real life nothing changes from running away so when you have a huge ass wall to prevent you from running away you have one of two options you fight an start a revolution to change the system or keep living in shit but it let it be know that a man can only take so much shit before he starts pushing back so yeah i think we need that wall for both americans and mexicans sake this immigration problem which was start by bill clintons ineptitude needs to end
such a big important topic need a lot more taking about becoming disappointed with these change my mind videos
the wall should not be built unless the american government pays for it the mexican government is know for being one of the worlds most corrupt governments so if you make them pay the exorbitant amount of money required to erect that wall mexico will either be in debt with the american government or the country will suffer from a crisis that will result in a larger number of people trying to get into the us the problem must be solved from its roots the amount of insecurity in mexico and the inefficient educational system if the us were to invest the money that would be invested into the wall into making sure the mexican people dont get involved in the drug business and get a better education i know that it is not the americans responsibility but the mexican government sucks at its job the number of illegal immigrants would dramatically fall
it did surprise me to hear that legal immigrants are more intimidated into not reporting crimes by illegal immigrants in their neighborhood
whats more cost effective though continuing to house illegal immigrants in anything besides a tent city they are multiplying everyday by the 100s or building a wall to keep them from coming over the wall would eventually pay for itself maybe in 10 years but who am i fucking kidding next democratic president will just spend trillions of dollars to dismantle the wall and have open boarders
that look at the end of the video was entirely predictable  wow  that dude was a piece of work
excellent audio this time
wow the second person hasnt really thought this through its painful listening to him
how do people seriously think that the wall is to keep out legal mexican immigrants how many people actually know what trump is trying to achieve with the wall
simply crossing the border illegally makes you a criminal it shouldnt matter if these guys are hardworking or not they still committed a crime and need to be punished for it
i dont do this for the views change my mind
did anyone notice he is wearing a walther shirt
i do not understand why some people are against a border wall or border fence or whatever we could build there1 any country around the world especially those driven by communism  socialism have border installations that they sure as shit guard like no ones business so nobody can come in unnoticed or gets out unnoticed2 expenses any federal installation that we have in our country has a wall or fence or what have you so nobody can enter unnoticed they guard those too and all combined is pretty much the length of our border too but our international border is out of question  why 3 and finally for those doubtersevery tried to get unnoticed into area 51  yeah i didnt think so many tried and all got caught there is your best example of border security 4 a country without a border is no country it is just a patch of land for anyone to take
the wall wont change shit build it and mexico will pay for it idiots
scientifical
please build a big ass wall trump
steven this is my opinion i welcome you to discuss our differences and i challenge you to change my mindliberals fuckkkkkk youuuuuuu as they drive by
shes lucky she wasnt in mexico because her head would have got decapitated
dude if that guy says like one more time
its almost always the white elitist liberals incapable of articulating anything of substance who resort to parroting the same one to two word pejoratives of fuck you racist bigot etc and its usually those that virtue signal the most that are the most morally void with the most to hide race is always on their mind because they are true racists their welfare mindset for people of color is the grandest form of condescension
more power to the states and shrink the federal government change my mind
awe john is precious
dude this guys is fucking retarded   im against the wall and this dude really had switching sides for his dumb statements im fine with a border but not a wall tbh i dont really mind
that leeroy person was saying his family has been in new mexico since the 1500s but says he isnt mexican what the hell does he not know the history of new mexico
im at the 720 mark and i dont know if ill be able to finish because im dying trying to listen to this guys verbal diarrhea its just amazing that people sit down to debate and then cant construct a single coherent sentence or pointjust ramblings
illegal immigrants pump 13 billion dollars into tax revenue however they consume 130 billion dollars of tax revenue if it were the other way around the argument would be valid
oh my goodness  he wants to electrically tag everyone so that the government knows where each person is in town  what are we  the governments pets
where are people getting that mexico should pay for the wall first of all what money does mexico have and second it was americas idea
1317 
leroy doesnt support borders or immigration enforcement but he wants them all to be microchipped and tracked by xray machines they would also have to explain the reason they go anywhere lmao this dude is ridiculous
oh hell no what is this 1984 no xray id tags microchip mumbo jumbo
whad up with leroy 0
i think the xray sort of tagging check points sounds really cool and possibly would be good for a while but im afraid it would give the government way too much power seems like something from a movie that ends with revolutionaries trying to abolish it
crowder where are you getting these statistics those facts are blatantly false  these falsehoods make have any source of discourse nearly impossible by cherry pick stats and failing to look further into blog posts like you often do using climate change you only weaken your validity httpswwwnprorg20180502607652253studiessayillegalimmigrationdoesnotincreaseviolentcrime httpswwwwashingtonpostcomnewsfactcheckerwp20180118trumpsclaimthatimmigrantsbringtremendouscrimeisstillwrongnoredirectonutmterm6acdc8f2f929
king of the dumbasses here since 1550 yeah right 500 years and no spanish or american accent whatsoever
my fucking brain hurts after listening to this autistic thumb
lets make laws with no way to enforce them is what the second person said pretty much
you know what forget the wall im all about this xray border we could set it up with our dirtpowered construction equipment and could pay for it with the candles that we use as currency
omg build the wallkeep out more mouth breathersdangggg
fuck you leroy jenkins
that guy literally made me feel dumber than before i watched this video impressive
i wish people would come on here who could better express their opinion personally i am 100 against the wall i feel it is an unnecessary expense people who will really want to come over here will find a way the conditions down there can be bad enough that people wont stop most people who come from mexico illegally arent doing it to sell and distribute drugs or commit other crimes most want to come to have a better life and i dont see a problem with that i have grown up in a area with quite a few illegal immigrants and you learn to sympathize i think we sometimes forget that they are people as well its easy to sit back and say you shouldnt be here go back to where you came from until you are legal when you dont understand what some go through it can take years for people to get accepted to live here legally and many dont have that much time now am i saying everyone come over illegally no i wish everyone could come over legally but sadly thats not always an option
god damn americans are the most guallable people on earth
xray wall
release despacito 2  change my mind
how does this guy intended to taxe illegal citizens they are criminals theyre not gonna pay taxes
i feel like the people who crowder spoke to in this video were very uneducated in this topic and there are so many other people who would have argued this point better if given the chance
the few people i know out of the 13 million of them are really nice people
hipster doofus build the wall with your ass bitch well if i could literally shit bricks i would honey
scientifical xray gate so many stupid opinions
hipster doofus build the wall with your ass bitch well if i could literally shit bricks i would honey
im guessing leroy also believes plants crave electrolytes
omg can someone tell that guy that he interviewed to please go back to school what is he even talking about lmao he is all over the place has no idea on statistics or anything else that came out of his mouth for that matter scan people make them go through xray machines lmao im dying here 
waste american tax dollars and build a wall a wall a walla wall really a wall hmmmyes a wall will stop someone from crossing the border isnt this 2018 i mean thats something a caveman would do to prevent this
you have a lot of patience steven i dont think i could even make it through one convo with the mind numbingly moronic and uninformed people you talk to
utter stupidity at its finest
you interviewed nothing but stupid people interview me instead what city you do this
screw the wall lets just conquer the world
hahahhahaah that look was the best
i guess the only way to make a xmachine big enough is nuclear that will solve everything
track people with tech we miss you mr orwell
the guy seems lost and confused yes lets spend more for xrays and id implants this guy watches too many movies
so build an xray scanner across the southern us border oooookkkkk
in highschool i was a globalist i believed borders were causing our world problems but its the peopl inside those borders that cause problems removing the lines on our maps just makes all the problems come together and spread out of control key word is control and you cant control your internal issues if theres no distinction between external and internal
can you please come to sdsu
build the fucking wall
build the damn wall deport all illegals
an xray border will catch them
build the wall illegal mmigrants  are illegal thats a crime im mexican and i dont want all of those illegal immigrants coming from central and south america too they dont pay taxes and the majority are criminals lets build a wall north and south you americans have the right and should build a wall  also we treat the immigrants worse than you do so it is hypocrite to complain about how you treat illegals
would you mind coming to mexico to talk about to this
has anyone ever been able to change this guys mind
people do realize he could be spanish and have been born around mexicans so hes picked up on their accent 
damn i wish he had come across smarter people wtf
love you come to appalachian state
maybe im late into this conversation but isnt  there a wall between guatemala and mexico
does steven have even one opinion thats not hardcore right winger in contrast im in the middle and possess ideologies that are from the right and left eg proself defense prochoice etc its worrying when a persons ideology is so predictable furthermore its not good to be in line with someone like trump whose intelligence is sadly lacking for me i dont support the wall walls remind me of dictatorship authoritarianism and such things the right supports it for emotional reasons logically it cant stop illegal immigration it wont its a status symbol made by white people to support isolation for a country built on taking someone elses land
that mexican non mexican is super incoherent
maybe mexicans should try and fix their country just an idea
this title isnt even coherent
oh damn 
seriously i hope that guy doesnt have a large audience haha
so we need to micro chip everyone and give the government the power to see where we are all the time
did any of my fellow car guys spot the volkswagen golf r32 700
100 of illegal immigrants have broken a law thats what makes them illegal in the first place
wow you interview real rocket surgeons
haha that stare
so how will the wall stop planes and boats
i dont support the building of the wall but the second dude was hilarious i dont know how steve kept a straight face haha
i like the guys id about tagging everyone that comes by  so instead of a border wall an automated turret system that fires rfid tags into their ass as soon as they pass the border  if the tag hits the body it uses the bodys energy to transmit a signal to a satellite that generates an id tag  freaking awesome
you should get a tv show crowder
leroy dumb as hell listening to him saying we can have the people that arent supposed to be here and dont wanna be registered be registered
an xray boarder ya know i plan on being the mayor of new mexico 
x ray wall
what is stupid especially to trump votersthere is already a wall barrier installedshows many of them dont even live at the borderjust believe any rhetoric a politician says
nice to see a fellow spaniard on here who also had ancestors that were born in mexico
just watched an 8 minute ad for you 3
crowders face at the end of that video god damn
this is why we need the wall not necessarily because it acts as a physical buffer but that it represents a statement of you will not enter unless we say soso the only argument i can have against the wall and be something i can support isi am against building the wall because it is not what we need to do i think trumps initiative and drive are correct that illegals and especially criminals need to be vetted a physical wall is not how to deal with this i think limited intervention is necessary that the usa needs to turn central america into a territory and fix all of its issues by indoctrinating and expanding american cultural influence basically manifest destiny to panama but the goal isnt more states but to observe a territory until it proves it can function without outside influence or corruption then like with every territory either grant its independence or make it a protectorate immortal like puerto ricoin short a wall of fire and lead not a border walli do concede that this is a much more radical idea and one that will be met with harsh resistance as many people corrupt or innocent will view this as an act of aggression and a destruction of liberty if not their way of life
try again at san antonio or some more populated area i want to hear other informed reasons on how they defend law breaking humans
if the mexican americans here as legal citizens have any sense at all they would want us to do everything necessary to keep america from turning into another hthole country like mexico  if they love mexico so dmn muchgo back to mexico
what a fucktard
make more of these
prestige worldwide changemymind
walls dont seem that great at keeping people out now a no mans lands with minefields barbwire snipers machine guns and tanks are far more of a deterrent it seems
hey steven crowder i feel like a lot of people on your channel are missing the point of series i dont believe that you 100 stand behind some of the controversial topics that you discuss i believe that the point of your channel is to create a space where people can discuss these controversial topics without feeling like theyre being discriminated against for their opinions i would love to have an opportunity to talk and hear out some of the opinionsbeliefs that you talk about on your channel i would like to make it clear that i dont agree with about every single controversial topic you talk about on your channel however i think you give a platform for people to talk freely about things that are not normally accepted about in society i dont want to change your mind but i would love to have an opportunity to talk to you freely without prejudice or discrimination about why i disagree with you on most of these topics i think that this platform shouldnt be captioned with change my mind but with open my mind i dont know who you are and what you really think about these topics but i would love to understand why some people like yourself think the way that you do im trying to be as nonpartisan and open minded as i can as much as i disagree with the things you talk about please contact me and change my mind on some of these topics you choose to talk so freely about
bro i love change my mind but id prefer the minimal edited segments with no transitions or cuts to from the actual talki think its a more fair way to actually seem as if you the won the argument
mexico is part of north america which means mexicans have more right to be here than you white trash
i wouldve loved to have sat down with steven for this one i understand why a wall is wanted but i feel that this is only a bandage that will not last in the long run we need to attack the source crack down on businesses that hire illegal immigrants and dont allow the mothers to staywhen they have a baby here put the children up for adoption there are plenty of potential parents out there who would take them in and that would scare the life out of the mothers with the thought of losing their children it sounds terrible but we need to give them consequences makes one think twice about what theyre doing
that spanish guy whos not mexican and his family been in new mexico since the 1550s around there is a fucking joke educate yourself my brother and stop making us look bad out there this is coming from a first generation immigrant hispanic man
id like to point out that the real reason that the left opposes border security and wants illegal immigration is because illegal aliens are counted in the census which results in states with large illegal populations getting more electoral votes and seats in the house of representatives  this is why those democratrun states are declaring sanctuaries  over 70 of the illegal population lives in blue states so even when illegals arent actively voting in our elections they are still influencing our entire election process just by being herethe next census takes place in 2020 and blue states are going to get more seats and more votes distributed to them  make sure to vote in the midterms get as many democrats out of office as possible and help president trump  fix our illegal immigration problem  as the propagandists in the news say this is very dangerous to our democracy
well my biggest reason against the wall is the financial reason and the sheer cost of building a wall of that size i think there are a lot more effective ways to combat illegal immigration which makes the concept of a wall just stupid
the wall will work  the perfect example is the border fence in san diego  all the data is there to support it
you know how illegals are criminalsdo you really think theyll follow the law when the wall is builtnothe wall wouldnt work and wouldnt be that easy considering we have rivers and the ocean that people can swim to get hereplusthe wall would hurt our ecosystem and change migration routesconservatives constantly give shit about people crossing here illegally butthey dont want make the path to citizenship easierplus whos going to pay for the wall
the guy in the white shirtmaybe he was born with it maybe its methamphetamine
first off i dont want my tax money going towards a wall that is not gona stop illegals nor drugs its useless and its a weight on our economy we already have debt now this fucking guy wants to spend it on this 
do you guys think itd work for the government to lean really heavy on companies that hire illegals like trying to track down every illegal migrant runnin around is like trying to swat individual flies in a swarm if you could make hiring them so unprofitable that youd get companies ratting each other out to hurt their competitors then now you have business working to solve the problem instead of increase it
building a wall definitely needs to be scientifical
nothing annoys me more than showing the worsts example of the other side both sides do it we get it chowder has had some really good interviews that changed my mind on some subjects but this is just pandering to your base and yes i meant chowder
illegal undocumented immigrantsjust tax themillegal undocumented immigrants
do whites know theyre also immigrants living on indian land lol who are they calling immigrants 
okay a rantmy latefather who was a hard man to live with would be or is raging in his grave because he loved the us he and my mom came to the us legally from honduras in the early 1960s to live a better life of their own and have much better opportunities for themselves and raising a family so that me and my brother could have the freedom to be whatever we wanted me and my father lived with racism only when we moved to louisiana in 1971 and lived there for 7 long years but i would never judge others or the whole south with that redneck mentality that we dealt with just about everyday me in school by black white and cajun people and teachers and my father got into fights at the shipyards as a welder we came back to california and had a much better life the experience we lived in the south did not make us hate southerners or hate people of color or make us angry to blame others for the hate we dealt with my father and mother worked damned hard to live in better homes and safer communities that were multicultural working class cities my papa instilled in us that if we wanted something we had to go get it with hard work and let nothing deter us from our dreams no blame no excuses it was up to us im not living the high life i hate my current 9 to 5 job had success in the past designing video games and trying to get back into film production even had a bout with homelessness for a year and a half in the late 90s    but its up to me to get up and kick the obstacles out of the way life is hard but each of us has to do what we have to without taking advantage of people and have ethics morals and common decency to find success and peace of mindwe were not criminals nor did we hang out with any i feel for that 1st woman she feels and deals with the danger and doesnt want to see her community deteriorate ive seen cities ive lived in the past in california fall into corruption from their officials and those allowed to live in their communities see videos for the city council of the city cudahy in la countyto the statistics the 2nd young man wants this is from mexicos citizens council for public securitys annual ranking of the worlds most violent cities httpwwwbusinessinsidercommostviolentcitiesintheworld20183our culture has been power hungry corrupt and violent but what culture hasnt since before christ and leaving the shores of spain italy portugal and coming across the americas my family comes from 25 on that list it was 1 in 2015 it wasnt like that before the 70s but the regimes and cartels have gotten worse and corrupted mexico again if these countries are soo great why come here to the us and then see latinohispanic radical groups spreading propaganda and chanting america was never great then why did your parents come here or telling socalled whites  go back to europe well you people may need to come with us where is your last names fromi wasnt born in europe even though im of spanish  italian heritage so where do i go back south central la pomona lapuente el paso phoenix houston new orleans the bronx miamiwhat about those mexicans that mingled with the spanish and native tribes  what about those californios or the tejanos that fought with the us militias during the alamo sorry for the history lessonrant but all this rhetoric and narratives that many of these latinos spout or believe in look up the history of spanishmexicans and native tribes in the spanish territories would make my father rage and weep why keep separating and segregating yourselves from the rest of us and obey the laws and principles of our for everyone constitution no one or my parents grandparents or myself persecuted killed or enslaved any race for the past 75 years whoever did in my own family    theyre dead and gonestand in line become a citizen so you wont have to worry about being deported whats not to understand
heres what i would do i have put no thought into how to implement this
can you please do a longer segment on this on a college campus next school year
that guy sounded intelligent by the way he way talking but if you actually listen to what hes saying he has no idea what hes talking about just make them legal is a stupid argument dismisses statistics doesnt actually know any recent facts or information and thinks in 510 years borders are going to be a thing of the past what lmao actually so dumb
lol
the xray border not a wall
this dude had to be high
well its time for me to make some more enemiesso much of most peoples political beliefs including among peoplewho consider themselves to be profreedom stems from falseassumptions and from the belief in that mythical beast calledauthoritywe now scoff at the old belief in the divine right of kings thenotion that by an accident of birth someone had more rights thanother people and had the right to forcibly control those otherpeople silly huh well that ridiculous belief is back and itscalled illegal immigrationhow exactly does someone born several thousands miles away inalaska have an inherent right to stand in el paso texas butsomeone born in ciudad juarez just across the river doesntwithout special permission from the tyrants in washingtona lot changes when you lose the selfcontradictory belief ingovernment a lot of concepts you accepted as selfevidentevaporate such as country borders citizenship patriotism andnationalism take for example that imaginary line between mexicoand the us what is it how did it get there it is the boundarybetween the dirt which one set of tyrants claims the right to ruleand the dirt which another set of tyrants claims the right to ruleyou can wave the flag all you want and talk about your countryand patriotism but the fact is country boundaries are basedentirely upon the inherently bogus arbitrary claims of the rightto rule made by various megalomaniacsyou have no more right to be here than someone born in zimbabweor budapest or anywhere else therefore you have no right to useforce to stop them from coming here nor can you delegate tosomeone else the right to do so to put it as bluntly as i can allimmigration laws are 100 illegitimate unjustifiable violenceall of them in every country under any circumstancesyou can wave laws around wave the constitution around and makegeneralizations all you want but if you forcibly stop someone whoonly wants to walk from one piece of dirt to another you are theone initiating violence you are the bad guy if on the otherhand the piece of dirt he wants to walk on is your own personalproperty you have the right to keep him off but unless youbelieve you personally own this entire country that cannotpossibly justify any immigration lawsoddly as often happens in the case of immigration freedom getsthe blame for problems caused by tyranny but those dang mexicanscome over here and get public benefits and welfare and freeschooling so which is the problem them walking over an invisibleline or your governmentconsisting entirely of americansforcibly robbing one person to give a handout to someone elseif someone accepts stolen property thats bad and its badregardless of where the person was born or what imaginary lines hehas walked over so why do americans whine about illegals gettinggovernment benefits more than they do about the millions ofamerican parasites doing the same thing i wont even bothergetting into the actual statistics on which demographic groups getmore government goodies and which produce more for the economybecause its beside the pointand how backwards and fascist is it to have the attitude of wellyou might apply for government handouts so were going to useforce to keep you out of this country guilty until proveninnocent yep those who want to come here legally have to go togreat lengths to prove that they will be productive and not adrain on society hilariously they have to prove this to peoplein government who themselves are nothing but a drain onsocietymind you im not saying i agree with amnesty for illegals theonly reason i dont however is that the people who have no rightto stop people from coming here also have no right to give thempermission to come here which is what amnesty means people bornon this planet or on any others for that matter have the rightto come here just as much as you have the right to be here its alittle funny that so many people whose grandparents came here fromeurope africa asia and so on are now whining that mexicans haveno right to be on this piece of dirt the americans indians areprobably getting a chuckle out of that and dont whine about somedoing it legally because that makes exactly no difference whenit comes to morality the morality of an act does not depend uponwhether politicians have given it their blessing via legislationas ive said before the world looks very different when not viewedthrough authoritycolored glasses on one hand many things get alot simpler on the other hand you lose the intellectual copoutof mass violence via government intervention as the defaultsolution to all problems whether it be poverty crime illiteracysubstance abuse or even those dadburn furriners coming heredeal with them without initiating violence or stop pretending tobe profreedomsincerelylarken rosewwwlarkenrosecom
wow this gave me an aneurism
the look on your face at the end was hilariously
walls turn into prisons real quick
that poor woman
transferring to tcu  hope i come across you next year
you left the first womans name tag clear should probably blur
go on any conservative town global warming is real change my mind vaccines dont cause autism change my mind america does have a problem with mass shootings change my mind crowder fans as delusional as crowder is about being a comedian
so build the startrek xray machine would every illegal would comply on getting scanned prior to entering the answer is noillegals and criminals by definition means they are outlaw and they think they shouldnt answer for their actions just like the rest
ive never thought about making them all lrgal citezens youd havr to do censuses like every day so itd create jobs idk not my stance per usual but i dont hate it
doesnt anyone feel bad for people who come to america for asylum from the dangerous places that they live why doesnt anyone want to help them
how the heck u kept a straight face that was funny you couldnt even write that
he had a chance to make some change for god and he didnt know what to do
wow go ahead and tag mexicans like cattle or dogsthis guy is off his rocker  i remember when a dictator tagged people and sent them to gas chambersbut hey what could possibly go wrong putting tags and rfid chips into humans
stop the welfare stop the immigration medical shouldnt be free or education also these illegals are here because americans are employing them you are being betrayed by your own countrymen fuck the wall they tried it germany they got one in israel walls suck
great ending
i was raised in canadaah so thats why is so polite lol
please film a second change my mind build a boarder  we love you at missouri state university
the only argument against the wall is that its extremely expensive and a waste of money
and that kids is why you dont do drugs
that guy is talking about nwo and one world government
you did not blur this womans face enough what the fuck she probably is going to actually go and report those people she was talking about because she seemed like she genuinely cared about her community and if they find this video i feel like they will know exactly who she is holy fuck man you didnt even blur her voice or her id card she had on her chest i would know who she was if she were living in my apartment if i saw this video immediately this is not okay crowder im serious i dont even think she understands how big your channel is on youtube because she leaned over and whispered that to you seemingly in confidence that you were the only one who would be hearing it please take this video down and edit her identity out of it a lot more than it is now please
it doesnt really matter to me being from canada but i can understand a wall i mean china built one thousands of years ago and they still dont have any mexicans
he is talking about some high tech kind of stuff that is pretty amazing something maybe like in total recall
all lives matter change my mind
that guy being interviewed is the most unintelligent and uninformed person i have ever seen
lol the he thinks we should tag the immigrants like dogs pretty sure that could fall under the human rights violation umbrella
leans in to whisper some secrets about illegal activities crowder sticks microphone to her face
last i heard the wall by trumps campaign vision is crazy expensive and would take a very long time and cross many private boundariesbut now trump knows that and backed down from the full wall ideaeven he doesnt want to build the full wall change his mind
does anyone know where he got his 37 of murders are commit by illegals that just seems way to high to be believable
if illegal immigrants arent following rules now what makes this guy think theyll follow the rules once his xray scanner system starts haha
fucking painful the second guy was considerate but woefully uneducated and ignorant we just make them citizens and tax them tax what they arent making any damn money to tax the vast majority of the ones that have skills to gain them employment are getting work visas or are immigrating permanently the normal way they arent fucking hopping the fence tax them jesus christ 
oh so we just make them legal a citizen and tax them so im pretty sure that if they came to america legally that would have happened already
the wall just got 10 feet higher
so this dude is asking for a dog tracker chip in every mexicans coming through the border
lol got a crowder ad
ms13 the cartel surenos yea dont see those mexican gangs doing drugs cuz what else do gangs do for loads of cash they probably sell starwars toys for their gang related activities in america
i always hear people say that illegals will go over or under the wall but i dont believe that those people actually thought over their own arguments the problem with going over the wall is that most of the illegals that would attempt to scale the wall would need to be in excellent physical condition and this fact already reduces the number of people that are able to attempt to cross into the us next those people will need to bring some supplies over the wall which will also be very difficult even for a person in excellent physical condition this also takes a considerable length of time and if there is also surveillance on the wall boarder patrol will easily be able to catch them before they can enterthe tunnel argument is laughabledrug trafficking is the most profitable use for a tunnel and so that will constitute the majority of the use of the tunnel the drug cartels would not want to risk their investment of the tunnel on an enormous number of people that have no loyalties to the cartel other benefits of that model includes the fact that if the drugs are intercepted they will offer no clues as to where the tunnel is and the people transporting the drugs will often times not even know where the tunnel as a way to insure that the tunnel will not be found the drivers will only be told where the car that they are asked to drive is
1984 totalitarian orwellian society is what that commie wants  ffs  xray laser tagging wall  lol  tag m and taxm  xd
xray borders 
the guy with the recorder is like a walking breathing social media comment
wow the city of new mexico is in for a rocky future
scientifical
i felt bad for the first woman who was a legal immigrant
according to the cms over 23 of illegal immigration comes from those who enter the us legally with a green card and simply overstay it  i dont think a wall is worth it when it would only potentially stop less than 13 of illegal immigration
one of the most common arguments ive heard against the wall or security measures in general is its too hard to get into the country legallyseems like an irrelevant and unintelligent argument to me
illegal immigrants commit 37 percent of of the murders
i dont see how building the wall would stop illegal immigration as the wall would just take away one option many illegal immigrants can come over legally and just stay after their visas run out or come over by boat also how would you guard something of that size to keep it from getting tampered with to me it just seems that it just simply is not worth the cost and would just be a waste of time resources brain power something many of us are lacking these days  and of course tax money which i would rather see go twords our schools and infrastructure
the second guy made my day i literally died in laughter
the majority of south and central american immigrants legal are unemployed not just for their first few years but even after 25 years in the country the majority remain unemployed whereas euopean and asian immigrants have an unemplyement rate below that of us citizens
how about never get two mics for this segment change my mind
digital tags so he wants to microchip immigrants way to many scifi movies
lets face it the second guy was about to say indivegatables instead of individuals lol
the best wall of all  everify
445 roll tribe
was that guy retarded
i dont think we should build a wall despite being republican 1  it is a waste of money where will we get this money from2 it wont have much effect most immigrants dont scale the border they overstay their pass while visiting 3 it only creates further tension and division between us and mexico 4 the liberals are going to protest this day and night causing problems burning and breaking things etc so building a wall is a useless idea in my opinion and is just a waste of time effort and money with too many consequences to be worth it
wow this guy is a soup sanwichjust a mess  all over the place x ray boarder who will pay for this shit thats expensive broway more so than a concrete wall
some people dont want a wall just so they dont have to agree with trumppricks
you have to do this topic again
im a liberal and i couldnt listen to the spanish guy without cringing
dude def watched reporte de minrity  a few too many times
you know what he changed my mind an xray wall sounds way cooler than a boring old concrete one
g  o      g  r  e  e  n      g  l  o  b  a  l
just wow this guy has a firm grasp dont he now  how do you keep from cracking up there steve
illigal imigration seems to be a isue yet a wall seems extremely ineficient ofa solution
i get the idea the hopeful governor but ive still got a few hangups 1 were still building something across the whole border 2 if there isnt a physical id were talking chipping people which means we have to involuntarily echip people which means wed have to chip everyone
i dont what the scientifical word is   these are the people who are defending the opposition they cant even properly talk
word of the dayscientifical
i lost brain cells listening to this guy
so sad  these dumb fuck s are just puppet voters they have  no clue about facts or anything  just ramble buckshot they have been spoon fed
i could change your mind first of all its probly a bad thing to say that we will build a wall that will take 20 years to do unless you trashed millions perhaps billions are there any plans yet proposing costs or are we assuming trump will get mexico to pay for it im against the wall because the drugs and weapons are much more commonly dished out to populations of civilians by big pharma and weapons dealers once we consider the act of using a drug like the prescription drugs as being wrong as a moral stand point and we re visit the statistical data to include consideration of the real  of drugs being sold to the people we do that we see we have a much bigger internal issue than a wall im all for keeping our at15s but buddy is it not true every rampage sprit shooter is on psychoactive drugs every single last one of them is it columbias cocaine that seems to be a common thread among sprit shooters or is it psychoactive drugs sold by the faction flying under the flag and protection of law whos the bigger problem get to the root of school shootings or deal with the beans
where does this 37 of murders are illegals come from i cant find any evidence of this
so assuming the wall is an effective strategy in preventing illegal immigration from central and south america the real question then is who would pay for it trump stated mexico would however they said they wont so then should the us taxpayer still pay for it would pro trumpers still consider that a victory or a renege
1053 so the spanish guy just wants a higher tech borderalso scientifical lmao
these people are fucking illiterate  they literally dont get it  they cant
the nm governor hasnt thought at all
wow that last guy was painful to listen to
i just lost brain cells because of the guy with the camera
i love that she has that plant
im a pencil change my mind
gotta say steven been a little disappointed with a few of the last change my minds you havent been really challenging their positions admittedly i havent gotten a chance to watch the whole of the latest 2 genders but for example when you were on campus discussing socialism you let the kid make his talking points pointed them out in your handbook and sent him on his way with the wall you let this guy just talk and talk but dont challenge his points how do we tax them what entry points if there are no borders etcweve heard all of these talking points before theyre nothing new to us imo what really made this show shine was you changing their minds not the other way aroundedit having gotten to watch the whole of 2 genders pt 2 that was phenomenal you countered points and challenged
dude had 3 years to think about it and thats the best idea he could come up with
wow this guy is a fuckn genius tag people scientifical we cant stop it but no wall
that guy is the male immigrant version of a dumb blonde
man the media has totally succeeded is making total idiots of the populationthese idiots read some facebook feeds and a few min of cnn and boom thats all it takesour generation is total freaking garbage millennial gen
who needs a wall the cages for children are working fine while we waste tax dollars prosecuting people that will be deported anyway
build that wall
walls never work and never last   great wall of china built for defense to keep criminals out in time it fell   berlin wall built to separate two governing parties who thought criminal of the other and it fell   so all the motivation now would be to use tax payers money for fat greedy politicians
as soon as this dude opened his mouth i knew he was from new mexico
id really like to see you debate someone who actually knows what theyre talking about most of these people seem borderline retarded
worst interviews ever
just call this talking to idiots
you know theyre all sub 80 iq right
i guess i am surprised that you are for the wall it seems inhumane to me
word of the day scientifical adj a word used by morons to sound more intelligent than another person who has them on the spot i am extremely more scientifical than you
50 of people are below 100 iq this women is in that category
make a part 2
these people are straight up morons
lool second guy on some good sniff
white tshirt guy seems smart enough until he started saying the stuff about no boarders in the future and that with technology people will be travelling super fast or whatever he said i think he watches too much tv how much faster can people travel unless star trek is actually real and we can beamtransport ourselves
isnt there movies about numbering people and past history  that shows they number people to get rid of freedoms
the earth is round change my mind
wow the stupid
scientifical
although im against building an even bigger wall than we already have the people opposing the wall cleary dont have their facts in order if you just want to make people pass the exam to become a us citizen then youre just pushing people through and thinking its gonna work out i dont feel like extending the existing wall will do much but i also feel that these opposing ideas are useless and not well thought out
mexico has a southern border wall you cant tax a illegal because they have noid s you cant do shit but put them in jail and use tax  to feed and house them we dont send mexico the bill to house and feed all the illegals from that country we need to shoot to kill the drug smugglers and the coyote people smugglers bomb their tunnels and know routes of travel shoot to kill and the message will get across and it will stop
globalists would love that guys plans
second interview is coked out
well everybody knows that if you try to build a wall mongolians are gonna come and tear it down
if i understood correctly what leroy was saying he was basically proposing that we microchip people like dogs so that big brother government can monitor people going in and out of the country i think that the cost of maintain such a project would exceed that of making a structure that would chanel in and out flow of individuals to specific locations
heres your answerthe wall is not cost effective in the end
biggest reason why not to build the wall is because of the environmental disruption it would cause
i definitely lost a few brain cells listening to this
hey man big fan of your show but man oh man these two had some real weird arguments i personally dont support a wall but i also dont support the arguments these guys proposed i  immigrated into this country and i know it was really difficult i dont want to write out some crazy essay for the comment trolls but i support your opinion and i hope someone brought some real conversation to the table because as someone who has been involved in the immigration system i gotta say man its not as easy as most people think either way thanks for putting out a platform for conversation keep up the great work maybe ill see you in boston someday wether is one of the many many topics we agree on or one of the few we dont
scientifical
do people know that illegal immigrants dont work tax paying jobs they have kids so they can get 5 years or what ever it is to stay  do people know we pay them money out of our taxes for food stamps and other aid
you should do this again
lol i wanna be a state governor but i dont know what it takes to be a citizen nowadays and its been a few months since ive kept up with the news
shes snitching lol
yeah just make them citizens  just pass them on their test weve already lower the standard for testing in this country and they hire people who dont even qualify for the job how is that working out for his right now this guy doesnt understand that if you give illegal immigrants your job then what job are you going to get if youre already at a low paying job and they hire someone to pay them less what does that tell you next thing theyre going to tell you to go to college and get a degree so you can get a better job but then theyre going to give those people who are illegal immigrants free pass to free education while you have to pay for it if they get free education and a free degree what incentives do you have as an american citizen so now you graduate from college 60000 in debt and yet you still cant get the job you want but yet they graduate college with no negative dollar amount in their account and they get the job they want is this making any sense to any of you people this is a logical most of these people and it wont end
did this kid find the time masheen from the idiocracy future
i love these keep them going crowder
my favorite part with leroy was him saying that he has tought about this for 3 years no we cant possibly have the same definition of the word thought its just not possible
mine field far cheaper and more effective armed snipers every 2 miles with shoot on site orders only a few people would be shot before they stopped trying find and blow up their tunnels with airplanes with ground penetrating radars and jdams
arguing with retards should be the name of this segment
steven you should do im antiporn andor proabstinence it would be amazing god bless you 
building a wall doesnt fix problems in mexico
could you please cover the issue where migrant kids are being separated from their parents because i am so confused and have no idea what is really going on
this kid brought a great argument and back up his points with great thinking for a secure border in the us and the control of imigration open the right path and the people wont have to do it illegally but will want to work to be legal and show they want to be here and they just want a better life to live  peacefully and they want to give back to this great country that we live in great argument and crowder was stubborn to not want to accept it haha the kid changed his mind haha even thoe he was embarrassed to say it haha  what a fool  haha
youre trending
build the wall
veto the upcoming despacito 2             change my mind
back at it again with the checkered vans
i dont really care if they build this wall it wont work but mexico wont pay thats for sure
the xray border hahahaha tracking people all over the country is the opposite of freedom thats whats happening in fascist regimes like north korea where you have checkpoints in between citys painful to watch
both of their accents sounded off i dont believe any of this
awesome opinion of two morons
build the xray border change my mind
should i jack off tonight change my mind
this is painful that there arent properly educated arguments against your position its easy to argue with people that havent done the research which is why this works in your favour that doesnt make you right though but it doesnt make you wrongit also begs the question as to whether you pick the debates that you win to make the final cut just frustrating because although im not american and im not fully aware of this issue i can tell by the way your guests talk they are not people that stand any chance of beating someone with knowledge biased or not
oh steven im gonna guess no one tried to change your mind
what surprised me most is i saw adds
an xray gate tracker while you go through the border but borders are going to become the past  firstly xrays dont work like that  second of all i dont want our citizens to be tracked  we are not wildlife with rfid tags  leave us alone  the people who break into the country are a problem  i have no problem with someone who has legally immigrated  i have a lot of great friends that are legal immigrantswhat is this dude talking about  he thinks he knows way more than he really does  keeping track of millions of people is hard  i dont want a fullblown wall but i want people to crack downeven if they do pay taxes it costs legal citizens way more to pay for their healthcare
sheesh im hispanic and both of these people are so clueless lol
hes seemed nice enough    but holy shit hes a moron  lmfao
can you make the next video women dont get paid less than men
that guy was fucking exhausting
the only relevant question does a country have a right to determine who does and doesnt come into its borders anyone who says no is a fucking anarchist
iq  cabbage level
he described a border ahahha
just because you think it is going to happen does not make it so510 years this guy thinks borders will endi will wager him a months salary the exact opposite happensamerica has a culture as well pal and it is not mexico it will get worse until it doesnt that does not might be a very brutal thing
build an x ray wall 1020
dont build a wall thats a waste of money didnt you see mexico score against germany they will find a way a crack and get in instead put a microchip on everyone in the country and if you dont have the chip you cant buy nada and it kills 2 birds with one stone immigration and those religious lemmings
the guy proposed a wall from futurama
x ray border 
this dude is a fucking idiot
why would i want to change your mind if you enjoy being on the wrong side of history go for it  people will be able to watch your videos in a century and laugh this time contrarily to most of your topics where you choose to stand behind an history that has already passed and set its foot in the ground you are talking about something that might in fact really happen the famous mexico wall but it will surely be taken down like the berlin wall in less than 100 years when there will be more residents of south american origins in usa than of any other origin i think what you are is some kind of sophisticated bully  or a gentleman bully your topics are often about your nonacceptance of people that think differently from you while the whole point of postmodernity was to shout who cares you do you and ima do me capice i dont think this current trend of conservatives will last because it is strongly supported by the baby boomers who have recently retired and now found time to go vote increasingly you are not going to recognize the world you live in  you could then opt to live in russia
why dont we all leave america and leave lefties feminist stay alone in america under their rules  trust me  it will be fun watching them getting raped from illegal emigrants  or die for food 
why didnt we build a wall in the canadian border so crowder could not come over here
you chose to interview the most retarded individuals 
is not gay jared wearing a fanny pack
the wall is a dumb idea  if we really wanted to prevent illegal immigration we would simply charge employers with a crime when they did not use everify  folks would leave organically instead america is going for the money grab and is putting illegal immigrants in detainment centers run by private corporations and were putting ankle bracelets on them too  do your homework this was planned years ago
im 110 against the wall but this kids arguments are not helping the cause at all xray points what basically hes suggesting chipping people lol
i could argue against the wall
that dude whos for open boarders is very ignorant
saw a crtv ad on this video lol
dont build the wall because mexico is the only friend that will support you or help you remember katrina what country send the army with a lot of food and supplies and left the country vulnerable to be attacked yes mexico just to help the people that lost everything and they didnt got any thank you from the usa they risk their country protection just to help what usa had to deal by him self
please do pro life
you know star trek lets just do that transporters and biosign scans ill contact the mastermind theq to run the kinks out then ill run for governor
fikn stupid as most with money cross from  canadian soil  the 3 foot high fence really says it all
im from spain my ass haha that dude mexican af
crowder i agree with most of your points opinions in these videos  but building a wall just seems like a waste of money to me and sure it will slow down the process of illegal immigration but it sure as hell wont stop it i definitely am not for illegal immigration i just dont think this is the solution more security yes but not a literal wall ps all those illegal immigrants asking for respect is ridiculous youre here illegally try becoming a citizen and then maybe ill rrspect you
trumpwhen mexico sends its people theyre not sending their best theyre not sending you theyre not sending you theyre sending people that have lots of problems and theyre bringing those problems with us theyre bringing drugs theyre bringing crime theyre rapists and some i assume are good people he was talking about mexico not mexicansthere are many people from central america in mexico that are criminals that mexico does not want
the pure idiocy coming from these peoples mouths are the average people voting in this country
pretty easy to debate unprepared randoms on the street
woke woke derp derp derp woke derp derp woke wokey derpy woke derp derp
spaceforce change my mind
shoot them full of xrays and give them cancer cause thats more humane than a wall
that guy is a moron i feel dumber having listened to him
full retard
can we get a gofundme started to get a new van for steven
i have come to the conclusion a lot of americans are either misinformed or uneducated
it took him 3 years to come up with thatour education system is crying
damnit congress get leroy out to dc to start planning the xray border already
so he wants to microchip human beings or was i misunderstanding him
i love how he says he doesnt want a wall then turns around with 1984 big brother police state shit peoples numbers scanners facial recognition etc the wall would be cheaper than that shit and not scifi
i disagree with the wall itself for multiple reasons 1 it as a whole including guards building maintenance etc  is way too expensive and there could be better ways to use our tax money to stop illegal immigration 2 i care about our wildlife and the wall would seriously disrupt wildlife immigration patterns
this was hard to watch lol good job steven
i dont understand why people are so against having a wall at the border isnt there already a wall there
even trump dont pay his taxes his unpaid taxes can fund all of mexico dont drag immigrants for unpaid taxes even if they dont pay taxes for the next 100 years it still would not match up to the amount of unpaid taxes from the wealthy what i dont understand is the hypocrisy of these leaders and why people choose to support such hypocritical people im not a hillary supporter either i might add if trump wants to build a fking wall he better build it with his own unpaid tax money dont expect citizens of america or mexico to fund that useless project
its simple if the law was followedevery politician running for potus had a firm position on this but trump is actually doing something about it
if hes gonna be the governor of new mexico then im going to be the queen of england
after watching that i now support wakanda 
dude doesnt even know what an xray is talking about building xray border wtf go green lol
there is no need for borders 30 sec later give them passports make them citizensdreamer in a nutshell
we want more of these the unwashed masses demand it
dudes speaking way too fast hes probably high on adderall
im not mexicanyes you are lol
stevencrowder do you support an belive in a literal wall or the idea of it
that dude from new mexico is a hypercaffeinated retard
the fuck we need a wall for when everyone knows they coming in through tunnels 
the fact that we have to explain why illegal immigration is bad is a huge red flagjesus it just physically hurts me to think these people can vote
i feel so sorry for the woman who seemed so afraid to ask for help doing what she felt was the right thing hopefully she is able to find some assistance keep up the good work steven and i cant wait for the next change my mind
that guy made me lose several brain cells
i hope that dude was just really high for his sake as a human i wish i could use the wrong word as much as this guy does
taxation is theft changemy mind
the second guy was trying to solve the problem by assuming that everyone everywhere has an rfid chip implanted in them and when you pass the border your chip is scanned how the hell is tagging people with rfid chips which means that you can pretty much track them everywhere as long as you have scanners better and more humanitarian than a fucking wall do you really want to give any government a taste of such power
why do you keep doing interviews with unintelligent people why not ask an authority on immigration most people that are in us illegally are here via air plane they overstay their visa  so that wall will need to be damn high lol
i dont want a wall i want microchips and xray machines insteadholy shit were fucked
im from santa fe nm and i say get them out 
but the thing is that there is no need to spend millions on a wall when there are already fences around the border why are you talking as if there is no border between america and mexico when there are security is also tough as hell already there is already a border dont waste tax money on that drumph wall
im a cheap prick who cant afford it but im always telling people to watch and subscribe still pissed that subscribing through youtube does nothing notifications work
2 millions subs is a bit concerning
a couple years ago when the first libtard politicians were saying we should be building bridges not walls and other similar emotional arguments i googled do any countries have border walls or are building themwow was i surprised if it was left to our msm and liberal dems  rinos youd believe that only american isolationists favor border security let alone walls turns out that there are over 68 countries with walls of various kinds and another 32 were in the construction or planning stages geezecant we all just get along  nope i have a fence around my property for a reasonmy right to protect and keep what is mine my fence border delineates the enter at your own peril zone helps keep honest people honest and makes it quicker to easily identify those who have no respect for the law or borders lines of demarcation that only are crossed by those who have no respect for the rights of others if you ignore the signs that declare that if you are found here at nightyoull be found here in the morning you do so by informed risknot understanding english is not a valid excuse for ignoring the obvious universally understood symbolism of what fences and walls representno entry without permission  its really not that difficult if you aint invitedstay the fuck out or there are very grave consequences to face
both of them seem to believe that the wall is supposed to go across the main roads and stop all travel between countries
dolphins are just gay sharks change my mind
i believe the wall is more of a statement than a practical means of stemming the flow of illegals
mr trejo what you have just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard at no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone on youtube is now dumber for having listened to it
he basically was saying he wants a border but doesnt wtf i think people think the term border now a days means that everyone is going to get deported and we hate mexico and blah blah blah no all we want is a secure border to know whos coming in and out why is that so difficult every country has a border and has a right to know who is here
a wall would be a deterrent but not a barrier for people who want to enter the countryplain and simple in the world we live today walls dont mean much anymore there are many ways to bypass them above ground underground by air by sea etcthe manpower behind a wall of such length would be gigantic so you also have to take into account that as well
he wants to put up death wall all over the place microwaves kill dna
naah make another video on the same topic didnt learn much from this one
lmao clueless af
does i did come stupid
the great wall of china is racist
wow
i love the intro hahaha
the guy filming himself is coming up with ideas that other people have to figure out like if you have an idea create the solving yourself
build the wall and deport them now  they dont put into the system as much as they take out
make them become citizens  holy moly they dont do it now why would they then
pants
poor guy they had on didnt know what he was talking about
dont build a normal wall build a super high tech wall that scans the dna of trespassers and tracks their movements i like the way he thinks
that first woman was as smart as a toothpick i guess the plant in the 2 liter bottle gave it away
two bozos off the street building a wall is idiotic plain and simple is that really the most effective way to deal with this issue its a suggestion youd expect from a child
steven crowder is a douchebag change my mind
what does a hugely expensive wall do that a large fence doesnt put that money into schools  teachers
wow i think this was the start of that guys campaign lol
building the wall is nothing more than a waste of money
the wall will hurt us more than help us
why did you even interview that first guy his position was very scientifical
im not opposed to the wall because of what people think its for im against it because of the ridiculous cost for something that will be ineffective
we shouldnt build the wall because its not fiscally conservative instead we should end the welfare state and the drug war this will help eliminate the incentive for welfare leaches and criminals to illegally immigrate to america
lol so i wont be voting for him if he runs for governor of nm
rfid for everyone sounds like fun
that guy was a moron
she sounded hammered
im not even for the wall but i had to stop watching because of cringe
what is a wall gonna do most people who enter the country just outstay their visa they enter legally they just stay illegally
a physical wall is pointless but a invisible xray wall that will only work if they use rfid tags will totally work
im pretty sure that guys final solution would be to implant all humans with gps tracking devices  and hell want to torch the constitution while hes at it
yo crowder i like your vidsbut what is the point of blurring her face if i can see her picture on the badge she is wearing just saying
i know i should be sad that people are this stupid nowadays but im too busy laughing lol
a wall is an extremely poor use of resources and time a bit like all the wars the us has been fabricating since forever the us government and agencies have been trafficking drugs from mexico for decades i wouldnt be surprised if mexican authorities are controlled by us based agencies why not have some sort of mutual contract between countries allowing for an increased window of economical opportunity because the system is rigged boys and girls creating division is important to a minority controlling a majority if you dont understand the art of war let alone the power of unity then i suggest researching into some more conspiratorial matters
how are you suposed to put up an xray gate without a wall to put up the gate
xray borderzzz
walls work two ways crowder keeping people out and keeping people in there will be a time when people will want to leave this place after our currency has been debased completely  and when ped0fila has been normalized good luck getting out if the wall is up
i love how the solution too a wall was make them take tests and become citizens like legal people immigrating have done for 70 years lol the wall isnt for those people lol
why people think they can just enter a country and do whatever the f they want is way beyond me
wow that was a wild ride from start to finish rofl
1054 made me spit out my coffee laughing the look on his face when he realized he was advocating for a border wall 
x ray borders
1054 made me spit out my coffee laughing the look on his face when he realized he was advocating for a border wall 
im mexican american family has been in cali texas and arizona for generations i think only   criminal immigrants regardless of being mexicans or any other race of immigrants should be sent back more importantly the european criminal immigrants these politicians should set an example and deport criminals immigrants closer to their original culture and homeland
click on the video get an ad about this video d
steven this is so unfair you couldve just asked themwell do you lock your doors at night
as a left leaning person on many issues i am not entirely against the idea of some sort of border reinforcement but the logistics of it such as cost to build extreme use of eminent domain fact that it wouldnt prevent underground tunnels fact that it would be very difficult to make it span sections of water effectively on the border and maintenance cost associated with it all lead me to be opposed to the idea being implemented also there is literally no chance in hell mexico would pay for it
this mythical wall lol
ha i have that shirt  018
scientifical haha
i like the shorter more edited style of this one
we do do what this kid says with legal immigrants but we gotta curb it or would we be over populated hence we must stop illegal immigration
the wall is a waste of money citing the current year is a nonargument however in our modernday society we have things like airplanes and boats dont forget ladders and ropes the wall is not only expensive but highly symbolicthe solution to this problem lies in the cause of the problem the people who are coming here do so for a few reasonsone of those reasons may revolve around government corruption dealing with the governments who create these environments would be a good start its akin to telling your neighbor to mow their lawn get your government together so that people arent fleeing in terror and risking their lives to get hereanother reason is financial incentive one important question to answer is who is giving them financial incentivefarmers businessmen and the wealthy like trump who do not want to pay an american living wage it seems that theyre reaping the benefits of this labor and then throwing those illegal immigrant workers under the bus when theyre done with themtaking those who provide incentive and holding their feet to the fire and even fining them would be a great start unfortunately this will never happen for the wealthy tend to not punish the wealthy if they did then america would have locked up a lot of bankers a decade agoif america ends up getting a wall then you can bet that the wealthy will be installing doors for added conveniencewould you pick lettuce for what they earn im sure they couldnt even afford to buy lettuce for what they are paid its backbreaking work and i dont know anyone who would do it for what they are payingmaybe theyll turn to child labor and pay them cash who knowsin summary corrupt governments need to be addressed and the wealthy need to be informed that it is no longer acceptable to hire illegals and to give them incentives to come herecorrupt governments dont address other corrupt governments and the wealthy do not punish others who are wealthy so what well end up getting is a very expensive symbolic gesture that is a wall
the second guy was an imbecile but he accidentally made a good point  in places where drugs are legal the average local isnt smoking pot or doing lines of coke regularly  waste of time policing anything but very destructive drugs
i stayed in canada to long they arrested me go figure
1317 fucking lol you trying to to a jim halpert there
he has to be trolling us
xray border 
if we dont need a wall at our northern boarder we dont need one at our southern boarder
why is this one so short 
not gay jared with crossed arms and aviators might be the best security money can buy
xray border  yeah ok vote for pedro next person please
kick your ass change my mind  lol
building a wall with your ass sounds difficult
1043 well now this is just cringy
no way that was all of it
the last guy has a few brain cells working
mr crowder i have just recently found your videos and blogs by chance but since i have i want you to know that you are truly amazing and since i have not missed a video or episode america needs more people like you fighting for what true freedom is you stand up for what is right and do it better than anyone else thank you for what you do truly is awesome having someone who says what needs to be said
congrats on 2 million subscribers
 what the this guy is off
the argument on this episode is that you found the dingiest dong of the ding dongs rfid i think is that the future govenor is talking about geeeez where do i find this guy on the world wide web
im against the wall only because most immigrants come in right through the boarders already established through fake identities or bribery what we really need is stricter laws against immigrants caught exiting the country illegally and better security guarding the border
how much you want to bet the one guy was an illegal
i wanna know what hes smoking  he must have some good shit what  home boy wants sounds way worse than a wall
ok the guy in the video is completely lost he suggests a wall but its an xray wall which would probably significantly more expensive lol also you cant just tax those people coming in and say the economy is better because many people are poor coming in and theyll hit the system for expenses more than theyll pay in thats terrible economic policy and it shows why so many people are out of touch who oppose the idea for reformed immigration it needs to happen fast before things deteriorate further in the us
plain and simple everyone protects themselvesin houses with walls and doors and locksits not racist to protect and love your countryevery other country does get realillegal is illegala lot of people break laws that they think arent fairrightthey are called criminals always werearabs4trumpeveramericansdestroyingtheirowncountry
ok but you dont actually support building the wall right
with no borders the us becomes latin america
just realized crowder passed 2m subscribers congrats
let them in and tax themwtf you think we have the top 1 crossing over these fuckers are broker than shattered glass putting that aside this guy isnt a serious contender in a debate like this if anything please put up someone more experiencedlogical
these idiotswhy do we have to put up with these idiots we got one dude who says do away with borders and have the mark that i refuse to take because he thinks we need it  this is going to end up really bad
this butt hurt nerd wishes he was milo lol  see what i did
the way you frame your debates makes me think that all is staged in my opinion us has the right to build any wall they want but is stupid to ask for other countries to pay for it massive immigration phenomenon is very complicated and is extremely naive to think that a wall is going to fix it or change it the idea of the wall fools people to vote for trump and many are buying it
the outside yellingcomments really brings bad light the the mexicanssmh you should know better
what changed my mind is how dumb people are the second guy   do not make anybsence when they talk and are soooo miss informedmy grandparents came here legally from italy i have no problem with people coming into the country but do it legally the end and do away with sanctuary citiesneed to be stricter
space cop test pilot for sure
well im not entirely opposed to some kind of xray wall perhaps one that might incinerate anyone who crosses illegally 
trash
im spanish erm no hun youre not
dont stop with the wall lay down a minefield one blast and that will get the wouldbe illegals attention real quick
would love you to come back in quebec for one of these could be nice 
even though crowder brings up legitimate points its hard to view this as fair debates due to the lack of people that contain knowledge on the topic this just feels cheap
what a great idea lets all get chipped so the government can tract us where ever we go what liberty
that future governor of new mexico was absolutely ridiculousbasically the summary of what he saying is i dont know what any of the criteria is for anything but lets make illegal immigrants legal and tax them because reasons  we will also use tech from star trek that will be available in five to ten years  his level of education is terrifying
you cant tag peoples bodys and setup scanners to track there movements an stuff that could be used to horrible corruptible effect by a corrupt government an risk enslavement of people anything you force on people really goes against freedom as a whole
dogs are better than carschange my mind
like ya know um  signs of idiocy
a world with open borders would be insanity and chaos each country would slowly fall 1 by 1 and the citizens will flee to the nearest safe space these safe spaces will become limited and there will be one nation  probably texas which should be its own nation or australia  that will have a border and people living in peace this retarded spanish dude is living in a fantasy world he seems to just want drugs he clearly loves taking drugs
no border control and instead install an xray machine and illegal immigrants walk through it hello dumbass fucking low iq he is trying to sound smart but when he talks he has no clue no sir you wont even make as a local council lol let along a governor of new mexico lol that kids is what we call school brainwashing when your teachers tells you you can be whatever you want to be this guy really believes that
she says loan shark money lending not money laundering
okay lets weigh in on thiscrowder illegal immigrants are not intimidating the legal ones  the broken system that is being used to deport illegal ones is negatively effecting the legal ones with families and friends  you gloss over this like its a nonissue unfortunately due to things like i dont know morals it isyou know whats even worse  saying that the wall is an encouragement for citizenship  never before has this worked and it wont work this time the only way this is going to go is a violent path where people end up getting shot or arrested at the border  do you want to know why  because illegal immigrants werent able to get citizenship in the first place thats why theyre illegal  a wall is going to solve their problems and theyre going to get magical citizenship from thin air i suppose i mean fine get rid of them but more will still come and try resulting in violenceand where are the funds for this wall coming from exactly  i guess healthcare for all is a stupid evil socialist concept but a wall that will cost billions to build and billions more to maintain and patrol is a good use of money  sounds greattalking of money what is the economical impact going to be on the country when you get rid of all those illegal immigrants taking the jobs you dont want  you do realise that illegal immigrants if anything are taken advantage of by businesses  theyre literally referred to as the building blocks of your economy man  httpsdigitalcommonschapmaneducgiviewcontentcgiarticle1001contexthonorsstudentworkmaybe im getting too worked up here but my god  really  really  you want to build a wall  to what end  this isnt the middle fucking ages  i suppose youre going to start throwing hot oil over the top next yeah  thatll stop them   maybe then theyll be able to get the citizenship which youre making nearly impossible to get  this encouragement for citizenship line is simply a cover for the dark truth if they leave they wont have the chance to legally become a citizen and part of me thinks that you would be just fine with thatps  change my mind  you never intended to change your mind you just want to win the debate  against unprepared people
the guy with the white shirt had the spirit of antichrist in him he essentially was on the verge of proposing constant global citizen location monitoring by means of an electronic tag mark of the beast
vote for leroy for governor of new mexico lmao
dude building the wall is retarded and too costly just annex mexico lol
the leftists ruined incredibles 2
i live in canada and couldnt believe on how many illegals there and coming in plus the messed up situation of people hiring illegals which effects allot of things and how much money it costs to deal with it all so maybe a wall is good in the long run
im not trying to argue but how much would a wall cost us and how much would it cost the usa why dont we use the wall money to overthrow central americas regimes and place a leader that will benefit his  country and our country lets have a peaceful adult conversation
they was seriously nobody with a better argumentation than that 
the last one was a dreamer poor guy
i have respect for the 2nd guy but hes has no idea what to say
the governor of new mexico httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvooz1xpbnhg
yes lets have an xray machine that scans 2000 miles of border scanning what exactly their tiny mexican dcks
90 certain the guy was high next stop buy munchies
wow that second guy
open borders with a check point  this dude was trying so hard though
this dude is an idiotah
that was fucking painful gonna go shoot myself now
im a mexicanamerican ive lived in both countries and i can simply tell that building a wall is just throwing money away most illegals cross to the usa legally because they have visas and they legally get their permits they just never go back to their country the drugs coming to the usa are either coming through the border or below it i used to cross every day to go to work when i was living in mexico waiting in line 1 to 3 hours for 4 years and i think i saw like 3 or 4 people jumping the border well trying  fortunately the bps were able to catch themit would be awesome if a simple wall could stop the overflow of illegals but most come legally and drugs usually come from narco tunnels
i think you should to a change my mind that is a complete lie just make up statistics and see what you get
if he truly think support the wall i will be unsubbing from this channel
that spanish guy is definitely mentally deficient
that guy from nm is a clueless dumbass hed make a great governor of nm 
the enemy is so dumb
maybe let some like smart people like you know trump im a stable genius
fucking moron lol
a wall wouldnt stop the majority of illegal immigrants that enter the us most of them come via air plane and over stay their visa httpwwwpolitifactcompunditfactstatements2015sep08jorgeramosramos40undocumentedimmigrantscomeaira wall could stop some but it would waste tax payer money
that dude is hella mexican lmao im not mexican im from spain 
lol he wants to be a governor i think he needs a few more iq points
that dumb fuck about to have an anxiety attack
this video was weak these couldnt be the best arguments against the wall
once again there is a lot of poorly informed individuals and some of those with really badly thought out ideas on this subject
wow worse episode ive ever watched neither one was articulate enough to express a fully coherent thought
proper scientifical xray
just lol at this
us citizens dont care to support businesses that hire only us citizens so there will always be a demand for illegal immigrants as they provide cheap labor  much like the situation with the drug war there is so much demand for drugs that attempting to rid the country of them will not work  there are far too many us citizens who either want illegal immigrants here or dont really care for the wall to work  ultimately it will just make the illegal immigrants that make it here slightly less cheap increasing the cost of their services across the country but probably not enough to stop hiring them
lol when youre facing a retard you let him rant on for minutes on end without a single interruption but when you face someone like youssef who schools you you interrupt him every 2 seconds and then go on to say that he speaks in paragraphs
love the shorts
narcissist
hahaharespect steven a pro at navigating incoherent rambling
please do a change my mind episode about police brutality i assume youre propolice like a sane human above the iq of 8
the wall is a waste of fucking money better laws are all that is needed
im losing brain cells at a super fast scientifical rate
this kid listens to the joe rogan podcast a little too much
crazy
that xray border guy is on some type of drug
the first guy is so stupid it pissed me off
i feel so bad for this women  she seems terrified its horrifying that shes afraid to speak out against  criminals nobody should have to fear their neighbors with no recourse to keep their children and families safe
why do people say  we cant deport them all bs it would be a lot cheaper they get welfare money healthcare and housing plus they cheat on income taxes and get thousands per person
so she whispers a secret in your ear and you subtitle it lol 
wow  the guy is totally against borders and thinks we should all move about freely but he would rfid chip everyone and the government could track them anytime anywhere
x ray gates sweet jesus what a moron
33 of homicides  wtf are you talking about dude your numbers are stupid wrong im for border control but come on dude those numbers are not factshttpswwwwashingtonpostcomnewswonkwp20180619twochartsdemolishthenotionthatimmigrantshereillegallycommitmorecrime
undocumented immigrants dont commit 37 of all murder thats ridiculous
hillary proposed a wall too funny to me  but dems blame trump
i dont know man if you know the lady you can totally make up who she is and im sure word about your booth made around the block these folk aint stupid a google search and boom well its probably too late now anyway but you gotta think more carefully about that steven
omg the second person you spoke to sounds like hes stoned yeah make a boarder xray machine
i took this girl out on a saturday night she seemed like she might be alrightbut there was just something off when she  opened her mouth it took me a minute to figure it outshe said shes getting  a degree in transgendered studiesand she wishes that she could do it for freewe pulled the car up to the mcdonalds drive thru and she said minimal wage should be raised tooshe said that health care should be freethen she grabbed her ebtthey said we dont accept food stamps and thats when it quickly hit meshes a liberal liiiiiberal oh no when she speaks i tell her please dont speak no moreshes a liberal liberal oh nowhen she speaks i tell her please dont speak no more
this is honestly frustrating man just listening to these people u should do a talk this video was so open ended we didnt even get to hear your point of view i dont like the idea of a wall because it means keep everyone out no matter what they did it their situation a wall would be good if citizenship was made easy to all those who needed to come in and to those who commit crimes serious things like killing or stealing and dont wanna pay taxes deport those not people who are illegal and get parking tickets
yes x ray people and keep a data base of where your going and why keeping digital papers with you at all times  making sure its all masterminds and scientifical yup way better than a wall its terrifying that anyone thinks wall is a bad idea and that trump is tyranical but surveillance databases digital tracking digital papers and xraying is less tyranical
so much head butting with the guy
im most surprised with this change my mind is that youtube didnt demonetize it ahah
the ending
nice to see stevens doing some comedy again really funny sketch
ill say this at least the liberal college students can put a coherent sentence together
what a complete moron
dont mind listening to ignorant people but draw the line at crazy homeboys recently had his head on a baseball bat and spun around it
the guy you interviewed gave me a headachehes a fucking dumbass
more drugzeh and mastermindzeh
idk if a full length wall is necessary but we definitely need to fix the illegal immigrants problem
do you pick the people yourself in order to make you look smarter
build a nuclearpowered electric fence instead much cheaper
vote for leroy essa
oh my gosh your face at the end said it all i wish this video could have had a little more substance instead of whatever cringeinducing things that guy was talking about but great go as always steven stay strong 
new mexico better watch out you got a mastermind planner bringing scientifical ideas to the table as governer
xray detector all over the border lol
first conversation so unproductive no point in including
oh hes not mexican he is new mexican from new mexico completely different he just so happens to have brown skin and be equally educated as a rock loving it great bit
america is a continent not a country change my mind
scientifical
holy shit this guy is a complete fuckin moron
i would love to see the other video
my god the cringe lvl is over 9000instead of xrays we should use drones lol im sure i am not the first person to think of tht but i think it would be more cost effective an would also produce jobsdont want to turn all those immigrants into mini hulks lolthe most surprising part was tht guy thinking he is gonna be governor lol
digital passcode xray gate we in 2018 and hes 2573
im mexican born raised and living in mxico i think the us should build a wall and pressure our government into fixing problems instead of pushing them into our neighbors and encourage legal migration
build the wall  deport them all
why stop at the border lets just xray the entire globe have no borders and one big government tracking everyone now we just need some masterminds and engineers to think about it and boom no more crime ever perfect utopia
i dont think its a good idea because of how much money we would spend on it its proven that its below one percent of illegal immigrants come accross in this way 90 get a green card and just over stay thus we should spend that 3 billion tracking green card jobs that are about to expire and checking jobs also a tracking chip in the card to find them this will find 90 of them not stop less then one percent with a really expensive wall
built it  these people are retarded  mofo you aint spanish
xrays
make the wall out of ice and just get jon snow to patrol it job done
you can tax them if they dont show up for their court date buddy
try having our current border as your backyard youll want that wall when strangers come around especially if you got kids  dont expect people to respect you when they had to break in to begin with  i dont want you to have a fence up or walls on your house is essentially what some of these people are saying
he sounded like every other liberal he thinks he knows what hes talking about because he can kinda use big words yea have them write you a paper about where they want to go and why guy standing in the desert with a clipboard looking for the illegals going senior wait senior you need to write your paper to tell us where you want to go senior wait come back you need to write your paper senior 
it took him 3 years to formulate that thought
this nigga leroy retarded lmfao hes on sum shit
please cite where you obtained the statistics that illegal immigrants commit 37 of homicides
for everyone who wants to know the statistics this video lays it all out httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv2u4vlgr2ihs
i really hope that woman is ok you didnt do a very good job of concealing her identityhope you at least helped her enough so she could report these people and get herself out of danger
dont build a wall instead of that and bringing the mexicans to america why dont we bring america to them yeah lets take over their government kick out the cartels and send them to south america just annex the land divide it into a bunch more states and liberate the people and that way they wont have to leave their homes and they will all become american citizens instantly and then give them ss id s 1 by 1  i know it would take a lot of work and money but it could be done hell ill bet you could even get a yea vote from most mexicansrussia did it with crimea why cant we do it with mexico and if not maybe even the threat of it will make the mexican government think twice about funnelling people to our borders just a thought
if you didnt get many sit down discussions does this mean that those who oppose building the wall do not have an intelligent basis for their side  flipping the bird or cursing to me lacks courtesy intelligence and respect  no one is saying that immigrants legally or illegally are saying lazy but illegal immingrants are criminals by the very nature of breaking the us law by crossing the border illegally  i know that large corporations support the illegal immigrants due to the fact of wanting low wage workers  heres a thoughtmaybe pay low income americans a living wage and forgo immigrant employment  help your own people out  you can deport the illegal immigrants if you really wanted to  it is your country  thats like saying that the immigration problem in europe is so out of control that there is no hope for controlling it but again thats not true  thats wimping outtake control  im from canada and we have our own immigration problem occuring since trudeau and i feel it is our resposibility to speak out and act towards stomping on this problem
is he incredibly stupid or mentally ill
walls plural  lets be clear
his face at the end hah
stevencrowder i have a hard time agreeing with you here a wall might help prevent some illegal immigration but the percentage of illegal immigrants who get in by just overstaying their visa makes the cost to build the wall not worth it to most people like everything there are pluses and minuses on either side for example agricultural work utilizes massive amounts of illegal immigrants as an opposing example illegal immigrants tend to bring in more drugs and crime as you stated but possibly the reason for that is they cannot gain legal citizenship easily and would rather resort to illegal activity to make a buck so by making citizenship easier to obtain we could keep the types of illegal immigrants that would be good for this country and crack down on those who still refuse to acquire citizenship even when its possible for them to do so tldr find a middle ground create faster nonexclusive routes to us citizenship and then deal with the remainder
10 minutes with a methhead thanks steve
dudes from spain 1500s spain ok letting it sink inno still dont get itpass
this 2nd guy is gold
should have done more to conceal her the first woman identity black instead of blur and voice changing
when they talk about gun control you used the argument that bad people or criminals dont care about the law how is this any different building a wall wont make any difference for them right however there should definitely be better immigration laws
fuck your wall
youre debating people who arent that bright
nice change my mind ad before your video steven im hoping more people come to your channel to hear the truth 3
please do a part 2
in regard to that first lady as somebody who married into a hispanic family i can tell you most hispanics are very conservative conservative in their views on immigration abortion fiscal matters social reform and so on  but what may surprise you and im hoping someone from louder with crowder reads this because it something that most people in our communityconservatives trying to provide an alternative media source are unaware of the fake news is not only present in the englishspeaking media but it is 100 times worse on networks such as univision and telemundoi dont mean anything ugly by this but my experience tells me that this woman speaks very little english and completely understands even less i would bet dollars to donuts that most of her news and the media she consumes comes from networks like telemundo and univisionunlike cnn and msnbc telemundo and univision do not just bend a convenient version of the truth and their reporting they out right lie my wife tells me shes the one that speaks spanish that on regular basis reporters like jorge ramos tell the viewers that if the wall succeeds they will be unable to visit their family ever again they tell them on a regular basis that president trump and the republicans want to deport hispanics who are already us citizens they tell them that if the wall goes up we will no longer allow anybody from mexico to come here for any reason they told them before the election those that are in the process of becoming residents and or citizens that is president trump is elected no matter what part of the process they were in that they would be deported was no groundsno this lady may genuinely be against building the wall but judging by how confused she was and just the way she was talking im willing to bet she was a victim of some of this fake newsits my sincere hope that somebody whether it be louder crowder or someone like them will begin to expose how bad this really is my wife and i have considered doing it ourselves and upon further research can find nobody of like mind who havent drank the democratic koolaidits incredible to me how many hispanic people vote democrat when in my experience none of them seem to hold any democratic valuesplease excuse my spelling and grammar im on a mobile device and i used voice text to put this together
very obvious when someone comes on who bases their information off of social media and when they read and dig for it themselves
sigh how the fuck do these people get through life
i would like to change your mind on this even thou i agree ilegal immigration is wrong so here it goes its far too expensive and people will find a way to go across it anyways instead people shouldnt hire those ilegal immigrants for jobs they dont want to do or dont want to pay fairly for that would be the solution i could think off since us has no immigrant support program unlike my country mexico
its not an easy thing to solve but building a wall isnt a good solution they can still come over in planes and overstay their visa theres not really a good way to do it but if we could track them down and give them a choice to become a citizen or deport them then thats the best way i can think and set up a way for them to register as a citizen and immigrate legally if not then zero tolerance deportation is the other choice they get
feminism is a myth change my mind
this guy is going to be our next president
we should just invade and conquer mexico
i really had to skip the rest of this video after the woman talked due to the hard cringe of spanish mexican etc guy
the wall is a waste of time money and resources  it wont stop a thing and people who think its a good idea are idiots
that second guy though
330 conversation so i get the blurred face but how bout the fucking name badge with a huge pic of her and place of work and name
taxes
notice how crowders never actually had his mind changed
my familys been in the new mexico sense 1550s this guy had me dying
congrats heres to another 2000000 subscribers and many more
crazy no wall or security but please tag us like deer wow
youre a pathetic excuse for a thinking human stevenim not just talking about this videoim talking about you at your core essence its rotten
next do the earth isnt flat change my mind
i mean im all for legal immigration and not wanting people here illegally but im not sure a nation with copious amounts of debt building a multibillion dollar wall with multimillion dollar yearly upkeep is the smartest strategy to achieve border security thats not even taking into account the fact that people can just fly over the damn wall anyway the wall is a garbage idea for reasons that have nothing to do with immigration once again steven sets these up under the pretense of having a conversation but frames the discussion in such a way that is in no way conducive to actually progressing a dialogue its no surprise that most people willing to jump into a random conversation with a stranger regarding hot button issues arent the most well spoken bunch of course the guy with a political commentary platform is going to be significantly more prepared to debate than some rando on the street people who know better arent going to waste their time on this unless they have a vested interest in the topic
if i had a fence round my garden but foxes kept getting through it and eating my chickens and i had a gate that people and other nice animals to could through then i would build a fucking wall that would stop foxes getting in its as simple as that
billions and billions of opeiets
this guy watches too much csi
the spanish male in  the end was a complete idiot he sounds wild crazy
we need to sterilize ppl who come here illegally and that guy has zero hope for gov lol
damn the crazy delusional cretin at 1140 really showed how the can do attitude americans instil in their youth can at times be a very dangerous scary even dubious thing im still shaking in fear because of that guy 
the second guy needs to learn the negative effects of illegal immigrants they cost a ridiculous amount of money to the government and therefore to people who legally enter the country its not only crime
that useful idiot is asking for a nwo chip
you cant change mind of idiots
your face at the end says it all  and i dont envy you having to sit through that
but why are you discussing with people who are stupid i mean you cant start discussing things like this with people with low iqs and no arguments whatsoever
lol the 2nd guy is actually retarded he basically said to make people that purposely came here without getting citizenship to  get citizenship
i am surprised that the young man was advocating for more power of big brother
the guy in the white tee really needs to give his thoughts  a lot more thought i think he just likes to hear himself talk he has nothing useful to offer
respect to that first lady she seemed a little confused with some things but thats okay she had the right idea and she was brave enough to step up and talk about it
we dont need feminism  change my mind
stevencrowder no way in hell guy number 2 should suggest a electronic id chip passport never letting the government put an identification chip in my body no fuckin way
omfggov of new mexicohis passion is certainly theremissing somethings thoughlikenon convoluted thoughts funny how stevens expression was the exact same as mine at the end lol
what percentage of murders are committed by white mass shooters tho 
lmao
new mexico wasnt a state until 1912 his family might have been in that area since 1550 but definitely not in new mexico
holy smokes people like this make me feel like a modern day einstein
what the gentleman from spanish descent said regarding borders becoming a thing of the past falls incredibly in line with the plan for a one world government they are pushing to control general thought and consensus to desire being borderless so we are on board with it and that i feel is a huge part of why the younger generation is against maintaining our borders im not even for the wall i believe we could establish better security without having to build it but regardless theyre being mentally manipulated into the thought of being without borders and primed for communism by media television celebrities and the pressure to fit in
i actually have no doubt in my mind that mr leeroy will actually one day  become the governor of new mexico and then you will all see that he wasnt so crazy
i refuse to believe that this person is representative of the antiwall position
wouldnt all illegal immigrants be committing crimes since it is a felony to come here illegally
2k mile long xray machine
im a conservative so dont even try to accuse me of being some snowflake liberal because i think the wall is a stupid idea1 mexico will never pay for it  they have no reason to and it only costs them2 the us will have to pay for the wall which is a huge waste of money3 in a few hundred years your childrens children and so on will still have to pay to maintain the wall4 the wall would require constant maintenance servicing and protection creating additional costs to the taxpayer5 illegal immigrants do all of the jobs that americas youth are too precious and delicate for  without them society would collapse
we all living in 2018 while leroy living in 3018 
i dont really have an issue as to the why of build the wall  nor the price of building it my big question is how practical would it be the drug cartels wouldnt just dig a tunnel if someone could enlight me about this i would be really greatfull great video crowder
lol he wants to be the governor of new mexicothats cute
one way to stop illegal immigration and make mexico pay for the wall 2550 tax rate on money wired to mexico in any form usd or pesos
the wall is the stupidest shit u know how much damage to wildlife it will cause
i just found out about you and this is amazing         if there was any topic i would like to see in this change my mind segment is change my mind boyscouts  should not allow girls to joineven though they have changed their name to scouts of america i want to know why people believe girls should join when the girl scouts organization is a strong organization and the ceo of girl scouts  is somewhat against it alsoplease try to do this topic as i would like to know peoples stances on this topic
jesus h i want this first guy to tutor my kids
what he described was everything that has to do with boarder control
braver than the us marines
could be wrong but dont most illegal immigrants come in with a temporary visa and stay longer than they are supposed to so a wall wouldnt change that but correct me if im wrong
more reason to build the wall
653 anybody have a source for that statistic
lol that second guy from new mexico is amazing
the wall is insanely expensive and fairly pointless  1 drugs arent commonly hauled through openings in the current boarder or walls they transported in other ways  usually via rivers roads and even delivery services sadly enough 2 as for illegal immigration problem mass majority of that comes from air travel i and i dont think going to build a wall to stop air travel  most illegal immigration occurs from good intentions  such as over staying ones visa or traveling legally into the nation for a day trip or shopping trip to not return 3 a lot of the frown upon stuff occurs beyond those peoples control by that i meaning cartels forcing seemingly innocent people into illegal actions  and sometimes people spend life savings on fleeing their nation and country because of real danger  i dont disagree we have a serious problem but i feel like a wall isnt a solution maybe a metaphorical wall but a real physical wall is nothing more than a cod piece for trump to show off about  it wont really stop anything on its own
its just painful to see how stupid people are no wonder its rare to have good honest discussion between two opposing sides
build it
just blows my mind how people are so stupid  they are the same people wishing for world peace but no clue how to get there  everyone loves everyone everyone wants to do the right thing
build the wall already fuck those beans
these people are basically saying that we could fix the problems with illegal immigration by treating them how we do legal immigration
wow more of a youre retarded prove me wrong segment then anything else
some kind of electronic id tag xray scanner this guy is living in 2030  what show does the second guy do he seems like someone that would be fun to watch haha
401 the sort of people who would likely harm her for talking to you could easily work out who she is by the plant shes carrying her handbag and her voice and the moments you did not blur the side of her face you did kind of try not to but you may have inadvertently put this person at risk
we need to make leroy of go green global an internet sensation
cheap prick here keep up the good work maybe youll change my mind
proof that stupid people are easily brainwashed
xray borders ftw
im not mexican im spanish my family is there since 1550s wtf
mentally challenged special edition
that guys idea would only work if all other countries had the same system in place but it could work if the us reformed immigration so that all someone had to do was go to a us embassy or consulate in their home country and fill a form that asked them to explain in detail why they want to enter the us as well as fill out a form that allows the us to perform a background check on them
isnt american made upon illegal immigration
thats the most mexican looking spaniard ive ever seen ridiculous familys been here centuries even before the first settlement in nm still cant speak proper english
second guy is explaining the nwo globalist system he even mentioned some way to track every individual the mark of the beast will have everyone tracked and taxed and no one will be able to buy or sell without it you can call this dude a dreamer or a dummy but if you believe in the bible what he speaks of is going to be reality
this is a great topic for a change my mind i actually feel like if you ever do get a good turn out you should probably have armed security or something i see alot of potential with this lol man this one is ballsy lol
cmon man that dude had to be doing performance art nobody is that dumb right
his face expression after leroy left looked like he was getting ready to hulk the flip out  
we already have fences down there arent we just reinforcing the physical barrier that we already have by building a wall  i see no problem with that or is that just proof that a physical barrier doesnt work heres a thought you know what doesnt stop a bullet as well as a kevlar vest styrofoam build the wall
the pogo intros are amazing
for all we these stats are made up it would be nice if you can put some sources
xray scanner
scientifical wow  just wow
you didnt blur her fucking id card pull this video
silly people have no clue about this topic  people check your emotions at the door  do some research on the facts and numbers before you open your mouth and look uneducated use this proven method for everything you do in life cause it works
if you have a leaky pipe and your house is starting to flood would your solution be to grab a bucket and start scooping out the water or first patch up the pipe
ha ha ha you can be anything you want to be sonim gonna be the governor of new mexico when i grow up
blocking her face really doesnt do much to conceal her identity  hopefully the people in her complex dont see this video
you should not have included the blurred out woman at all it is likely somebody recorded the interview on a phone and her face might get out there
if youre for building the wall you know shit for economics if the wall was free for us then yeah build that shit fuck build one on the canada border as well but 20 billion dollar on a wall is ridiculous how about we end the drug war fix our shit immigration policies increase the budget for our immigration legal system make it easier for immigrants to get work visas taxationistheft lol
omg that second guy  lets build a huge governmental surveillance system that montiors the digital id emplanted in your body to track your movement everywhere because who needs borders and walls are stupid
what an insanely totalitarian view of that guy follow people to know where they are seriously
i one day plan on being the governor of new mexicoi spat my coffee all over my screen
pretty shit job with the face cover blur
i feel extremely smart compared to these people interviewed
an xray borderoh man
man this guy needs to fucking wake up
i think the problem with the wall is how long it will take to build and the price of it also i think to secure the border we should do what we do with canada
they dont want to build a wall to keep people from getting in my brother they want to build a wall to keep your ass from getting out
you throw around facts a lot but dont seem to put any of your sources in the description with a quick google search i found that undocumented immigrants commit far less crimes please do not spread false information there is already enough
this segment will never work most leftists are completely retarded and cant even articulate their own opinions let alone understand a conservatives opinions enough to debate against it
that look he gives like this person is dumb as a brick
lmao i was gonna say this guy is from new mexico  he has the accent  ummmm huuuuuh yahhh soooo
tbh i see what that hispanic guy was saying right however there is no way to know if we would actually document all the immigrants who walk into america by his method not to mention all the thieves murderers and drug dealers that come into america by illegal means would find it easier to cross by his proposition overall it just wouldnt work plus america is not some grocery store anyone can just walk into its a damn nation for goodness sake huh people dont understand that a our country is our house we put gates around our houses so not everyone can just waltz into our homes fret not brothers and sisters when trump is elected in 2020 im sure well see bigger strides to see the wall built
at least this dude sat down he needs some hitch in his giddyup
how many negatives is there for the wall money time people get through tunnels nowadays im trying to say that maybe we dont necessarily need a wall specifically
i like you stevencrowder i do but this is fucking retarded  a wall will do little to nothing  do you realize that over 70 of illegal  immigrants are visa overstays according to cms   they come into the country legally via airplane mostly on vacation visas and just stay  your all for small goverment when it comes to healthcare collages and so forth but when it comes to dumbass walls  and wasteful wars  you love spending taxes on that shit  make up your mind sir big goverment or small witch do you want 
how do you check that without a border wall i dont know omfg
that first guy is an idiot he literally has no knowledge of anything he and crowder brought up not sure whos watching what hes streaming
steven shouldve just hit them with the billy madison lmfao god damn that is my generation fuck meeeeat no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul
this mexican guy is a moron
we dont need a wall  a wall only guarantees complacency  ancient sparta fell after it built a wall  no one gets into area 51 without an invite so the same boots and sensors are needed on the southern border  and a sign a sign that reads is there life after death trespass here and find out
thats my cityfull of crazies
evolution is a religion change my mind stevencrowder
pornography and casual sex contributes to the moral decline of  america change my mind
its hard to say i am a fan of yours because although you have great viewseducated and logical opinions on a lot of controversial issues you then have opinions like these that are so nonsensical and absurd
i didnt even notice that was not gay jared in the back
well get in one way or another try
it wasnt raining it was raving i dont know if he was saying it eat sleep rave repeat that guy sounds like hes a druggie
dont most illegal immigrants come on planes
have you noticed mexicans just dont seem that bright
steven how do you listen to so much stupidity without laughing in their face some kinda x ray wtf
how do you make it so people dont want to immigrate illegally to the us
as long as topo chico stays in the united statesim fine with the wall
he should work for cnn  makes perfect sense to them what he said
that last guy wow just wow smh
lets just give everyone mandatory gps implants this guys dream is literally the road to hell
couldve quite literally just gotten this woman killed for ratting and asking how to get these people deported lol oh well i commend the young man that wanted to debate even though he was so ridiculous in his thought he gave it a whack he was ignorant to the facts and it was extremely annoying hearing him speak with an inflection on the end of his sentences travel really fastaaa billions and billions of opioidsaaa millions and trillions of dollarsaaa hey but at least he tried to make sense and sound educated hell need that when he runs for governor of nm the look that crowder gave the camera was perfect wtf did i just hear
that spanish dude spends too much time watchibg scifi futuristic movies walk through xray scanners without borders lol
a physical modern day great wall of china is a preposterously costly and wasteful proposition on its face this second speaker may be highly inarticulate but hes probably on to what will actually be implemented in the near future a virtual detection boarder of some kind whether face recognition or god forbid chipping or some yet unforeseen method
wow that guy is asking for the mark of the beast to be embedded in him jesuspleasecomesoon
jesus christ man fucking mental retardation low iq for sure
did you really not have any good discussions on this topic
people always say do it the right way guess what doing it the right way is an extremely long and expensive process if it was easier and cheaper people would be doing it that way more often you think people would rather walk across a desert to get here get real you say trump did not disrespect mexicans that is just not true he literally said that mexico is sending over their bad hombres he called mexicans drug dealers kidnappers and rapists you posted this video yesterday so you must know about what is going on at the border ice is separating kids from their parents and there have been reports of ice agents raping some of the girls should we not let them in our country either all of a sudden sounds like trump and ice are the kidnappers rapists and bad hombres then you want to say how illegal immigrants contribute the most to homicides yet every time i turn on the tv its a white kid shooting up a school or church or a white man shooting up a concert moreover these statistics are skewed because it is definitely proven and said by police officers that they are trained to target people of color look around in jailsprisons most people are not white black people are incarcerated at a rate 5 times higher than whites guaranteed they do the same with hispanicslatinos i understand that safety is one of the top priorities for america as it is essential to maintain our country however it is dishonest and fundamentally wrong to give these garbage reasons to build a wall people think that if the wall is built all of a sudden all of these problems are going to go away regardless drugs and illegal immigrants will always find a way in it just seems to me that trump and his supporters only want the wall built because itll be seen as a victory for america not to mention the symbolism that a wall will imply this is contradictory to the way humanity is heading love unity sustainability and knowledge is what we need this just sets us back
i got an ad for you before this video anyone else
this spanish kid lol make a xray border or something like that well thats going to be cheap
xray gate wow some people are fucking retarded
anybody catch leroys blogvlog i would like to check out how for down the delusional rabbit hole leroy is
xray border nuff said
this guy was fuckin dumb
build an xray vision wall change my mind
that crime rate amongst illegal immigrants is based on doj stats i looked them up
i actually talked to the guy hosting that day i gave him the facts and really shut his view down as respectfully as i could interesting that he only put up the interviews with obviously ill educated people on the subject
you need like an xray scanner so a border no not a border ummmm okay dude
congrats on 2mill subscribers  
1315 says everything you need to know about this change my mind
this episode was pretty meh not at the fault of steven and his team but the people who sat down to talk with him what a terribly annoying group of people
i feel dumber after listening to that guy talk 
that was totally scientifical
you can still see her badge
i agree with the xray wall  maybe a laser wall  ok ok instead of a wall we dig  a motte  and sharks with laser beams on their heads
ouuffthat was difficult to listen to im surprised there were no factoids about the cost of the wall and predicted positive effect i would like to also get some source info on the crime statistics steven put forward because otherwise were all just rounding numbers from undocumented sources from memory to compliment a bias a whole lot of meaningful stuff missing edited
listening to the 2nd guy gave me a headache
the real boss hogs hoggs 
40 of illegal immigrants come here on plane change my mind
he wants us all microchipped and scanned everywhere we go wonder if go green global gets funds from soros
mark of the beast or a wall tough choice i chose wall
building a wall is a waste of money and wont stop people from coming in change my mind
did that guy say his family has been in new mexico since the 1550s wtf lmaoooo this dude is pro globalism and literally retardedyikes
how about you do everybody is treated equal change my mind
hahaha so he wants everyone to get gps implants that is less radical than building a wall
steven i am so amazed how you were able to keep your shit together id be a dribbling pile of hysterical laughter at that point    a return visit from him on your show would be gold  i can see like a 4 yr old type drawing in crayon for his schematics 
the wall built to keep people out will eventually become the wall that keeps us in
building the wall is economically retarded anyone for building the wall doesnt understand how it doesnt change anything people will still enter the country  its a cost sink the only thing we need is a better work visa system
gtk change my mind
i would only agree to a wall as long as that wall covers all 4 sides yes including the east and west coast so that all borders are covered
is it just our southern border that would be walled if so from where to where would the wall span im not asking sarcastically i was kinda hoping it would come up in the video before anyone attacks me my motivation behind the questions or my supposed legal status based off my last name im an american citizen and a veteran my father is also as was his father before him
hes right about the pharmaceutical industry being a bigger problem than other forms of drugs like cocaine or marijuana
an xray scanner border  brillianntddrrrrrrrxyz
i had the biggest fucking grin on my face the entire time that spanish guy was talking
holy fuck  a mexican aka spanish guy named leeroy
i dont live in new mexico but i really hope that guy does not become governor
dude u have every right to defend ur country from illegal immigration but building it will not solve the root of the problem and it will cost billions of dollars the country doesnt have
lmao make them walk through a xray scanner border
scientifical
the only way to fix the immigrant problem coming from mexico is to fix mexico as long as mexico stays fucked up then people will keep coming wall or no wall
man that guy was all over the place x ray border sheesh crowder youve got lots of patience
a xray boarder wtf is that and it would cost way more than just building the wall truth
build the wall i really dont care but mexico will not pay for that wallim mexicani think thats the real problem
i was surprised that no one brought up the fact that the sheer logistics behind building a wall between mexico and the us make it  completely unfeasible and unrealistic
these mexicans are poising our streets with dope getting our kids hooked on drugs if they can respect our laws and come here legally then kick them and their kids out we have starving kids here and homeless vets we need to take care of our own my kids go without and you want me to give more of my paycheck to these people and give a dam about their kids send them packing with their future ms13 kids they dont care about us how our taxes are going to pay for their kids build the wall trump2020 put me on top of the wall and i will make sure no one gets across they are too lazy to rebel against their govenmnet like out ancestors did disrespectfull mexicans can go home come legally or get outtake your kids with you
ooooof here we go bois
whether or not the wall would work is debatable but a problem i see is the walls effects on the region its built in many endangered animals species live along the us mexican border blocking access for these would have serious impacts on animal populations animals on the mexican side would be prevented from breeding with animals on the us side which would reduce genetic diversity and weaken already small and sparse populations human activities have led and are leading to the decline in biodiversity healthy ecosystems and the natural world these things are taken for granted and wont be replacable if we destroy it i dont have a problem with securing the border and preventing illegal immigration but a wall across a one thousand mile border just seems ridiculous
omg what ever state hes in he needs to leave and never go back bc the amout of low iq that i seen was mind boggling tht 2nd guy man
the spanish guy is a dumb ass
is that 2nd guy actually spanish or irish his accent confuses me
how do you tax em drug dealers typically dont report their income
1237 the real boss hog ha love it he just forgot to mentioned or include rosco pico train
x ray border wall
was that guy serious let me get some of what he was smoking dude was talking about masterminds
1st guy is a good example of stupid
its hard to get a coherent statement from some of these people
why do you have fences around your housebackyard its so people dont walts in uninvitedif they want to come in they will need to use the front doorgatelegally
wtf is this kid talking about i still wanna hear his take on the wall
wtf is proper scientifical and this is the future generation of leaders in our country time to move to the hills
props to you my man you always give the other person the benefit of the doubt as if they know what they are talking about this lady even says maybe im confused and your immediate reaction is probably not
that 2nd guy sounds like hes high
spanish guy  dude youre not spanish you dumb bitch   youre either a mexican or american pick one
you cant fix dumb
not gay secret service
do a therapy session for homophobics by superwoman
his stare at the end d d
screw walls i want to tag people with x rays and follow them constantly much better 
fuck trump in mexico i work to hard i no like work so i moved to california land of free  housing free medical free dental  free food stamps free money so fuck racists white people think mexican come to more lawns or work in toco truck  fuck you racists i come for the welfare no welfare for white people or black people just mexican people fuck you racists in california they love mexican people thats wy they give us  welfare so we be happy i never go back to mexico i never stop my welfare so fuck you racists i love hillary and carry brown i love my welfare so fuck you racists
damn dude sounds like hes on drugs now
build the  wall already
god bless you for wasting your time with that idiot an xray wall yea im sure thatll be much cheaper 
tag and release
good interview with the first woman
freaking hilarious this guys been thinking about this for three years and thats what hes come up with
second guy ive been into politics a long periodically time
a country is defined by having borders if anyone ever thinks that the borders will go away you are delusional at best haha
2nd dude throws an e on every word its quite annoying hes probably illegal himselfand hes proposing essentially rfid chips into humans what a fucking idiot
603 you worded that pretty poorly lol
cant even finish with this idiot
of all these stupid things he came up with i almost missed that he said hes been pondering this for 3 years
that blogger guy is advocating for a police state
that guy from spain is a illegal imagrant for sure u can tell by how he talks
soooo the 2nd guys argument is not to build a wall but to install a big brotheresque tracking system wow
i have been repeatedly impressed with crowders ability to maintain a poker face as people unreel the most laughable gobbledygook never more than now when the guys who drive by and hurl pejoratives offer more substance than the guy who sits down to have a talki has a sad if that kid ever buckles his energy and enthusiasm onto something worthwhile like learning a thing or two he could go places
i cant
im from new mexico and these liberal policies are ruining this great state  we are second to last in the nation when it comes to education top 5 in violent crimes 1st in vehicle theft and there is a growing heroin problem  the police force has dwindled to the point that there is not a large enough force to properly enforce the law the courts release criminals including violent criminals on the regular with no jail time  they issue a house arrest instead with an ankle braclet  this has happened so often that we ran out of ankle braclets and there is not enough resources or people to track them that its normal to find cut ankle braclets  all the entitlement programs are bankrupting the state and yet we continue to vote in democrats at the peril of destroying a unique and beautiful state
there are 6 months left till 2019 stop and think for a moment
lmfao that look at the end
the second person suggests we watch more scifi movies
build the prison and lock the keys lets forget about american dreams so the rest of the world can dream again
libs claim building a wall that long and over mountains isnt possiblethe bolder is just under 2000 miles long the great wall of china is over 13000 miles long and over mountains sochina can do it in 1368 but america cant do one a fraction the size in 2018 riiiight
this series has tackled many topics that dont have talking about it im a open minded person and try to see both sides of an argument steven crowder has the right to his opion but is still open for people to change that opion thats why i watch this channel we have the right to think anyway we feel even if its not the popular way of thinking i feel we shouldnt build a wall i dont think we have the money to build it and maintain the wall thats just me change my mind
leroy trejo sounds pretty smart for a dumb guy
any illegal aliens who give me free weed and tequila are welcome in my country anytime stillbuildthewalltho
so dont build the wall but chip and xray everyone wtf
second guy did 4 lines of coke before walking up to the table
i didnt get the notification that you actually went out and did this holy shit dude lol
this guys a nutcase he only ever talks to people less intelligent than him so it appears hes more right or logical because those people cant back up their reasons with proper claims despite those claims existing but unable to be expressed by that person due to their incompetence with articulating their thoughts and shit like that
before i watch this video i want to note that i cross the border every single day and have witnessed people trying to illegally cross through the international bridges the current wall works there is no need for a bigger or stronger wall my suggestion is to have more border patrol agents monitoring the borders  besides there are some places that is impossible to build the wall such as high mountains steep mounts or just hard terrain cbp knows that they cant build one continuous wall  also there are a lot of us private properties that intersect with the wall and in these places the us gov cant build anything so there are gaps anyways i wont argue about the kind of people coming in to the us and their intentions because i dont have the data for that in conclusion a new note my emphasis in new wall is just a massive waste of money instead the us should hire more border patrol agents and have better technology for surveillance here is a page with statistics regarding the us illegal immigration  httpswwwstatistacomstatistics646261unauthorizedimmigrantpopulationintheus  it has data up until 2014 but it gives an idea of how it has been reducing since 2007 the year the border wall was built the wall reduced the influx of illegals from 12 million to 11 million and it has fluctuated ever since but stayed as 11 million dhs should focus on the virtual wall as the cbp calls it not on physical walls
come to ferris state university next year
his family has been in new mexico since the 1550s
1317 hahahaha says it all actually i wonder what ben shapiro would have said haha
not sure if leroy understood with out a wall or some other form of barrier people who want to bypass the xray check points is going to just go around them anyways
how stupid does people have to be not to see that america is being invaded in mass numbers by 3rd world immigrantskinda like the rest of western civilization across the world all by design smh
the second guy take this mark in your hand or forehead and then you can cross the border and get jobs hmmmsound an awful lot like something ive read in the bible
mandatory drug tests for change my mind guests  change my mind
rip big van vader
perhaps call it this is your brain on drugs
leroy is a globalistagenda 21 supporter in the making he probly wants chips implanted
i would think ear tags like a deer would be more cost effectivethan the mark of the beast xray chip thing the future gov of nm mentioned
i just realized technically 100 of illegal immigrants are criminals they are labeled as illegal for a reason coming into the united states illegally is the crime they all commit
wow this should be retitled what public schools produce jeepers
hey steven can you reupload this or something to change her voice and blur the id card im worried about her
so that idiot wants us all chipped and tracked riiiiiiiiiight thats better than a wall freaking idiots
who can have a productive conversation with people whom have very little grasp of the issue
ive lost faith in humanity
congress will not approve trumps wall so now he is butthurt
why dont we just make everyone get barcode tattoos and then set up conveyor belts all along the border and when someone wants to come in they just hop on the conveyor and get scanned in like my groceries at walmart
wow  this is sad  we as americans would not tolerate the government tracking our every move as this guy seemed to be willing to concede without them even asking  that is a new problem i had not even considered with the immigrant mindset and them being able to vote in laws that encroach on our personal freedoms
in my college class today my professor had us do a mock debate the topic question should illegal immigrants be given a drivers license we had to stand on one side of the room if we agreed the other if we disagreed and in the middle of we were unsure i stood firm on my belief that no they should not the main reason being that they are illegal immigrants why should they be given the rights and privileges given to actual law abiding american citizens when in the first place by being here illegally they are breaking he law of course the one girl that was on the agree side started crying and told a heart breaking personal story so i looked like the bad guy  ridiculous
new mexico is my city  random spanish guy
of course thats the dumbass that represents us in new mexico you need to prescreen these people first
stopped lifting crowder
that dude was a complete dipshit
theres already a border ok 
these people are dumb
i remember my first trip to america
god help us if he is elected governor
a lot of mexicans hate their own
these videos make me doubt humanity people are so oblivious
so cringy
this is the stupidest video on change my mind so far
the great wall of america is coming folks and it will be great
trump 2020
the wall would raise americans taxes
that spanish dude was dumb as shit or high as shit i dunno which it was or maybe both
the first man he clearly doesnt understand that if theres no wall you cant make sure they get documented
that 2nd guy was really hard to listen to  seems like he was all over the place mentally
why is he talking like thissssaahhh
i think borders in general are going to become a thing of the past think again buddy americans will not be going along with the globalist agenda 21 dude has a lot to learn lol
the second guy wants a xray scanning mark of the beast type of thing lol
its okay to double dip change ma mind bra
how do you keep a straight face when you interview a guy like the future governor there  ive lived in santa fe and it was like trying to get a job in a slave state they have displaced and put  so many carpenters builders and skilled labor workers out of work there that its hard to believe the going wage for framing houses there last time i checked was 1015 hour 15 being the highest i saw thats 3hr less than the going rate of 1820 from the late 1980salso santa fe is an extension of hollywood ive never been around a thicker concentration of hateful hippies in my life this kid is spanish the local northern new mexicans were a lot more down to earth but occasionally their fierce prejudice against mexicans not latinos but nationally mexicans would rear its ugly head its one of the only real prejudices i have witnessed living in this state
you know what build that wall itll prove that it will not protect you in any form lol
that lady didnt even know what the hell she was saying
lmfaoyeah lets not have a wall but lets just fucking x ray peoplelmaoi dont really think a wall would be effective myself and think its a waste of money butthis kidmy god lol
i promise normal hispanic people dont think like that idiot
im not a feminist change my mindor maybe feminism is evil or something along those lines
stupid imaginary wall lol people  everyone of us have  ancestors that are immigrants or are a immigrants do not be a  ignorant fuk  when you divide a house there will be war  in the house now boom ignorant cowards
why wouldnt people just go around the walllike uhh in the ocean i would just take a boat
remember when he got triggered at the autistic lol
why make healthcare or education better here when we can put that money into building a giant wall along the southern border and create a space force lol
the wall will slow an almost stop illegal immigration into america on the southern border fact these ppl are dumb
what youve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard at no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul
no way in hell that second guy is spanish lol i think he meant hispanic though
a massive xray gate isnt that a wall
i dont understand why you cant interview decent people who are educated on the issues and share the same opinions as the majority of people who oppose you you only interview stupid people to make yourself feel smart and to make the democratic party look stupid please make videos that are fair thx
stevenwhen people say a wall wont work check out hungary  they had a huge problem built a wall stopped 99  you should do a segment on the hungarys wall  it is a very close situation as we have and how they solved it with a wallalso another bad  reason not to build a wall i hear is it will take so long what is the point which is a stupid point had we started building a wall 10 years ago we wouldnt be having the issues we have today    my only issue with the wall i wonder if it needs to be so expensive  look at the wall hungary built it is effective  why shouldnt we model a fence like hungarys using a lower cost fence with sensors which detect foot traffic cameras drones  i wonder why a hungary type fence would not work here  in hungary it is also felony with stiff prison terms for damaging the fence
im really sad you dont list sources in the description cant find those numbers on the illegal immigrant homicide anywhere im not justifying it but i would like sources
man they say your own people are the biggest enemy and i see its true
im actually against the wall myself  do not believe it would actually solve the problem  we have stories of actual criminals that are receiving little to no help at all breaking out very secure prisons  if something like that is possible i dont think its going to be all that difficult for a freeman to gather  the resources he needs to get past the wall
grats on 2m subs crowder keep up the great work
have them write a note of why theyre here yeah i could see that pedro out in the middle of the dessert at the us mexico border where theres no fence or checkpoint writing a little note leaving it on the ground and going on his merry way xd
the wall cant resolve anything thats the only argument you need if you think the expensive shitty wall is a good idea at this point you are just completely stupid andor ignorant
crowder glad you did this one most antiwall people ive talked too all seem to have the mental block that a wall cant have gates and doors most also think that wall supporters are all antiimmigrant and antitrade once these two things get exposed the vast majority of these people cant go further i like to use airport security as an example to quickly get through these delusions to real meaningful facts of border security
clearly not a master minded individual i like the tagging of illegals though
why are people so dumb the ladys iq was up in the s compared to that illiterate spaniard
i think xray vision would help to see into someones soul and decide if they are like worthy of being here  tax them anyway  im going to run for governor too so i can make a law that everyone has to be scanned and stuff
the most epic part of the whole video 1000  watch this dude malfunction and twitch out
almost every country in the eu has a wall border why cant we so weird they pick and choose things they like remember kids life is not a build a bear workshop
dont build the wall435 oo you know what build it
that bitch cray
electronic id tag umm like an rfid chip so we give up even more privacy than we already have
borders will become a thing of the past lol because the us and mexico are pretty much the same thing
steven this woman needs to be covered with a black box and her voice doctored a face blur isnt going to keep her safe from the people who watch this
this was so frustrating to listen to what if we visit family how do we get back in  you gotta make a path to citizenshipthen just make them pay taxes  are you serious
i am guessing that stupid people go on camera because they do not know they are stupid
sorry people descended from spain apparently yall are all retarded
theses people werent that bright
ok so the second guy was talking about tagging them like the way they do animals you know like the when scientists capture an animal tag them and then release them back into the wild so they can monitor them
lmao he just embarrassed himself and made himself look really ignorant
the ol steven bullshit percentages coming into play really grinds my gears
xray border priceless
at least the second guy knows hes no mastermind
i wonder what kind of dystopian novels leo has been reading
its almost like they all know we need a wall but they dont want to admit it because they hate trump so much
i think that if youre an illegal immigrant you should get nothing no welfare food stamps free healthcare we need to make it as miserable as possible for them if theyre not getting free stuff and theyre not getting to work and make money then perhaps the american dream wont look so good to them also i think if somebody hires an illegal immigrant they should get their business taken away we need to make it so that its not worth the risk to these people
borders will become a thing of the past once we discover an extraterrestrial civilization its not going to and it shouldnt happen before then
low iq
422 let me assert my position because there might be areas here we disagree vs where we disagree yes definitely crowder 
alright lmafo these are getting out of hand
you cant fix illegal immigration with concrete and steel you do it with a pen and paper the only way to reduce illegal immigration is by making legal immigration easier a wall isnt going to do anything except drive up the number on the debt counter
as someone who is somewhat protrump and very anti illegal i think the wall is a terrible idea the much better idea would be a massive crackdown on all employers im talking massive incremental punitive action for anyone caught employing illegals if you make it too painful for companies to hire illegals they wont do it even if they would otherwise want to and the gov can pocket a nice chunk of change on the side if they dont have and cant get jobs they will stop coming and more importantly go home something the wall does not make happen
the 2nd guy is basically talking about a wallborder concept sigh and he wants to be a future govenor note to self stay away from new mexico
in 50s announcer guy voice yes guest citizen welcome to america with the power of radar
if you dont have borders then you dont have a country
rip x
the war on drugs is such a crock of shit weve had american troops defending the poppy fields over in the middle east and the government was caught running guns down into mexico in exchange for drugs the cia are the biggest drug dealers in the world
quiero la pared manana trump is a good man who wants to protect us from losing our sovereignty i came to this country years ago and i understand why trump wants to build the wall the wall is the antithesis of the north american union meaning merging three countries and turning them into one nation rule by parliaments the globalist not just want to transform north america but south america too for the union of south americas this is dangerous preposition for all western citizens once all of america is transformed then the new world order will be set through the united nations turning every nation into a communist systems govern by the globalist wake up america before is too late  httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv3ngjamgzse              httpsenwikipediaorgwikinorthamericanunion      httpsenwikipediaorgwikiunionofsouthamericannations
steven crowderi am a leftist build the wallpick one
pray for new mexico if this guy ever becomes governor
did that woman with the blurred face have a plant in her drink
you should censor the ladys id around her neck
i think that last guy makes sense  give them legal citizenship and add a tax as punishment for breaking the law  solving our boarder problem with technology rather then a archaic wall also is a great idea
that was mind numbing but expected as anyone against building the wall will be low iq
came for the wall stayed for the walther
sooo how is the government supposed to tax people they dont know are here
yes definitely spend three quarters of a trillion dollars on xray machines that scan your id
the lack of logic on that last guy was a pretty spectacular thing to beholdand extremely annoying
how can you be against a border wall yet for tagging people so you can scan them electronically
steves face at the end priceless lol
i am mexicanamerican born in texas raised in mexico by mexican parents i study and work in the us i cross the border almost every day i want the wall built
that guy was not helping himself at all
the fuck is this guy talking about
second guy is homosexual or on coke or both definitely gay
wow was leroy tringo tweaked out on flaka or something wtf was that he spoke complete insanity
steven crowder and his followers are a collection of jackasses
what in the hell is the second guy even talking about im dying this shit is ridiculous
right crowder  i saw that look you arent kidding wow what a loose cup cake
how about they fix their own goddamn country so we dont have to build the fucking wall
shockingly dumb people
whats the wall going to do when theres a bunch of tunnels it is wrong for illegal immigration but is it really going to stop the problem by building a physical wall cuz i dont think it will and it just going to cost us a bunch of money
that edited part is fishy you never edit things
the people that pass by and just yell are proof that liberals are unable to have a reasonable discussion then again what do you expect from tall babies
could you please post your source for the illegal immigrant violent crime and homicide rate thanks in advance
its the kalergi plan white genocide httpstwittercomredpillthreadstatus991866611182292992
i think this boy has had his share of pharmaceuticals governor of new mexico now thats a real dreamer at best this guys going to flip burgers at the local burger king for the rest of his life
i wonder what mastermind individuals would be able to invent this xray database that could successfully establish this scientificle idea 
xraygate is trending lol
just have stations where people crossing the boarder can show up and shoot a chip into their neck  seems reasonable
i praise you mr crowder for doing the lords work with these helpless souls
people who think with their feelings dont always argue for the wrong thing but they always argue for what smarter people manipulate them into feeling its not about taxing immigrants its about crime increasing and undercutting american wages then they vote for the same policies that made their countries a place they need to flee fromwe dont have enough jobs homes or schools for everyone the country cannot support more people
most immigrants come by airplane so the wall would waste a lot of money
that second guy was at least well mannered but man 0 critical thinking skills public schoolcommon core at its finest
people are not prioritizing the right way they think that whatever way they prioritize is the right way because its their life but its selfish people not prioritizing their thoughts correctly because of distractions is whats wrong with the world today especially in the united states its scary to the people who do prioritize their thoughts correctly this video shows that people have the ability to think critically but where they get most of their information is wrong the internet was sold water is bottled and sold electricity is free but sold people dont grow their own food anymore and rely on the next person get out while you can people theres no fixing this its too late
ummmmmmm your male quest was coked up
shouldnt you have blured the woman out more maybe even modified her voice arent you putting her safety at risk by uploading a video showcasing her natural voice hair and body shape i would think the people shes talking about whom are from the same apartment complex as she would recognize her in no time from watching this video
that spanish guy really likes to listen himself talk even if it do not make any sense
whats a wall going to doever heard about el chapo and his posse tunnelswhat about the wright brotherssee where im going with thisboats
319 she said loan shark money lendingnot laundering those captions were wrong pending and laundering arent exactly the same thing
dont build a wall build an xray wall that scans people when they cross the xray wall seems legit
is that guy suggesting a 1954 mile xray border a huge database that collects all the information of all the people passing through and a chip inside people with a gps
what is the source for the illegal immigrant homicide statistic
that second guy im fully against building the wall but i cant agree with him cus he has no idea what hes talking about pick an intellectual to debate for once crowder
youd have to be retarded to think a wall will keep cartels out
that guy not one thing he spoke dealt with build the wall lost in his own words
the idea leroy had is so on the line of sciencefiction its crazy lmao not to mention it would be a huge violation of peoples privacy
is it just me or is a wall way less oppressive than an xray border with mandatory tagging of citizens and noncitizens alike wscanner network keeping tabs on peoples locations i think the kid was trying so hard to seem opposed to evil trumps policy that he accidentally suggesting something way more horrible
xray scanner dude like really like stupid like yah   i can see the civil rights organizations tearing this guy apart what a tard like go smoke some more weed  dude
the 2nd person i agree with to an extent we should give the law abiding ones a chance to become a citizen however my view is when even an illegal immigrant is found the first time process them get their prints and dna and create a record on them tell them how to renter the country legally provide them with the paperwork and some pamplets on the process then deport them if they are caught a 2nd time in the country illegally tell tem they are now banned from renetering the country and deport them if they are caught a 3rd time execution that sounds harsh but 3rd strike and your out obviously this person will just keep breaking back into the country and sincetheir country obviously isent going to stop them we mustbut the wall should be built we need a physical barrier to help stop them no it wont stop them all but it will stop a lot and make it easier to catch them while making the attempt
this guy is going to revolutionize xray technology one day
changing your mind is never going to happen because you have it bolted shutno border laws no drug lawsperiodit creates the problem and not fixes anything
this guy argued his point extremely poorly
tax them does thst include a tax on the many forms of welfare they already receive
oh come on i was waiting for a real change my mindbtw can you try to debate someone that has an iq in the triple digit range
that guy is a dumbass
call in the masterminds
that second dude has been watching to much star trek and sci fi movies lately come back to 2018 buddy
this is the second time ive gotten an ad for steven crowder on his own channel
the first guy with the microphone was he high or just really stupid
thats just like your opinion man
the spainish james hetfield  people are gonna be traveling super fastahh todays standardsaahh  any money they makeahh  this guy talks fast and has no clue about context or having a adult conversation talks real fast in the way a kid explains why he wants a new bike mildly retarded if you ask me
people read libtards democrats see build the wall and their brain changes it to keep all mexicans out its very hard for many people to see past that i hope its even harder for illegals to see past the wall
female privilege is real change my mind
that guy was speaking complete scyfy this xray border doesnt exist and would not work as much as a physical wall
i would love to have a conversation with you regarding this topic and maybe change your mind
make it tallmake it beautiful
her face is on her id badge
the second guy is on a lot of drugs which caused him to fly faaaar away from his rocker and hit his head on a hard wall xray border he is never going to be the governor of new mexico
the second guy basically wants a rfid chip implanted in everyone so the govt can track you
personally i dont think building the wall is necessary because just how the argument that criminals will still commit crimes even though there are laws i feel that illegal immigration will still take place just in other more harsh and profound ways its sad that you werent able to get an actual argument as to why the wall shouldnt be built but if you want real insight from people i would think have actual arguments and opinions on the matter then you should visit mcallen tx or any of the surrounding areas
that dude sounds stupid what are you on idiot
mexican american for trump my family is from jalisco became citizens i was born in california never on welfarebuild the wall common sense come legally
before i even listen to the video big thumbs up to the guy with the death from above tshirt on  well done sir well done indeed
why is mexico so bad in the first place to the point where their citizens want to get the hell out of there is the real issue not the government of mexico what is mexico doing
im about 2 minutes into leroys bitthis is the definition of incoherent rambling im scared that such uninformed people can vote
first
some kinda electronic id tag
its easy to change your mind on this one we are 21 trillion dollars in debt fix the welfare state and drug war and you fix illegal immigration wall is useless and irresponsible based on those two things
the stupid mexican guy starts bringing up tax when he mentions building the wall and immigration wtf
x ray border scientifical plans to be governor of new mexico for the last 3 years hes a big dreamer for sure
the second guy should stop wasting time trying to act smart and should be looking for his missing chromosome
homie talking sci fi shit
how does he sit there listening to their bs way more patient then i am
sneaky jared
building a wall seems like a topical fix to a larger issue the main issue at hand isnt that people are crossing illegally its why people are crossing the border these people are often terrified to live where they do or see opportunity in america building a wall doesnt fix that creating a better process for legal immigration is the best long term solution
leroywtf are you even talking about
hey crowder you forgot to blur out her pass she has around her neck
i cant wait to see the next mayor of new mexico on a ballot his conspiracy theories on why he lost the election will be comic gold
is that an r32 in the back
sure lets make everyone in the whole world citizens what could go wrong
that last guy actually didnt have a horrible idea but the tweek is drones that shoot id tags into illegal border crossers
idk but that statistic about illegal immigrants committing over a third of all homicides in the country sounds like bs
zionist shill crowder does not really want a wall unless his jewish masters tell him to want one
personally i dont see the point of building a wall the majority of illegals come here legally they just never leave and beyond that walls have failed twice before in history i dont believe this is a third times the charm kind of situation just ask china and the french im sure the nazis and huns would agree
i am probably the only one who realizes this but by picking a topic and randomly asking people out on the street to comment on it one that you have clearly researched in advance you are asking people who dont deal with politics much or who have simple ideas i just dont like the idea of a wall being an example and then using that research to attack what they say because they dont have that backup knowledge you have prepared for a debate and given them zero time to prepare this is good entertainment sure and im certain most people here love seeing triggered lefties but trump supporters seem mental the same way people here do when put on the spot and asked to profess their beliefs in an unfiltered way
build a wall around yourself
that was impossible to watch please go back to college campuses at least there im not cringing at the obviously retarded guy that you sat down with here
1103 lol an x ray gate that just like reads your id when your there
im against building the wall but these are some of the dumbest things ive ever heard
dude i would of lost my shit talking to this dumb ass guest
second guy describing the new terminator movie
dont build the wall too expensive tax could have been use on other stuff or hire more people to guard the permitter idc tbh not my money
its like this guy trys so hard to be hated
that guy was off his meds lol
i am very curious to know how many people that oppose the wall live in gated communities or fenced in yards
just use the obama era obamaphones send them to mexico and use those to track illegal immigrants kappa
this guy is willing to give up his individual rights in order for the government to follow immigrants via everyone being tracked its insane and people clap its madness what has happened to the world these people constantly make excuses for the agenda zero facts its nuts why dont they awake with the counterargument my god how cant they acknowledge the factual argument and not see sense i cant understand it i figured it out emotion
dat crowder face at the end makes this video so worth it xd
the wall at the border is the same as a front door on your homei like my front door especially when im sleeping
scientifical
ahh the liberalization of west texas  soon itll be as broke as commiefornia
drugsuh fastuh yearsuh testuh yesuh
i support trump  change my mind
razorfist did a video on this topic a while back  just build the damn wall already i say
you couldve brought up cost of the wall you couldve brought up daca you could have brought up the role illegal immigrants play in farming and the economybut noxray borders designed by masterminds
leroy is a fucking moron
that guy said his family has been in new mexico since the 1550sthat doesnt make any since that part of america wasnt explored until the 1800s
this guy just described the tracking system from gattaca
the second guy talks so much but completely says nothing with significant value
haha xray border lets just distribute cancer
i likeeed itaaaaa
dont build a mic stand change my mind
has anyone ever changed this guys mind
we shouldnt have a wall but rather this this xrayscanning machine that scans everything and everyone who passes it so what well have this gaint sign in the middle of the border saying scan here for citizenship or is it going to be a machine that extends along the entire border
good lord xray border
steven i dont like something about this series it seems like you are setting pedestrians up for failure im glad you are fuzzing their face btw you come very prepared to debate and random people come up passionate but not ready and look like fools do you announce your plans to sit down
lee roy trujillo is one first class idiot with no idea what he is talking about
you are demonitized boiii
immigrants dont bring drugsa
give all the mexicans shock collars that shock them at the border would work just as well as the xray border
building the wall would fuck over america and cause mayor debt
im 100 certain that the man being interviewed is high   agree or disagree
i appreciate that leroy was respectfulalthough his ideas were not good
many times people who are against the wall think that trump wants to deport everyone and not open a pathway to citizenship they do not realize that a border wall incentivizes immigrants to gain citizenship opening the border allows anyone to bring anything into the country without any regulation there isnt a country in the world that does that i am not against immigration my familys ancestry are immigrates i am against illegal immigration i do not know why that is such a difficult concept for people to understand
governor leroy jenkins sure cant wait to blast some illegal immigrants with gamma rays maybe a wall around new mexico will suffice
i cant watch this i dont support a border but these people dont know how to debate this issue
wow this first dude is retarded  making new mexicans look bad  were not all that dumb but there are a lot of them like that here unfortunately
i didnt know xrays could log passcodes that was a surprise how leroy managed to tie his shoelaces now thats a mystery
what where is this 37 illegal immigrant homicide rate from that was pulled out of nowhere
what a waste of time
 this dude is describing orwellian nightmare so funny not
if your here legally u wont have to worry about getting deported when you call the police for help that simple
xray borders are the future every home and store will have an xray border xd
most illegal immigrants are not from illegal passes in to the usa but overstays of visas immigration reform is key but a wall will be a waste of money and symbolizes  american isolationism money should be put in checking on people or the control of people with visas also with isolationism america will give china the upper hand in being a global leader and it only increases with the trade wars nato handling of trump and resigning from paris accords and tpp
the physical wall is stupid af not border protection
stop the wall build an xray borderlegit retarded
nice go ahead and cherry pick those who cant form coherent argument all countries have to deal with illegal immigration and have their own ways to curb it but building a wall is dumb because its ineffective and costly anyone for building a wall please feel free to change my mind by coming up with a specific plan to fund and build the wall and how it will actually stop illegal immigration ill be waiting
my only concern is that many wild animals cross true both countries to either mate or just simply eat the wall would but a lot of pressure on these already pressured animals im all for having proper immigration laws but it cant only be about people animals are just as important environmental issues are my only problem with trump
omfg the leroy dude plans on being the governor of new mexico and still uses made up words like scientifical im concerned to say the least
where can i find sources that backup the statistics you mention about illegal immigrant crimes 
im just a cheap prick    but i would like to buy a mug  anyway that second guy does he want everyone to have a barcode an rfdi chip the mark of the beast and all that hoopla keep up the cool work
this land was stolen from native americans is just a matter of time for them to take over it any time now
xray scanners sound fucking awesome if only they could exist at such a large scale as a borderlong wall
dammit leeroyedit is this guy really suggesting that everyone get an id code imprinted on them for an xray scanner that sounds like mark of the beast antichrist type shit no thanks guy
wow great idea leroy lets microchip every mexican citizen and keep track of their comings and goings with an xray border thats the kind of idea that will sweep leroy into the new mexican governors mansion if trump did that tm the left would say that he is microchipping them like animals and politicians on the left would cry because its so cruel this is why you cant take anyone on the left seriously leroy needs a brain scan and to read more
its been a while since steven has interviewed someone with a sub80 iq until now faith in the existence of stupid people still being on earth is restored lol
holy shit holy fucking shit
that guy sounds intelligent enough to be the governor of new mexico
an xray border
that first older lady is the perfect type of person ice would love to have as an informant as long as they could ensure her safety she would most likely be able to name dozens of illegal immigrants to deport
leroy proposed a lot of expensive and dangerous ideas
lmaaoo that beginning
wow steven crowder your a dummy first of all the entire country was put together illigally we massacred all the native americans and we took half of mexicos land also nefariously now go fuck yourself and go back to canada you fucken dumb ass now convince me you are not retarded
why is steven wearing checkered vans
that kid is an idiot
steven you need to debate some actually competent people these people are certifiably retarded
that guy being interviewed had a low iq why make a checkpoint that people can walk around 100 yards down from you need a wall to protect people from bypassing your checkpoint and exploiting your entire system that quest was really fucking dumb to be honest and im not just trying to throw the word dumb out there to discredit him he had some really stupid thoughts in his brain which cant work on paper or in real life
that gentleman was cartoonishly dumb im no genius and im not just dismissing him as an idiot because of his opinions but god damn he couldnt have come up with less informed answers if he tried illegal immigration problem bam make them legal and tax them thanks thats solved now i have an idea for americas economy lets have everyone earn a lot of money wow this is easy
cringy af
mexicans whine about racism in america but mexicans are actually more racist towards other immigrants from south american countries in mexico i say they are far more racist and aggressive towards others trust me both of my parents are from mexico and they told me all about this shit i had no clue about this 
lmaoo blurred out her face but not her face on the id
build the fucking wall  
only a couple of them wont pay taxes lmao hundreds of thousands already dont pay paxes
surely leroy didnt post that video lmao i wonder if he watched itthis later and realized how dumb he sounded  i plan on being the governor of new mexico one day so yeah
as licensed healthcare professional i must concede that there are some serious issues with the people in this video and liberals in general victimology is a sickness
we need like a xray border  if this is the logic antiwall people use then they dont deserve to have a say in it
it sounds like that guy is advocating a 1000mile long invisible fence like you would have for your pets
stop getting on peoples faces like you want to kiss them
wtf is this guy talking about how can steven keep a straight face through this xray id checking border future governors idea
i think that last guy was actually retarded
the first lady got destroyed in the first 5 minutes hahah
liberalism is a mental disorder change my mindit was joke damn calm down
423 we might find some areas where we disagree versus areas where we disagree
wow that second guy is legit retarded
hi im a cheap prick that would watch your daily show but cant afford it 3
opiates are an issue but this guy is just nuts t
you need to come to massachusetts
that be a good gubernatorial race
mr crowder thank you for bringing to light how stupid people are  id like to think if the 2nd simpleton who spoke watched himself speaking he would realize how much of a moron he sounds like but he most likely is sharing the video to his ignorant fans claiming he owned steven in a debate keep them coming boss i love to see and listen to the tolerant non hateful liberals and their general views of the fantasy world they live in morons all of themkeep up the hard work crowder crew thank you
the worst thing is that this is the best interview that they got on this day
these community talks do nothing but make the red or blue team your pandering to smile over peoples comments who arent prepared with well thought out points and arguments for a debate i would be more interested in 2 like minded people on the subject with opposing views debate this is just silly
hahahahahaha could not believe this one wasnt scripted ahahahha
yeah give em all 
how do you not start laughing with the things this guy says lol
hahahaha x ray scanner
borders will be a thing of the past borders have protected civilization since their inception the day borders are done away with is the day the world will fall into chaos there is a reason things are the way they are because they are the best way to keep things running smoothly this explosion of social activism is destroying modern society why would i want to accept someone who talks down to me because of something that someone who only looks like me said why should i care about the feelings of those who claim i hurt them by simply  existing some if we make it that long the country will look back at this time as the perfect example of how societies should not try to be
what surprised me is how much people dont know about the subject and you can tell they have not thought it through
nice indians hat ngj  cle love
0010 wht in the only fff
xray border
why are your videos becoming shorter 
im from santa fe too and this guy is actually pretty far right compared to these idiot lefties here  they think like that guy too  an x ray border  omg these people dont realize reality
bruh nothin against mexicans but this one here is an idiot at some point i started thinking wtf is he talking about
yes a lot of mexicans are hard working as fuck but many bring drugs crime ect into our country on top of that it is illegal and morally wrong to jump the border as you are so called cutting the line of people waiting to get into our country
the debate with the second guy is how debates should be even tho i dont agree with that guyi agreed with steven this entire video he wasnt making it a violent debate and where people would just make insults towards steven like in the past
that dude is fuckin idiot
hahaha xrays
that was painful
ask a lib if they have a fence around there house
that face at the end says it all
send them all back
im not mexican my family is spanish lmao pinche puto maricon looks more mexican than i do
dude in the white shirt was high
xray border 
leroy is contradicting himself he said he doesnt want to go a wall and doesnt believe in borders yet he says that there should be an xray border with advance chips that could be picked up by sensors and also allowing the person to enter a reason to enter which is free flowing so wouldnt that just be like having a wall and a port of entry with people holding passport and visa to get in legally
do a global warming isnt real change my mind
i saw him in austin  hes buffer than he looks
build the wallyou cant have everyone single person live here in the us the country can not afford it the country would go under we our already 20 trillion in debt and this the illegal to the economy is wrong more money is being spent on illegals then the money they put back into the country california is already an example of uncontrolled immigration policy by the state crime and homeless rate are skyrocketing
that was painful
i want boarders these dumb people who do not want boarders do not know how to see the bigger picture of being a world government mob voting world be completely abused since there is way more idiots then smart people
here ill give you a good reason why building a wall is pointless these people will avoid  the wall if it becomes too much a deterrent which leads the sea routes open to get used or they smuggle people like they have been through trucks having the sea route cross it would be much more heartbreaking for when migrants boat across in the thousands and half of them die in stormy conditions vs them trying to get in through known passages  unless we will also have a sea wall built too which will disrupt ship trading too or we will have more boarder watching with the coastal guards these people are desperate to cross the boarder to escape something that we do not understand i think we need to find out why they are crossing and see what we can do to aid their situation for the real solution why are we not seeing canadians crossing our boarders as much as the mexicans obviously something is wrong there but in the end this could be an issue with capitalism as they go to the places where labor is the cheapest and in mexico they have some dirt cheap laboralso unfortunately the guys response about an xray boarder will not prevent someone from leaving their tag away from them or taken it out how do we detect these people then you got to do something to prevent it cause once someone finds a way to break something that word spreads even with a written response now you need someone to read so you do need some border agency to do that job then there is the other implementations of not having a boarder now the us will send its army to mexico cause boarders are a non existent thing and will only start up conquest in the modern day and fights about who owns what part of land that and plus i dont think many of these people understand that most migrants that come here send money back to mexico so now we are losing that money that are not going back into our economy and being sent to a different one that is a parasite and it is only going to keep growing here is a benefit though a lot of our gdp comes from economic migrants buying americans goods cause they are extremely cheap here vs the extremely high taxed items that they sell there on the black markets so some of our gdp comes from these migrants who vacation and fund their vacation through buying goods that are expensive and under cuts their markets there because of high taxes ive talked to hundreds of people like this they tend to buy gaming consoles and technology when they do this cause those are items that are highly taxed on
i hear people say they pay taxes and put money in the community but i know for a fact most mexicans and south americans send most of the money to their families back home that is why many live in huge groups in one house that is not helping our countries economy i know a few mexicans who have 2 to 3 houses in mexico they bought from working fast food here that is most definitely not helping the us economy but rather helping the mexico economy
the most impressive part of this entire video was stevens ability to maintain a straight face
that second guy sucks he doesnt know shit about western life and wants to telll us how to live while he is illegal these people are legit crazy
dont waste your time with the retards
so the spanish kid toward the end of the video is essentially saying he wants to keep strangers and criminals and thieves from coming into his house and only let people in that hes okay with but he doesnt want his house to have any walls or doors or windows yeah that makes perfect sense
and this is why we need a wall
that guy was a hoot
actual retards
he is trying to mislead people with misleading questionsthe reason why the wall doesnt work is simpleillegals come over via airplanes and overstay their visathere are many ways to get into the country without going over the border wallspeople can still climb or go under the wall its not rocket science the wall will not deter peoplethere are already walls in place along the most trafficked areas along the border why are we wasting money to rebuild a wall thads already therea wall without patrols is useless there are already patrols so the wall wont make it any harder or cheaperit cost money to maintain the wall its not freemind changed 
1315  perfect
i think it would be good for people that are skeptical that you might be deceptively editing these that you might want to put up the full unedited version up somewhere yeah it would be a lot of nothing going on for a good portion of it but it would sway any naysayers
i would have to talk with a group of individuals like goverment funded think tank so we work it out fuck these people
we could like i dont know electronically tag them or something sure we could tag everyone else in the world with cattle tags easy just a big yellow tag in ear so we knew where they all were at any given moment not like the mark of the beast or anything mark of the cow well
maybe have some magic chip that sees if youre legal or not holy shit these  fucking people really arent sending their best
yeah yeah a magic xray machine type thingy that will work leroy should be deported for being a dumbazz
just make them pass the coursesum ok how just make them
xray gate really you mean a scanner  you still need a check point that makes people go through it people in cults dont know there in cults mp
i work with mexicans everyday and the people i work with are for the most part hard working people i dont know if theyre here legally or not i do think we need border security
regardless of how well the people argued against him its still retarded to actually think that building a physical wall along the entire freaking border is a good idea
if that guy ever becomes governer of arizona we are exiling the whole state
steven because i wanna make sure crowder
an xray border
this one was kinda boring
you know what fuck it lets make that guy governor because im really curious to find out how the xray wall would work
leroy cocaines a hell of a drug buddy
build the wall so trumpty dumpty can have a big fall from it
fix that patchyass beard and you could be handsome as a motherfucker
hard to watch cause that guy was so dumb
support your local high tory gang
you face at the end says it all rotfflmao
wow not 37 percent that is a lie immigrants especially illegal immigrants commit less crime to not get deported duh they are often victims of crimes because the law doesnt protect them this guy is such a liar i might respect him and his views if he didnt flat out make up statistics
native americans were greatly affected by the european colonization of the americas which began in 1492 and their population declined precipitously due to introduced diseases warfare and slavery
stay away from go green global
love that xray wall laughing emoji
videogame industry is fucking up big time no more fps we need more srpg more sim games war sim games
more like cringe my mind 
im going to build a wall around my tv so i dont have to watch pseudointellectual mouth breathers the spanish guy whos not mexican but has a 500year mexican family history explain why building a border wall is an inappropriate method of potentially deterring illegal migrant crossings
a physical wall will not prevent illegal immigrants from entering your country it will only promote bad practices in mexico with human smuggling and the like instead of fighting against immigrants accept them work with them and integrate them into society properly dont stack them together in 1 place spread them evenly over spaces so that it is never obvious that there are immigrants having mexicanlatinoblack communities is the worst thing you can do for integration into society america kinda ruined any chance of getting rid of that but yeah you should not be doing that in the futurealso instead of trying fight against drugs understand why they are coming in and why they are sold there is massive problem in society if people turn to drugs in their regular life talking about real drugs not marihuana
im thinking leroy was taking some of those illegal drugs seems like he drinking coca cola if you know what i mean
how the hell did she get the idea that the wall would revoke our freedom of movement
oof this was painful to watch its so disheartening to see people bending reality in their minds to justify a broken worthless worldview
this channel is too good btw guys ive made a youtube channel and ive done 3 vids so far and id appreciate it if yall check it out and maybe like the vids and subscribe to me thank you all and have a good days guys
2nd guy is dumb
omg sorry but i cant listen to this idiot rotfflmao
at least when you go to the universitys they have lucite thoughts
thought that was the jaws theme starting there at 517
lets just like put tracking chips in everyone like thats not like intrusive or worse than a wall
this guy with camera needs an xray
the mexican dude goes im not mexican im spanish my parents were in mexico since the 1550s  yeah aka youre a mexican with a lot of clearly mexxy features
why does he only use interviews with two people who are seemingly mentally ill andor on drugs if he was able to find a mildly intellectual person that could have provided a decent argument crowder would have been owned the wall is one of the most retarded ideas ive ever heard and goes against almost all of crowders libertarian values this would have been a better video this basically the opposite of what the change my mind videos are supposed to be
no borders but tag illegals like wild animals to track their movementyeah buddy lets do that
that was painful
please blurr out her name tag also
have a citation page to hand out to the people so they can change thier minds
spain  conquered raped and slaved saved later and brought back into european culture but still had that dumb rape gene then spain goes to the americas and murders and rapes and slaves the locals there now its the uss problem to treat their babies like they will grow up into regular ole joes indianrape babies babies do grow upi keep saying refer to jewish wisdom read the part about babies and walls
that last 5 min had me rolling side note crowder the wall couldnt keep the mongolians out how do you expect it to keep out mexicans
i hope that woman stays safe whether she reports or not she shouldnt have to live like that
well done to steven for being able to listen to that guy that said he wanted to become the governor of new mexico double well done for not breaking down with laughter
damn when will the whole blame the immigrants thing end been doing it for thousands of years now good luck with all that bud personally im native american all you immigrants especially the paler ones can feel free to get the fuck out
bring back yusef changemymind
so like you can tax those people and put it back into the countryyou meanlike when theyre legally here and are taxed like everyinr else
that did is a complete and utter dumbass holy shit ive never heard someone spew completely nothingness for so long and so confidently listening to leroy talk was hurting my brain
mr xrayman the future governor of mexico is a dumbass retard whos stupid is spilling out his mouth
you should have told the future governor of new mexico there that obama built a virtual fence with scanners and the like and it failed
fuck this guy can barely speak and he wants to be the governor
todays standards is he being corrupt or just ignorant hes talking about two different standards both existing today one held by corporatists fascists and leftists nihilists sadists and haters and one held by people who want to survive and to survive by the standards of the united states anyone who would pick the former needs not be listened to but congrats crowder on normalizing and justifiying such absurd worldviews by pretending they are just another view that deserves to be heard i can see it im against you overtaking my country and culture change my mind  i am for a government acknowledging inalienable rights change my mind really stupid
doesnt want immigrants to come here legally and doesnt want to deport them but wants to tag people with electronic chips to track them  mexican guy
the wall idea is too scary and too invasive lets just chip everyone and have the state track every move they make
like wow like an xray machinewhat an assdoesnt want to stop illegal immigrants from entering  then says there should be some kind of process to get illegals citenshipya moron its called legally entering the country you dick
hi stevenwhen are you coming to northern california i would like to sit down and discuss this topic with you on camera
guy number 2 with camera leeroy im an idiot with strong opinions so when you ask me how my plan would actually work logistically i have no clue and would have to defer to needing mastermind individuals and everyone should have an electronic tag and an xray machine is needed to scan people coming over the border 
so your not ok with a border wall but chipping people and using x ray scanners isnt a violation of human rights personally i feel a border wall is the best solution to keep illegals out and still have a steady stream of legals coming in  its amazing how casually people write of the criminal act of crossing a border illegally its that way everywhere around the world in fact most countrys have stricter borders
that dude had too many tide pods
end welfare and no need for the wall
i feel like the guy just described having the same wall in question but it being super advanced in technology just to avoid agreeing with trump
wow
what the hell this dude throws freedom our american freedom out the window new mexico poor you guys
how is the wall hated so much but the great wall of china seen as art
after listening to that kid its easy to see where the term dreamer comes from
wall wont work at allchange my mind
waitcan we use the money that people pay to register for daca to fund the wall  register for daca  you fund the border wall dont register for daca  youre here illegally so you get deportedwinning
i think the wall is the only way to secure such a large area but the media has blown it out of proportion the wall is no longer a wall and more of a malicious but metaphorical blockade of the border seen to be blocking out anyone from entering or exiting of course this is the purpose and the purpose is very important to intelligent people so should in my eyes be done its almost like writers using doors to present secrecy and a hidden side of a personality this wall presents a racist society that doesnt agree with any sort of immigration which it is not and the media has once again blown the whole situation out of proportionmaybe some people are against the wall but if they are then they should be properly educated that illegal immigration may benefit the country while they are in the country but as soon as they leave then the benefit is completely lost and put into the next country they travel to causing economical disasters to the country they illegally entered
this is painful to watchhow stupid can people be
i dont think they should build a wall but they should do something like give them heavier sanctions for being an illegal immigrant
that look on stevens face at the end says it all lol
this guys has made me lose all my faith in people stupidpeople
drugza lol what a tool
building a wall is not gonna stop anything save us the billions of tax dollars and do something more productive
build the wall build the 5g towers microchip the people new world order new world order lmfao this worlds fucked
the look on stevens face at the end was priceless that dude was absolutely insanelol
omg i think i am brain dead now
the wall just got 10ft higher
you cant have a gate without a wall even the scientifical xray ones
he didnt want a wall he just wants you to microchip them all xray them and track them wherever they go  that spanish dude is scarier than trump
that second dude was such an idiot talking about let them come and we can tax them etc etc issue is not just economical issue is also with demographic changes you get enough of them and they all vote for expanding welfare parties then usa is fcuked
wowsome people are just plain stupid
wtf did i just watch
id never vote that guy too be my govener he doesnt know what the actual problems in new mexico really are
whos supposed to pay for this wall change my mind
208  already starting wars down there  im talking to much now i had a mexican tell me white americans were in for a big surprise after the elections weve seen some horrid shit happen these last 2 years  im thinking theres more
sounds like that guy 1025 wants to tag mexicans like wildlife lol
im mexican american but this new generation of immigrants have a sense of entitlement i have never seen or experienced in my life my parents raised me with a sense of humility this wasnt their home country so they kept a low profile they worked and understood their position its so weird to me when youre here illegally and youre out there making demands of any kind
steven with the information that shes provided by  i think that you probably need to blur her arms and maybe even her shirt so she would not be recognized by the people in her apartment community that may want to do her harm
whatever way you lean politically the wall simply will not work most fly in and overstay their visas  huge waste of money for something purely symbolic
the earth is flat  change my mind
these people are so fucking stupid its blowing my mind they got threw life as long as they did
statistically these groups commit a disproportionate amount of crimes  but but everybody commits crime
eyy i see that crtv ad
like a tag kinda like the jews had to have the star of david but the president is the next hitler
we need an x ray system at the border instead of the wall thats a first
its a waste of money
we need to export mentally retarded people
i like how he walked off thinking he had done a great job
you were too polite with the spanish guy he was a dumbass
xray borders so we assure that everyone crossing did not break their leg
dude your face at the end almost made me lol
this guy knows the right places to put his stand notice how he put it on a corner of the street in austin which probably has a large mexican population and only debated with uneducated people why doesnt he put it at a university like he has with some of his others even a conservative knows that most of the illegal immigrants in the us are just immigrants that came here legally and just overstayed their visa a small percentage are ones who crossed the border illegally the wall wont make a difference for the majority of illegal immigrants
everyone calm down immigration has been solved all we needed was xray borders
future governor of new mexico folks
que fucking estupido that guy was
the second dude wanted to chip the mark of the beast the  illegals  right cuz that would be so much more humane than just building a wall  geeze
mentally ill low iq guests
mexican poverty is extreme 42 of the mexican population makes less than 500 a day6 billion of the planet are below their poverty limithttpwidworldworldannincp0p100992iusfrdecnzagbwolasteukpyearlyafalse075000curvefalsecountrywe make 12x the money and our goods our 24x the cost let that sink in42 of their country couldnt buy a house worth 20k without severely going in debt for the rest of their lifewith overtime working a full 60 hr week they make roughly about 1700 annuallyyou justify that and say their goods are cheaper rightour minimum wage kid can buy about 5 burger combos from mcdonalds for 2 people with a days work the comprable mexican adult can buy 1 burger combo for 1 person for a days work you didnt realize you were rich did youwhen they come over legally typically we take their strong not their weakone advantage that mexico has is they are neighbors with the most powerful  country in the world they could easily prosper if they worked themselves rightwhen we take their strong theyre losing their reformers their pioneers their future and allowing the weak of the nation to fend for themselves amongst the wolves and vultures already in powerwho would america be without our strong founding fathers fighting the british rule too many people think out of blinded emotion instead of really analyzing the issue
second guy complete dumbass with clinton crime network education
xray border  enough said lmao
wow that guy was dumb did i hear he was running for governor he definitely speaks for his liberal constituents
jared stand up straight lol
i got to give leroy some props it takes a lot of balls to get up there and show the world how fuckin retarded he is
i disagree with building a wall because the immigrants will just find other ways to get in and the wall will just cost money however i think the way we secure the border needs to be changed and enforced more also they need to deport the whole family at once the whole problem right now is that the parents are being deported and the kids are staying here they all need to be deported
delusional an electronic border what a computer chip in everyones wrist or the  of the beastif they get denied crossing do they get tazed from a central command center do these people that dont believe in borders lock the door of there home at night do they lock there home when they leave the house or does anyone just come and go as they please
i know it kinda sound dumb but wouldnt it be cheaper to just build a fence
an xray border ok
cringe
what was he trying to formulate an xray tracking system really
i could feel my iq plumiting down just listening to this guy  geez
as soon as you determine youre talking to a complete moron you should just thank them for their time and wish them a good day and be done with it
cause the wall is so much money thats a waste of money they will come anyways
no shit whites can easily be racist all they have to do is replace it with we need a wall and border security and then ask how are they racist other people of color cant do that  minoritys arent the only immigrants theres whites too oh but nobody ever mentions that right fuck that at this point who cares its better to let the world fall then let the whites win and continue to kill everyone and rape little kids fuck u
how to make profit from or decrease illegal immigration diy life hack  1 capture immigrants and bring them to camps in truckloads2 castrate them 3 force them to do manual laboroptional 4 send em back to where they came from if you are too pussy to work them to death
hi this might make me sound like an idiot but how would a wall help us im actually curious but a little confused to be honest
well as far as the percentage of illegals committing crimes 100 crossing the border illegally is a crime rendering all illegals criminals by default
i think the wall isnt going to stop tunnels from being dug and its not rockets science to build a latter its just a waste of taxes especially when most illegal emigrants come here on planes and dont go back home sure we should have some kind of boarder patrol or something but a simple wall isnt the best answer in this day and age even though that hispanic person didnt sound that intelligent he sounded a lot smarter than trump
just make a comp video of stupid people yelling stupid things at you like build a wall with your ass thats hilarious
holy crap the stupid is painful to watch lazer gates so like uma wall of some sort
wall is stupid
xray scanner you know
so these are the people ive been hearing so much about the mighty tide pod eaters
everyone that doesnt want the wall built has no idea what theyre talking about its the same with guns
youe average low iq immigrant might pay a little tax from their minimum wage job but they will be collecting vastly more in welfare and social security payments never mind the costs associated with the ones that are criminals
hello mr crowder im a long time listener of your show and channel and a grateful supporter of mugclub i remember you doing a reaction video of sorts a few years ago on the clip of the newsroom that went viral at the time and had given a very good explanation of the clip and the speech within it if possible i thought i would ask if you may do a similar video on the great dictator speech i would very much like your take on that speech ps still love these change my mind segments thought the last guys ideas were even more invasive than a wall haha
i think you should blur that lady better just for her safety
no wall no borders man just build an xray wall border we dont need borders just xray them while they cross the border
is that spanish guy for real lmao xray border make the whole border an xray machine for fuck sake man hes not even capable of being governor of a pta let alone an entire state
bro we can barely find funding for a brick wall to be built and this dude wants a freaking xray border that covers 1954 miles bro and now you want the government to be able to track immigrants wherever they go i am speechless like governor of new mexico lord have mercy
why is she carrying a plant in a plastic bottle
this would gave been a good video had your participants been remotely knowledgeable i dunno like maybe is not a good precursor to an intelligible response
leroy needs to stop watching movies and the newsprobably should lay off the video games and start reading some books and possibly learning how the world actually works before even commenting on how things are donewhat he proposed sounded exactly like what the wall and security would be doing but he is against it because of what he heard from the newshe isnt logical enough to understand what he proposed and what is happening are the same thing but still pushes on to agree with it on his own side and disagree with the other side that is proposing the same ideamaking perfect sense
i wish you would post your data sources
magic xray scanner that tags and tracks people along the whole length of the mexican us border this guy is an idiot
i agree with most of your opinions on immigration but where did you get your statsaccording to the us department of justice african americans accounted for 525 of all homicide offenders from 1980 to 2008 with whites 453 and other 22
you know that feeling you get when you read someone like plato or aristotle and you think holy cow they thought this up thousands of years before i did and thought about it so much more thoroughly than memaybe i shouldnt pretend to know so much  leroy doesnt
hey crowder why do you only show the unintelligent arguments in your discussions its like your afraid to show people what a real debate looks like you clearly educate yourself before a showas you should but then go on to pick the most dim witted people to make a funny compilation great fun but it proves absolutely nothing at the end of the day good job muddying the waters with more false info physical walls dont keep boarders safe and they definitely dont stop drugslook at any other walled boarder in the world i bet after this is done though you feel a lot better about your micro peanut
4 minutes in damn that woman broke my heart she seem so innocent and have well intentions she even asked you how she could help get rid of bad people in her neighborhood
the only arguments i have against the wall is its too literal and simplistic it wont stop illegal immigration and its a waste of money but crowder did mention he wasnt just in favor of the wall but of tightening border security
i wish i couldve sat down those where terrible arguments
1140  this guy needs to go to school before he sits down again
i wish there was more to this segment im curious what crowder has to say about the wall i feel like it will be a waste of money because it wont be long before people find a way over under around or through it if im not mistaken i think trump said something about making it a fence because of cost issues with the wall which is even worse
can you link to sources on the data you use in these videos that would be helpful
the last guy has his head so far up his ass he can see 90s scifi movies on repeat
say it with me xrays
how much coke was homeboy on
what the usa needs is more super high iq examples like this chap  make people walk through an x ray border sounds smashing
razorfist made the best argument for the wall that ive heardhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuooblcoicls
this is the most hilarious change my mind that youve done great comedy
why the fuck cant these people get their heads around the term illegal fill out the forms pay the fee no one has a problem with that you jump the queue anywhere else and people get mad changed a country all of a sudden outs not a problem
whys he trying to so sound like enrique iglesias if is family has been in the us since 1550
i like how he contradicted himself the entire discussion
enough of them are involved in criminal activity to be a concern
im so ashamed of being a latino some day i will enter usa legally and became an american citizen so i will stop saying im an uruguayan and start saying im an american some day
so he still wants something that acts like a border but doesnt look like a wall
623 what percentage is that do you think that commit crimesif we consider that illegal immigration in and of itself is considered a crime then 100 of all illegal immigrants are criminals
this was just hard to listen to  there are some truly uninformed people in the world
most of these people sound mentally ill
my god that was terrible couldnt even listen to the guy not 1 real point or attempt at changing your mind
i could not sit there with these people and take them seriously  please tell me that there were a few that seemed capable of actual thought and reasoning rather than the ones shown  they couldnt follow anything logically
wow  what a sad idiot  goodness humanity is terrifying
a wall like the one trump suggested would cost too much thats my only argument but i do think a better border security that doesnt cost as much as the wall would be better and also enforce immigration lays
as a studying computer engineer in his senior year of college may i say that i believe his xray wall would be a lot more expensive than a regular wall with a few checkpoints xd
the second guy seemed like a nice guy thoughnot nearly as douchey as the college educated jerks  id take him over the other pretentious and nasty people this segment sometimes finds
scientifical nice maybe you shouldnt have such a strong opinion about something you know nothing about
lol the first guy says shi without really thinking it through typical dumbass
cheap prick yaaaassss
wow
this mexican master mind needs a platform such a brilliant mind
that was worth the entire watch just for the last 5 seconds nameofyoursextape
x ray border i wasnt ready for that
you know new mexico were a sanctuary city
the guy wants to tag everyone how do you accomplish that with an unsecured border
and that is whats wrong with america
blur out her badge as well
feeling for the spanish you boxed him in his own bull
the first guy has been watching to many syfy movies
holy shit contestant number onetons of ideaszero possibility of actual execution
hahaha your face at the end
how can you tax illegal immigrants if they have no documents
without immigration control immigrants who arrive illegally will avoid paying taxes given a choice most people would not pay taxes so people who are off the grid are not going to pay anything if thats suddenly made ok then you end up with a 2 tired system which is unfair on the legal immigrants and and the rest of the population if its left unchecked then eventually there will be short falls in revenue from taxes that the country needs to maintain it self no boarders would be fine if there were no society to maintain progressives miss this point or choose to ignore it
that last guy had trump derangement syndrome he opposed building the wall but he literally proposed a border checkpoint system with scanners and stuff he just didnt want to say he agreed with trump that the border needs to be secured trumo said it so its bad in his mind even if he agrees with the idea
am i the only one who thinks border security shouldnt be a political stance but more of a trivial thing
the dude seemed legit insane
stupid always have unreasonable demands and stupid ideas and talks smart comes up with real realistic solutions  so the guy who sat down has stupid ideas 
we are fucked
how can you tax the immigrants when majority of them have low income jobs that they could barely survive in this country poverty struck people literally the spanish guy is actually idiotic this guy literally knew nothing no facts means no logical  reasoning
building the wall will not help anyone it will cost billions to build and billions upon billions to maintain and to pay the guards and repairs the wall will neither stop the about 40 who come in on airplanes and just overstay their visas this will most likely strangle the economy and force people to pay for this with higher taxes and prevent people to staring new businesses which everyone knows is the backbone of the usa economy
why do you lock your homes and cars for protection your bones are borders  so why cant the country do the same
the end expression says it all
crowders look at the end priceless
build an xray border lol  hes going to win his race for governor for sure
these are honestly the best videos
i dont want a wall but perhaps some sort of xray scanning device stretched across the entire borderlike a wall of detection
how does steven not just start cracking up in these props
1550s fuck dude your mexican
corny made up laws and made up borders man yall corny
some kind of xray scanner lol what a duche
5 to 10 years i think 50 to 100 years and then i am being generous
the xray border guy is in cyberpunk 2077
you got some real geniuses on this one and everything lol this was seriously painful
you could have given leroy 30 seconds and then ditched him we get it hes real stupid
what in the actual f was thisxrays lasersno borders governor of new mexico
the second guy is a doofus  he has no idea of real life
the sjws will actually think this is a good idea  httpswwwfacebookcomtonightlyvideosvb445344025893190453697961724463type2theater

you dumb shit whites deserve mexican immigrants
man that last guy was stupid
whats up with leeroys tongue the guy is tweakin lol
anybody opposed to a wall should just head to venezuela and enjoy it the best they can and then when they want to come back they should have to reapply for citizenship because there is a wall
not leroy is a real globalist scum bag
that was actually pretty civil
yeah because an xray scan border would be cheaper than a wall and also a viable option smh i cant believe that was a serious suggestion
please get in contact with me i would love to change your mind
some people are concerned that immigrants are violent and engaged in particular types of violent crime to address this concern martinez lee and nielsen 2004 studied drug and homicide crime in miami florida and san diego california to determine if there is a relationship between violent crime and immigration although both cities have a large hispanic and immigration population martinez et al found that foreignborn persons were not responsible for the communities drug and violent crime the increase in crime was associated with secondgeneration youth who were more likely to be involved in homicides related to drug offending in both communities according to the researchers segmented assimilation among secondgeneration youth can explain criminal patterns since mexican american youth in poor neighborhoods despite cultural assimilation committed violent crimes if however immigrant families had economic stability eg jobs their offspring were not likely to engage in drugrelated homicidesmartinez stowell and lee 2010 analyzed the relationship between homicide and immigration in san diego during periods of major increases in the foreignborn population 19802000 they wanted to test the immigrant paradox the paradox is that despite social disorganization theorys prediction that people living in socially disorganized neighborhoods will have higher crime rates communities with large immigrant populations have lower levels of crime martinez et al posited that immigrants exhibit strong social controls education and mental health attributes and rejuvenate neighborhoods that had been previously considered to be highcrime innercity communities while the researchers found that socially disorganized neighborhoods experienced increases in homicides they also found that when communities had an influx of immigrants there were fewer homicides their findings suggest that while certain neighborhoods foster crime if recent immigrants settle in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods the impact on the violent crime rate can be nullifiedvlez 2009 studied homicide offenses in chicago she compared city neighborhoods that had dense populations of white hispanic and african american residents and the homicide rates within these neighborhoods and found that homicide rates are significantly higher in african american neighborhoods and are closely associated with neighborhoods with a concentrated disadvantaged population neighborhoods with concentrated disadvantage are those with a large percentage of residents with incomes below the poverty line limited employment of residents age 16 and older many female head of household families and high unemployment she found that in areas where there were large populations of recent immigrants the number of homicides decreased vlez attributed this finding to the reinvigoration of neighborhoods when new immigrants arrived she suggested that the new arrivals arguably want to strengthen ties with their neighbors increase community organizations and improve the local economysampson morenoff and raudenbush 2005 analyzed data for chicago between 1995 and 2002 to determine if ethnic and racial differences in neighborhoods account for residents engaging in violence they found that age recent immigration status and ethnicity matters when analyzing crimes of violence youth in all race and ethnic groups are more likely to engage in violence and the level of violence peaks at ages 17 or 18 in addition they found that recent immigrants engaged in less violence than their offspring thirdgeneration immigrants had higher levels of violence than secondgeneration and secondgeneration immigrants had higher levels of violence than firstgeneration immigrants when considering race and ethnicity african americans had higher levels of violence than whites and whites had higher levels of violence than mexican americans even when controlling for neighborhood composition neighborhoods matter if a neighborhood had a higher level of violence prior to changed social demographics changes in the immigrant population then the odds that persons in the neighborhood would engage in violence were significantly higher than in other neighborhoodsarrest sentencing and incarceration rates have been changing in the late the 20th and early 21st centuries since reaching an alltime high in both

im confused if black people commit 50 of the murder and illegals do 37 then 13 is all asians whites and legal mexicans doesnt add up to me but id have to look that up
why stop at borders how about we eliminate personal property oh you got a new tv cool its mine now
the xray guy is totally insane
the x ray border is stupid you would have to tag everyone coming through the mexican border in order for it to work there are some many problems with this everything the guy says is what legal us citizens do get ssi numbers and pay taxes so it sounds like to him that the only thing you need to do to become an american citizen is just walk here
tag people  he said tag illegal immigrants  im sure if he thought that through he would change his mind but funny off the top remark
these arguments of they have children have you no compassion  i have children does that make me exempt from laws 
i dont agree with the second guy but i still dont want the wall to be build
the power of the educated registered voter at workuggghhh could we slap the sense into them is it not obvious you should not have sat downwhat a circle of chaotic rantings that must live within his head
lol toying him around
where the fk did you pick these people at
ill change your mind with this comment according to the logic of the 2nd amendment to protect against a tyranical government this wall can be used to keep people in the country vs keeping people out its a slippery slope i dont want to slide down
blur the name tag you can see who it is dont want to say how cause i dont want her name out
waste of money on a wall that protects one side of 5 sides what about pacific side atlantic side canada side the sky
i know an anchor baby his parents arnt in his lifethey used him then left himsad
so your last guest wants to electronically chip everyone like we do dogsand he wants to be governor of the city of new mexicothe sad thing about all of that  democrats will vote him into office
we need a purge people gotta thin out the short bus
sorry steven but i just cant watch this im too fed up with people rejecting rational arguments if this was math or physics well according to those ppl we would be able to fly the earth would be flat and so on and so forth
can someone bring up my argument you can have people in your country that use cryptocurrency and dont get any type of welfare and if they get caught committing a crime send them to prisons that have work programs that fund themselves people are afraid of having different types of citizens but maybe its better then making people live in a shithole
if no wall gets built i say that we should lay a massive minefield along the entire southern border as well as thousands of guard towers armed with miniguns also bury seismic sensitive charges for those tunnel digging invaders
can you please try to come to shu in ct
demonstrous proof of the damage done to our current culture by prior lax immigration law indolently educated dullards who would rather give up america than their smartphone
borders will be a thing in the past in 5 yrs
he lost me at scientifical
poor kid i like the show but would prefer you find more prepared people i think it would add credibility
oh my goodness interviewee 2 he needs to consult with mastermindsdoes he mean someone with intelligence since his is underdeveloped
when i hear immigration i just dont think of spanish speaking individuals i think if anyone out of the united states some people failed to realize that when talking about immigration laws i feel we should have tighter immigration laws but building a physical wall is kinda obscured to me yes it might create create some jobs like border control construction of the wall and keeping up maintenance the wall seem to degrade any mexican try to come in the us basically sayingah ha you cant come in shortening it up a little i believe in tighter immigration laws but a physical wall nops if anyone have a question or a general statement i will respect what you write and reply back and try to get a understanding of each other
that guy was hilarious id have to get some masterminds together
i just cant watch this these people are kind of stupid some
my friends brother and works in the fields for a farmer  he is paid cash and collects welfare  edt he is not paying taxes  taxes that come from my paycheck are paying him  to many people take advantage of the system not just including illegals
even the advertisement by ben sharpio is entertaining
what kinda drug was that guy on lol
most of these people seem mentally ill andor low iq people
fuck that dude i couldnt even bare to watch this because that dude was on cocaine
build the wall with your assbitch
wow pretty garbage people ya had to deal with lmfao how bout looking at the wall like a waste of tax dollars that mexico will never pay for and based on the calmness of the canadaus border just decentivize hopping across while maintain the rights of those who legally are hre
surprised that guy didnt suggest laser beams that zapped you if you walk past the border
what planet was that dude on
the first lady had some sort of id tag around her neck might want to blur that as well as her face
its always interesting to see the differing opinions i enjoy what steven does because he may not agree with any left ideas but he is willing to sit down and listen to these people thanks for another video steven and sorry about the random people who just show you the bird when they walk by really doesnt help my opinion on the left or left ideals when the everyday person does childish things like that
not only should a border wall be built all illegals should be deported  also legal immigration should be either reduced to 0 or changed to pre 1965 rules  citizenship should go to how it was with the 1790 immigration and naturalization act  birthright citizenship should end in favor of inherited citizenship
i knew these 200 antixray tightywhiteys were worth itbwahahahahawhos the loser now mom
i just want everyone to know that not everyone from new mexico is that fuckin stupid
that guy is an idiot 
that guy was insane put a chip in everybody as one of the ideas on his board
dang over 1000 asylum seekers dislike this video
waste of a video yet i understand why it was posted  it was for the average moron on the street
this guy has his own showuh horrible
to the second person interviewedwait what
i think my brain just broke
second guy suggesting some real mark of the beast shit i wouldnt even wish that on my worst enemies
heres 5 quick facts to consider when talking about a border wall  httpwwwpewresearchorgfacttank201704275factsaboutillegalimmigrationintheusalso nearly 70 of all illegal immigrants are overstays which means they came here legally and instead of leaving when there visa was up they stayed meaning that were spending billions of dollars that should be directed towards tracking those that come on a visa on a wall that wont even have the potential to stop a majority of the illegals in this country
i live in new mexico and you guys may laughed at that comment about him running however the citizens here are politically stupid
stevens face at the end perfect
how stupid do people have to be for crowder to feel comfortable publishing a conversation with them crowder is a shameless propagandist that stat about illegals committing 37 of the homicides is fucking bullshit go look it up sheep
an xray border weve officially lapsed into sharks with laser beams attached to their heads territory
what grade level education do you think white shirt guy aka future nm governor has
fucking x rays bro
the reason no boarders work in europe is because every country in europe has a firm government body that can control their population this is very much the opposite of mexico that is riddled with violence drugs and lawlessness i could see some what how no boarders would work with canada but i could also see how it wouldnt work
oh steve admit youre flattered when people cuss you out without a discussion because it translates i have no argument
i am from new mexico that guy would make a terrible governor new mexico needs someone to save it from corruption poverty bad education drugs and illegal immigrationbuildthewall
wtf f f f f we are doomed 
ohh you americans
from his own word he is no mastermind
omg please have the second guy watch himself
when did young white people become so stupid brainwashed and selfloathinghe was interviewing hispanics but im taking about the white snowflake hecklers on the sidewalk
build the xray wallchange my mind
keep them out keep us in  please cage us all already  how do you keep prisoners inside a prison build a wall  how do you keep citizens inside a doomed country build a bigger wall  people are always talking about illeagles drugs stolen work blah blah blah my queation for everyone is what about everyone else the wall affects such as yourself  really has any one actualy sat down and thought about what it means for leagle citizens what if we need a quick escape rout for god knows what maby yellowstone blows you have two options south ie mexico or north ie canada if you ask me warm climate is better to live in the frozen think america think
so uhhreally nowwas that guy trolling 
yay change my mind
please explain why inceasing border security with the most violent country on the face of the earth is somehow racist or wrong
we are so screwed
this makes americans look so thick just like here in the uk the population has no clue what is going on
that was painful to watch
1 immigration due to border crossings has significantly decreased most illegal immigration is done now by overstaying visas planes fly over walls 2 the wall will cost too much money and as stated above will not make much of an impact 3 american property owners will lose property due to eminent domain american land has to be used to build the wall 4 america will lose most of its access to the rio grandewe can keep going
ive been in this country for almost 12 years now i came here from russia with my mother legally and my father is a american citizen ive went to school and i am not attending college to become a physical therapist im 20 years old and im still waiting to get my social security number i cant even get a job or get my drivers license but the government gives me a tax id number when i cant even pay taxes because i cant get a job immigration in this country is messed up and i think its also messed up that people that come here illegally can get their stuff a lot faster than people that do it legally i love the united states and everything about it thats just my only problem i have with the government
you need to get some people with an iq none of these people could put together a coherent thought
i loveeeeeee it when you do these
so the wall is bad but microchipping people and zapping them with xrays after theyve submitted their bordercrossing essays is totally cool
fair tax any money spent by anyone goes into the economy no income tax no capital gains no pay roll tax ect httpsfairtaxorg
omg smh o just cant take this guy i think he has been smoking too much of something new mexico governor
xrays dont stop these people from coming in we just identify when they do
lmao leroy your brothers from the border are very disappointed in you 
i really hope you helped sort those problems with the first lady out before you posted this
mr earring doesnt know what hes talking about
how did you keep a straight face when the guy said he planned to become the major of new mexico
future people  dont get high on drugs that will make you hyper and  and talk about not having the  a panel of geniuses
steven you are just too polite to these idiots
how have we never thought of a xray border give everyone tons of radioactive exposure
this is a free thought right now so for me to execute this i would have to get like a few mastermind individuals to sit down i can not tell you a bla bla blatant answer right now 
what a fucking idiot the 2nd guy was  not one actual coherent thought dumb fuck  typical leftist moron
is it me or is the guy actually arguing for just a different kind of border security
an xray scanner at the border 
wow people seem to forget the legal immigrants who are still waiting in the immigration process so just give citizenship to the illegals just wow cut in line in front of all those who worked hard and paid a lot of money to come here
it wouldve been nice to hear some genuinely wellthought arguments in favor of a more open border when weak arguments are presented i dont feel educatedchallenged by these videos it just seems like taking advantage of emotional responses from individuals who are put on the spot id like to hear the strongest possible argument of the opposition opinion its the best way to strengthen my own
wow was it dumb ass day taking polotics and other beleifs out of it none of the interviewees can form a basic argument
might need a gatekeeper of some sort to weed out the crazies
undocumented immigrants have a lower crime rate than native citizens they work many of the jobs americans dont want to work im not for people being here illegally but building a wall is the most unneffecient solution to the issue it would be extremely costly and would be yet another waste of spending that could go towards the education of our children rehabilitation of our poor or other more important issues
yo leroy lets make trump the pres of the world no borders needed lol
that guy had no damn idea what the hell he was saying he was probably high while saying it
your either and intelligent informed individual or a democratliberal
this is what people in california trying to make gun laws in sound like exactly like that dudeyeah we should ban that grip thing which makes a slower rate of fully semi automic fire and also like lets like start doing background checks before people can buy guns
so 35 of the population does 37 of the homicides and 60 of the drug trafficking anybody have the sources for these
that he described another more expensive wall
that second guy cant be serious
whatuh the fuckuh is with that second guysuh speech patterns
the salute at the end was awkward af and then stevens face at the end just about sums it up 
building the wall is just a waste of money that we can use on other things like education
x r a y   b o r d e r
so the problem with these change my mind things is that 50 of the population is below average intelligence and you seem to always get those onesbuilding a wall is a complete waste of money and will have no effect  use that money on more immigration agents judges and more effective deportation policiesor use that money to cut my fucking taxes  expand stop and search if you dont speak english you should be required to carry documentation with you at all times
haha that ending though p
drugsuh  what are drugsuhand speaking of drugsuh what the hell are you on
man thats hard to watch new challenge watch the video without shaking your head and whispering wtf is wrong with people
1317
if i was in a third world shithole and a rich welfare state was on the other side of a wall i have no doubt i could defeat that obstacle i could take a plane take a boat use a ladder a shovel a grappling hook or wrap myself in bubble wrap and catapult over where theres a will theres a way we need to remove the will
this guy is the dumbest person i have ever heard so far we dont want a wall but we can make money off criminals and undocumented people how if you dont know who they are how can you tax them also more people does not provide more money in taxeshis suggestions on scanning people who come in is also stupid even if you had he technology without the wall how do you force people to talk through the scannerthis guy is so dumb
this fckr watched to many scifi movies  hell why not im implant a rocket on my back so i can fly to the moon and back when i want
this was the best chamge my mind yet imo
drugzza mastermind planners scientifical i love this guy please interview him more
757 if you give one illegal amnesty you give the whole world amnesty because it shows were so weak as a nation that we wont stop anyone from coming here evading punishment for long enough and getting citizenship fuck that noise
boulder coneeds to happen
love change my mind
i wanna see an actual intelligent individual go up against crowder it would be interesting
what
because building the wall just waste money
if we had a wall then these kids would not be separated from their parents those that are against the wall are for pro family separation the sickos
idk anything building the wall but can government spend money on hospital or education
holy hell cocain is a hell a drug
wowwe shouldnt have a wall but we have a scanner and rfid chips fuck that
there is apparent language and culture barrier the guy is definitely not smart on the subject at all this was definitely a waste of a conversation you are definitely better then this video i understand that it isnt scripted
that last guy 
crowderso place an industrial size xray machine at the border that will give the illegals cancer so the citizens can pay for their medical expenses and bankrupt america brainless globalistyea something like that
say it with me crowder all illegal aliens have committed crimes simply by entering illegally and need to be punished accordingly
blurs out face leaves id badge around her neck visible k
my mans wants to be the hokage of new mexico 
deport dacas the only problem with the wall is that its terrible for the environment machine gun outposts would be better for our environment
i kind of agree with one of the points the first lady made  most illegals come in on a visa and then simply dont leave when it expires  the wall is probably the least costeffective measure to combat illegal immigration with the first being followups and enforcement of expired visas
but what if the guy holds a big sheet of metal over his head when he walks across the xray border  im sure the masterminds will figure that out along the way  then again how will the xray border stop the teleportation machines  or if someone goes and uses their time machine theyll be able to cross the border before we make the xray border  geez  this is so complicated  glad that well have the governor of new mexico on the case
what are crowders sources
like if you think crowder should react to superwomans newest video on homophobic people
the xray guy gave some good points but was kinda whack overall my stance on immigration is that the path to gaining legal status should be simplified in my experience the vast majority of people arent avoiding legal status to not pay taxes but rather because the path to legal status is too difficult and too expensive the concept of the wall is a bit ridiculous to me the majority of illegal immigration happens when people fly over a wall will do nothing to stop that you mention without a wall that there would be no way to identify people but checkpoints are currently in place people that circumvent those checkpoints i imagine do it because they wouldnt be allowed through them sure there are criminals that would like to avoid taxes and commit crimes but i would argue that most of them are honest people that want to make a living an easier path to legal status would negate the reason yo avoid said checkpoints and people could enter legally the concept of an average person having to constantly be on their best behavior to not get deported just so they dont have to pay taxes seems a bit ridiculous the wall would be ridiculously expensive that american citizens would have to pay for simply make that path to legal status simple and then all the undocumented immigrants can become legal and start paying taxes those that refuse to do so should be deported but i dont think that the people that are currently being deported are given an option for citizenship before being deported
522 anecdotal evidence is anecdotal and is the worst kid of evidence to make policy from
good lord what is wronge with people we shouldnt have boarders i guess i should pay a global tax now right
i would also like to note that the second guy watches too much anime
crowder is using some very incomplete statists  the numbers hes referring to at 627 are only for federal sentencing and can be found here httpswwwusscgovsitesdefaultfilespdfresearchandpublicationsannualreportsandsourcebooks2017table09pdf  this high rate is likely due to the fact that many crimes that would normally be prosecuted in state courts are referred to ice if they are committed by illegal immigrants  notice that this is a sample of for example 72 murders way lower than the thousands reported by the fbilooking at crime in texas we can look at this study by the cato institute demonstrates that illegal immigrants commit fewer crimes that native americans and legal immigrants are far lower httpswwwcatoorgpublicationsimmigrationresearchpolicybriefcriminalimmigrantstexasillegalimmigrant  there are lots of other studies that have similar finding though it is still too understudied to draw high confidence conclusions nationally  crowder should really drop the point about illegal immigrants committing more crimes since at best its unproven and at worst it untrue
wow you made your point and he still kept his dignity   that must have been so hard
we need the wall built along every square inch of the border after that deport all illegals i dont care if an illegal becomes president send him back give citizenship to all whites across the world and safe passage if they want to come just like israel does for jews we need to return to the immigration policy of early america where only white men and women of good character can come
trump said they arent giving us their best and brightest theyre sending their rapiest drug dealers and gang members sure he didnt say most of them because he insinuating that the mexicans crossing illegally are rapiest drug dealers and gang members wake up and smell the racist id hate for a seemly smart man like you end up on the wrong side of history when america fell apart and started to placing fleeing immigrants in concentration camps this crowder head thought is was more important to nit pick trumps racist nonsense than ask if hes doing the right thing
the look on your face at that last second perfectly summed up that xray border idea
for me im against the wall but for a better way of keeping and getting illegally immigrants out
liberalism is a mental disorder
i couldnt listen to that goof after the xray bit lmfaoo
2m subs for crowder he just doubled his subscribe base in less than a year that kinda growth is crazy i dont see colbert kimmel vox or any other left wing propaganda channels moving up like that great job steven
you know make them take a test to become legal and make them pay taxesso become legal citizenslol wow
lol sharks with frickin lasers on their heads in the rio grande
liberals argue that such a long wall cant be built but think monitoring the whole border with xrays is possible smh
so the main reason immigrants come to the united states is because their country is shit plain and simple the government is corrupt cops get paid off by criminals and get away with whatever they want theyre just tired of living in that type of environment so they choose to come to america for a better life that being said yes there will be criminals who want to leave as well and fuck them for ruining it for all the hard working immigrants who for most part never committed a crime in their life i believe in a secure border but not the way its being done right now like the guy said they will always find a way around it its a waste of money building such a massive structure it might help for a little while but eventually theyll find a way trust me my solution is something i really hadnt heard people talk about so let me know what yall think but what ive been thinking is basically instead of worrying so much on stopping immigrants coming all together why not help the reason why theyre coming in the first place why not help mexico with their infamous drug cartels theyre the ones bringing in the drugs and ruining both countries this is americas issue just as its mexicos not to mention the cartels are basically terrorist themselves america already helps every other country with issues like these why not help the neighbor thats causing so many issues you cant tell me the united states army or marines couldnt handle a couple of cartels we have the best army in the world dont we why not use them to help secure our borders against the real criminals that way people wont be so inclined to leave their country because guess what they love their country they dont leave because they hate it they hate the situation its in right now but they would rather much be in their home land where theyre not judged or feel attacked by others
know your enemies
i do i report those people
this show makes me realize how dumb the average american really is scary
us is a sovereign nation borders go handandhand it isnt difficult no country in the world has open borders
the gender one was better tho but i love these so much
we can build the wall with the bones of all the people socialism and open borders has killed
tried to look at this from a liberals view but was unable to turn off my brain how do they do that theyre so good at it
leroy is an idiot
should people like the second man be allowed to vote its strange i believe in democracy but he has me doubting myself
cant wait for him to run for governor then this video is shown
i dont think the people who sit down with you are capable of staying on topic this episode was kind of a disappointment in that both people interviewed had no real points of topic and really i dont think they understand what the concept of your change my mind series is about
an xray border hahahathis second dude was stupendously ignorant
funny deadpan face at the end 
crowders face at the end lol 
build a wall and there will be tunnels lol
dont use the money for the wall use the money to before and first lower immigration requirements change the immigration checks to give legal visas and allow more good hard working people even if they are very poor and have low education into the country people without any criminal records and then maybe build the wall to block the criminals to get in allow people that can work and pay taxes
oo
the second guy was not the brightest bulb
i actually had a convo with stephen at this exact table on the microphone and made some excellent points about how the majority of illegal immigrants are visa overstays not those who cross the border and stephen started mumbling and cut me off looks like they only include the unintelligent conversations rather than those in which their fellow citizens actually make valid points   shame on u crowder ur whole show is a scam
i wish we would build a wall here in england
just tax them  what about the welfare stateyou dont think every fuck will come over to exploit it like they already aremoron
do not make this guy governor of new mexico
so remove civil liberties no boarders just simple gps chip everyone  might as well put it in the back of the head with a self destruct function prevent tampering  p
does the first woman even know how popular this channel is lol someone gonna see this a rat her out why even show that part what if those people are ms13
yah most antiwall arguments are accurately reflected by the brilliant passing fuck you
do more of these i could watch these all day  this needed to be longer 
steven is very misleading with his statistics  taking what he said about 37 of murders being commited by illegal immigrants who are 35 of the population  lets do the math shall we doing some simple google searches the us population is 325106 325 million  so that would mean that 1146 114 million are illegal immigrants  alright next using the amount of homicides committed in 2016 tried to find 2017s couldnt find it though there were 17250 murders  and 37 of that is 63825 murders meaning that 63825 murders where commited by illegal immigrants  now assuming that one person is killed per murderer  114106 people  divided by 63825 murders equals 1786 people per 1 murder  meaning that 1 out of 1786 commit 1 murder  we can also divided the amount of murders by people to see the murders commited per person 63825 divided by 114106 equals 559104 559 times 10 raised to the negative 4th power murder commited per person  so we can see from this that sure if this stat is true which i dont know  we see that the vast majority of illegal immigrants are not murderers and dont let anyone try and scare you with stats that are very misleading do the math your self its not hard i literally only had to google the us population and murders commited in 2016
we should have checkpoints but no wall because that makes perfect sense that guy was on another plane of existence maybe hes a 4th dimensional being and we just dont understand his 4th dimensional logic
the second guy was so dumb hard working newmexicansthey dont exist that state doesnt have a right to work law
boy it appears there is nothing more irrational than a economic migrant from a third world country theyre like little kids trying to explain themselves at some point they will try the whitey card but american black s dont want them here either
build the wall change my mindmexican in thumbnailgotta love it
pogo pooh bear 
so you dont want to actually build a wall you just dont want illegal immigrationno one wants illegal immigration clickbaiting douchebag
no other country puts up with illegal immigration so why should our standards be lower the only reason im against building this wall is from an economic standpoint i dont feel like its an economic long term or overall reasonable solution to manage the problem sure it will create jobs temporarily but evidently the project is projected to extend into the trillions where exactly is this money supposed to come from were there a justifiable method of income to sustain such a project id likely be more for it at this juncture i feel like some sort of immigration reform laws are more a reasonable set of objectives to reach for just my 2 cents
true intellectual right there d
so the solution is to just legalize anyone and everyone that comes over america would be a hell hole within 5 years their corruption would slowly bleed into our country until we were run by the same cartel and this would happen because all the people coming over would be able to vote and they would vote in corrupt politicians until we slowly become just like the country they are trying to escape build the wall and take away incentives for those already here they will leave on their own
the us is doomed just look at brazil if you want to see your futureonce you go brown you go down
crowderi love you man and i watch your show constantlybut geez this one was just not worth posting hahaha you couldve just made a video saying that the event took place but that the conversations were a complete waste of time i dunno im probably wrong though
where do you find these people lol
build an xray wall of lasers that check the microchip implanted in your brain
scientifical xray borders put into place by masterminds
lol  wow people getting dumb by every century what he said will cost more than build a wall
he didnt seem too bright
okay i feel really bad and sad for the first woman she fair for her life that need addressed the man after her is dumb he need to realize we spend billion of taxes money on these illegal immigrants  we teach their children we pay for their medical we feed them and them it holds low wages down because they get jobs and their low wages job are the one they hold
that second guy was talking some scary bat 7 stuff
build a wall of bullets and i bet that technology will stop illegal immigration
great job steven the second guy was painfulhe is trying but there was not a complete thought that came out of his mouth
ummm  i dont know how to tell people this but the border is already fenced and it has been for decades  so what is the difference between a wall and a fence
haha that look at the end how does this kid not get the wall is so we can have boarders to check people coming in and out and their reason for coming here like me has mentioned poor keep is one of those leftist ideology brainwashed people that talk in circles about how they feel on a certain topic and is really and truly misinformed
2nd guy tax them and make them citizens somehow rofl right illegals are paid cash under the table taxing them would make them known and get them deported because logic
god new mexico is a hell hole
is that not a mexican dude actually high himself what a joke
more free flowing yeah more free flowing
according to the 2nd guy we should just let everyone and anyone in illegally and let them get citizenship no matter what country theyre from even that is just a disaster waiting to happen he didnt even take into account the impact this could have on population people who are not willing to assimilate into society or immigrants with former criminal records i seriously hope that guy never becomes the governor of new mexico he has a good heart but not very bright at the same time
illegal immigrants are 3 of the american population and commit 37 of homicides thats outrageous deport them all that is just sick
some people dont think the universe be how it isbut it do               black science man
s a l l i n g  t h e  d r u g s
man my dad came here legally and did everything right to live in this beautiful country i get offended on immigrant being here illegally cause man my dad went through hell just to be a citizen
2nd guy is ignorant and speaks poorly  if he has a talk show probably not many followers
that last guy polite but dumb as bricks
whered you get that walther shirt i need one
im a cheap prick lol
we american citizens want a border wall or get rid of welfare programs all welfare programs have to go
fuck muhammad fuck islam and any supporters you are not welcome here fuck trudeau and sharia there will never be peace on earth with islam god bless trump god bless geert god bless nigel god bless le pen god bless ezra and the rebel god bless alex and infowars god bless ben shapiro kevin johnston and sandra soloman
mastermind individuals
steven this is urgent as you may already know many mexicans have nurtured a hatred inside them towards trump mainly because democrats and all the corrupt politicians from mexico have poisoned our minds telling us that an open border is our only hope deviating all atention away from them since they are the ones damaging mexican economy and making migration the only hope of many well i heard rumors about russia seeking to enforce their relationship with mexico taking advantage of mexicos point of view towards trump and his policies to the point of bringing their bases with artillery to mexican soil this would of course create jobs and improve our economy but tension between mexico and us would increase many see this as a payback to the us for the mistreatment received by imigrants from the new government what do you think the us should do treat imigrants better amnesty what restrains mexico from making deals with russia its now weak relation with tge us do you see any posibility of war if this happens i really want to hear your opinion guys
reading comprehension is super important kids it really bleeds into other like stuff that helps you sound kinda smart or not entirely retarded
mark of the beast
walls work both ways and government controls who passes either way thats not my idea of freedom
lol uh some sort of xray border wall that was epic
i think the connection between securing the border and the jump to how would you do that without a wall is too loose of an argument to support an actual physical wall i think most reasonable americans would agree with having a secure border but we shouldnt conflate those whom intentionally avoid checkpointscustoms with those that stayed here beyond their visa the path to citizenship is an arduous one especially after 911 and we should work on improving shortening and making it more accessible to hard working immigrants that came here to pursue american successesas for an actual physical wall what is the costbenefit on that would we even get a return on our investment it doesnt seem likely at all how much would the wall as a symbol alone hurt the united states with south american relations not to mention the message it sends to any potential immigrant from that region i am not trying to put a price on an american life im trying to say that there are much more cost efficient ways to secure a border than to build a wall across 3000 kilometers
the second guy became more 1984 than anyone else
the mexican american immigrant being interviewed is ignorant and why would we not want more of them here
im honestly confused by the second guy
america is the most criminal country in the world change my mind
1056 scientifical  we as a species are well and truly fked
surprised cause i got an ad for this video and it was a clip from the 2 genders change my mind video lol
new mexicos my city
just to make sure the numbers are clear on the crime statistics homicides by illegal immegrants counts for 37 of homicedes out of 17250 counted homicides in 2016 that makes 6382 homicides by illegal immigrants if we say that each one of those are unique immigrants so 6382 immigrants killing 6382 people that makes up for 0065 of illegal immigrants will commit homicide or about 6 in 10000 you are punishing 9994 people in 10000 for 6 bad apples i think there is a better solution than just blaming all of them and i think there are other factors to look at instead of just blaming millions for the faults of thousands
2nd guy actually makes me want the wall built faster
i will like to convince him to not just build a wall but also a electric barbed wire fence also
you seem paranoid you only want a wall because the united states stole the southwest from mexico and they still feel shame and guilt about it california arizona new mexico and texas
lmaowe should have an xray borderdonald trump wants to know your locationallow                block
uuuugh really wish i could sit down and talk with you sometimes especially for this one
second guy is too
you cant have an intelligent conversation with morons they only watch cnn and flock with the communist liberals who want to destroy our american way of life
holy shit that second guy just doesnt get it he cant follow a logical thought for more than 5 seconds
lol an xray gate why not just pass that xray cause there will be no wall thats stupid
the stupidity that comes out of their mouths is staggering
when he said x ray scaner i lost it loooool
out out out
the second guy omg he has to be tripping balls
that face man summed up how i felt that entire conversation i feel for you crowder
xray scan border dont we have enough cancer already hahaha
borders in general are a thing of the pastlets make a super sophisticated border that creates an id tag and tracks wherever you go while also taxing them
you are a savagekeep up the good work
the camera intimidates people youd get the real truth  what they really think using a hidden mic or camera
germany had a wall you already cant leave the united states with all of your material resources money unfortunately walls work both ways
this guy is dumb as fuck lol new mexico is a sanctuary city apparently  i could have sworn it was a state
so the 2nd guy doesnt want a wall but wants to put electronic tags on immigrants like animals some how funnel them through an xray machine make them legal citizens and then tax them
i saw an ad wondering if you got any monetization on it
well this is why we have to talk to each other how else are we going to understand each what our neighbors fellow americans really think about this or that
build an xray bordernext
spanish james hetfield every line ends with ahhh

diamond stud wants a borderless society then goes on to describe an electronic border  i wouldnt let him run a mcdonalds
i want to see adam from adam ruins everything and steve debate
that due aint spanishhes ashamed to be mexican
build the wall and get these illegals out why do we continue to put foreigners first before our own people how is it fair for an undocumented immigrant to get a scholarship over me sorry i have no sympathy liberals are worried about children being separated from their families but american children have been separated from their fathers due to our corrupt government get these racist illegals out tired of them sucking up all of our funds that our meant for us
dude i hate the new change my mind location
i appreciate the courage of the lady and leroy to sit down with them in a border state  i just wish someone would have sit down with crowder who was more educated on the issues
this is cringe worthy this younger generation is so miss guided its beyond pathetic wow he wants to run for gov in new mexico some day lmao the scary thing is i think he could win smh
it must have been slim pickings to give this moron so much camera time

that second dude is so high go green global lol
i can help this guy out with his xray wall  not a wall  he could have rainbows that people would have to walk under to be xrayed  of course unicorns would be guarding the xray wall to make sure everyone enters under the rainbow
your parents have been here since the 1500s and you cant even speak fucking english xray border wtf
i wonder if that woman wants to report the people she owes
the second guy really doesnt understand  it hurt me to watch him
build the xray build the xray build the xray
the guy who claimed to be spanish doesnt look or sound like a spaniardbut he does look and sound like a mexican mestizohe said his ancestors have been in new mexico since about 1550funnynew mexico wasnt even founded until 1912i thought he was high at first but then realized that hes just ignorant and has no clue as to what hes even trying to sayfor someone whose family has supposedly been in north america for the past 468 years he has a piss poor command of the english language im calling bull shit on this vato
just the usual uninformed clueless foolishness from the leftists
this guys too uneducated to be a governor
stevens stare at the the end 
im mexican and have been deported and i agree with trump about deportation just an fyi for all of you out there mexico has done deportations also on a bigger scale this is nothing new you cannot blame trump for following the law of their country
you get caught climbing over the wall we shoot you you die if you try to break out of prison in the usa they shoot you die whats the problem 
altlite look over there that person is pushing feminism antiwhite rhetoric transgenderism on children sjwism and islamme that person is a jew shows proofaltlite omg youre a nazi evil antisemite bigot people like you need to be eradicated racist piece of shit right wing sjw
the second guy has been watching so much movies that it is no longer healthy for him xray borders
thatwas painful to watch
you didnt hide the first lady that well you should blur her completely and dont show any distinctive features
im sorry i know this is off topicand probably a dumb question but im just curious is there a difference between crtv and mugclub if so where do i sign up so that i can be a member of the mug club and get the mug thank you keep up the good work mrcrowder god bless
makes me embarrassed to be a native new mexican  that dude is definitely at the topa his gamea
illegal aliens are not by definition immigrants immigrants come here through the lawful process of immigration and become citizens
im a mexican please build the wall enforce security both goverments should cooperate on that and reduce drug traffic from mxico to usa and reduce gun traffic from usa to mxico
im not gay change my mind
this is why you dont snort a gram of coke and then do an interview after
i thought it was weird when people put that flavored powder in their bottled water but this woman has a whole plant in hers
just saying is steve was to jump up and rip his shirt off and bull rush while yelling what the fk you say to anyone who said fk your wall and trump while walking by they would lay down and just cry all pussys
the left needs to build a wall around this dolts mouth lol
that spanish guy was all cringe
wow dumb
screw the wallwhat we need to do is completely close our borders and call back every american to this land for at least 10 yearsthen we could slowly open the border for properly vetted individuals
at the 1140 mark i have no idea how crowder refrained from busting out laughing lol
this is very entertaining but id like to see steven debate a real progressive democrat on this even at their dnc two years ago dws couldnt lay out why open borders is a defendable policy
hopefully steven does an episode in philadelphia as someone from here the people are very ignorant but we have a lot of people who would love to sit down and chat over stuff like this
this guys brain needs to be xrayed
personally im against the wall because it seems like a waste of money and effort i dont believe that its going to be effective enough for determined immigrants the only upside i see is the money americans can make from building the wall
xray boarder problem solved
i dont see how any intelligent person could be ok with wasting billions of dollars on a wall we dont need and that wont work i thought republicans were against the wasting of taxpayer money this is ridiculous
i took a dump in my hand
how long you all in austin
2nd guys idea reminded me of the toll booth from blazing saddles
that wettie with the white shirt has no idea what he is saying cannot put bis insane ideas into coherent words nor can he speak in proper sentences that dude is making every person of color look bad
go green global just saw this and got pissed this idiot endorsed them lol
can go under or around a wall right is the wall going to extend to hawaii 
every member of the nwo ejaculated around the 1300 mark
1316 hahaha thats how i felt after watching
wow i am from nm and i assure you that we do not all sound like this but at least he sat down and had some ideas more than most of the democrats
im not from america so i dont really care but dont most illegal imigrants come by plane
the wall is a symbol of trumps policy of immigration a very expensive one that trump said mexico will pay for but in the meantime trump want congress to front before that happens
leroys manifesto1 capture slavahem citizens2 force lai mean tax them for work3 xrays everywhere leroy for governor 2018
lol xray border you mean a checkpoint
i hear the argument of capitulation to reality  build a 50ft wall and theyll make a 51 ft ladder build a wall and theyll make a tunnel under it nationstates are a 20th century outdated idea screw that
what percentage of illegal aliens commit crime 100 hence the term illegal aliens every last person who entered this country illegally or overstayed their lawful permission to be here are criminals by definitionfurther if in coming to my country your very first act is to break the law to enter this does not bode well for the chances you will be lawabiding thereafter
we need this wall wheres humpty dumpty gonna sit
high in public lol
man the second guy was so stupid i couldnt even finish watching the video
seriously people if you dont support the border take your front door off its hinges stop being hypocritesalso the xray fence idea could work sterilize them when they cross the border without permission brilliant
lol that seconed dude wants to be governer lol i guess hes about a stupid as the rest of them
seriously people if you dont support the border take your front door off its hinges stop being hypocrites
that 2nd guy was so close to suggesting filling the waters with sharks with laser beams attached to their heads
as a mexican that lives in mxico im ok with the wall i understand why the usa wants to build it but we are not going to pay for that
second dude seemed like an actual tard
is the second person a rapper
crowder do you always debate with any random idiot
crowder has to be cherry picking these clips theres no way that every person he talks to is retarded theres nothing more annoying then a stupid confident person
you want millions of people into a country that still has millions of its own people unemployedwhy cant these people just understand how the rules of the universe works i dont want to kill myself but  change my mind
im with him xray wall is the solution
build the xray gate
the x ray border is scientifical
well honestly the future governor of new mexico knows how to have a respectful conversation
build the wall  what dont they understand  illegal means illegal  really stupid arguments against the wall
i think mexico would split nicely in to 3 or 4 new states
you need to have some kind of weeding out before the interviews  interviewing random looney tunes is hard to watch
wellokat least he thought about it even if he doesnt realize with his xray tagged border crossers he is quite in fact supporting borders and honestly promoting something way more sinister and 1984esque than a concrete wall he thought about it all good judgement comes from bad experience all good ideas evolve from something even bad or mediocre ideas he is a prime candidate for learning the truth merely because he was willing to engage in dialogue with an opposite not really viewpoint with announcing his channel name he is likely going to get several watchers from this show to go give him a bit of education i just hope its kind and teacherly rather than mean and petty like so many of the comments here red pill that guy dont run him down like a lynch mob
stevens face at the end killed me 
im getting dumber watching this
your face at the end says it all my friend
we do need border security but im not sure a 216 billion dollar wall is going to magically stop all or even most drugs and people from being smuggled into the country the wall will just be climbed over and tunneled under we all know the cartel loves to tunnel not to mention how it could negatively impact the migration patterns of wildlife or how the wall would need to go through privately owned land it just doesnt seem practical or worth while
im scared for her you shouldve blurred her all out and her voice too
the future governer of new mexico folks
xray borders electronic chips what this guy needs to lay off the pot
i came here legallynot that difficult the residence sure its a bit more difficult but once you have those you should be alright
my god leon needs to put down the meth pipe and read a fucking book that shit was painful to watch and even more painful to hear computer id chips and fucking spytech xray borders wtf
your oncampus change my minds induce much more openminded people and much more interesting discussions
can you do a provaxantivax video you seem like you rely on a lot of data and scientific evidence but im pretty sure the scientist who suggested vaccinations cause autism was either charged with scientific fraud or used poor methodology i think its the latter the result hasnt been widely replicated and doesnt align with current developmental neuropsych theories of autism  so im interested to see where you stand on this one
xray border why build a wall when we can implant all mexicans with cybernetic identification that will be read when any of them happen to cross from mexico into the us so they can pay their taxes neck snaps from rapid head shaking
that guy was basically arguing them becoming legal citizens which is what we all want them to do legally
make george orwells fiction agean
f your wall
the amount of drugs going into the usa is a smaller  compared to the amount of drugs grown and made inside the states also the amount of drugs that is making it into the state is a small  using the ground boarders the large shipments come in by ship and plane as for the wall if your going to build one along the usa mexican boarder you better build one on the canadian boarder too cause we dont want you shipping all those drugs up too us
kinda like disney land second dude
is he describing dystopia
im against the wall because i think its a waste of money 
lmao hes thinking of running for governor of new mexico sadly hed probably win
its not me that says this its statistics proceeds to use made up numbers
whats worse having a border wall or electronically tagging every person who crosses so the government knows where youre at at all times holy shit
this show should be called you cant change my mind not to mention the inaccuracy in some of the statistics used by this clown also its clear to see how he obviously only shows the most erratic and stupid interviewees to make himself look better and get all his fan boys and girls riled up
i am a man change my mind
wall debate will shift when there is a state meltdown crisis in mexico or south america  or a southern border terror incident
theyre not sending their best  the same could be said for the people who talked to crowder in this segment
did that guy just propose tagging the immigrants
if that dude becomes a governor we are fucking doomed
whenever my faith in humanity begins to recover i somehow manage to run into another change my mind fuck me
i plan on someday being the governor of new mexico hahahahaha lmao this dude has brain damage
well someone watched a lot of scifi
that guy is planning on being governor of new mexico suuuure
im not against building the wall but i think it will be relatively ineffective
cheees i am now just gonna dislike or like your stupid conversation videos judging by the title 
x ray wall  
should bedo you have a brainchange my mind
i am not trying to make fun of the second guy but omfg the way he pronounces shit and  his ideas  like no borders like tax themlike no wall 
if only mexico would police its southern boarder which obama gave them millions for  the mexican government is happy to let its citizens cross the boarder because those illegals send money back into mexico
80 of the women who cross the border illegally from south america get raped
hey steven ive actually agreed with u on most of the change my mind segments but this one i kinda dont agree with if you would like to set up an interview with me and i have some good points about why i disagree i would love to come on and talk with you about it
its going to be hard to find people to speak with an opposition to your change my mind i believe most americans support the wall and will not speak out for fear of being labeled a racist bigot xenophobe etcpeople would rather express themselves privately in a manner such as voting just like the election there is i believe a silent majority too scared to say what they think on the topic because the harassment from the liberals and the msm so you wont find but a few argue against the wall and border security unless you went to a college in california just looking for the sad angry tolerant liberals
ill have what this second guy was having lmao
statistically the word statistically will be used way more when talking about statistics
call the masterminds  we need that xray border
that ending lmao
i can stop all illegal immigrants in one dayconsider the lowly wood chipperthis is the scenario set up wood chipper say a morbark 5048 whole tree drum chipperat a known crossing point invite the pressexpress your intent broadcast it live and  wait  the press will be insane by this point the whole world will be tuning in to see if the ice agents will really go thru with it finally some unlucky illegals arrivea live chase and ice captures the illegals the terror is palpable they are rounded up and put into a prepared fenced chute all that is left is to feed the first dozen random illegal crossers men women childrenbabys and the coyotes that guide them into the hopper at gunpoint a conveyor belt begins to turn and the illegals move toward the grinder the press is incensed tv ratings and live streams hit record numbers the screams are heartbreaking the first falls into the rotating blades and is jettisoned as a fine mist of flesh and bone one after the other they fall and are blown out the exit as stew the press is screaming one reporter is puking her guts out onto her manolo blahnik shoes the cameras are shaking and pointing at random things to stem the horror a man with an impeccable suit and dead eyes walks out of a government car and up to one of the cameras he says  the government of the usa has decided to take a hard line against crime there will be no more illegal immigration that goes for those that are already here you have 48 hours to vacate the country we will not be taking questions at this timeit will take over a week to prove that its was a hoax but by then the problem will have been solved and for a lot of the world they will never ever believe it was a hoaxproblem solved change my mind
borders a thing of the past in 5 to 10 years no just no it would require the entire world to cooperate with that its just not gonna happen any time soon
i highly doubt illegals account for 37 of homicides in this country
i lost some brain cells on this one that second guy was especially clueless his ideas were so over the top not only would that be a logistical nightmare the left will not go for it and it would not have a good  to effect  ratio
lmao that border hopping spic look like he smells like shit
omg i live near new mexico lord help us if that 2nd guy becomes governor
the main questions i want to be answer are 1 can you define overpopulation and how do you determine when a country is overpopulated 2 with the current resource capacity how many more people do you believe america can take in without being overpopulated 3 when you get to the point where over population is close how do you suggest a country goes about ensuring it doesnt become overpopulated if people really think about these questions they will see that they have no fucking idea of how any of this works yet despite how ignorant everyone has a strong opinion on this issue dumb ass human beings
jesus i can see the smoke coming out of this guys ears thinking about the scientifical details of a nonwall checkpoint
building the wall will cost a tremendous amount of money  not just to build  but to maintain both with personnel as well as physical maintenance of the surveillance systems and wall itself we can spend that money much more efficiently in enforcement and penalize mexico or other nations financially for not controlling their side of the border more diligently we spend about 50 billion annual in aid to mexico  cut off the money and lets see how quickly mexico controls their border mexico is today what columbia was in the 80s  a defacto narcoterrorist state until mexico brings their country into the 21st century and takes down the cartels  mexico will always be a place where people want to leave
the spanish guy is fucking retarded 80iq at most xr a y    b o r d e r   lol
lol hes so syfy
masterminduh xrayuh scientificaluh written explainationuh muh drug waruh opiatesuh boss hoggsuh
that second dude  again being attacked for presenting new ideas 
i didnt realize isis had developed a stupidbomb and their first target had been austin
so a border wall is a step too far but microchipping everyone so big brother can tell where you are at any given time isnt and thats not a violation of privacy but clear backpacks arei must be odd i literally cannot even
yo you blurred her face and left her picture of her face on her id card maybe wanna fix that
i dont know like you know
help the economy so why dont they help mexicos economy this dude is an adhd dolt
lol that spaniard sounds like a mexican 
this guy is proposing a pretty interesting idea for a story lolborder patrol 2029
ofc there need to be immigration laws and deportation but building the wall is absolutely useless  you know it crowder just poking the bear for views
lots o love from the logical left if that exists otherwise i guess im a neorightest just came up with the term   logic trumps emotional response build the wall great grand parents came from mexico legally
did i just get called a cheap prick
it is false that immigrants commit the most crime google it would it make sense that native born make up the highest percentage and commit the least crime statistically no
im going to call bs on crowders claim that undocumented immigrants 35 of the population commit 37 of the the murders the other guy seems to recognize that too when he looked confusedskeptical and asked 13 what is your source because i have seen nothing suggesting such an exaggerated figure for example cis reports that noncitizens not just undocumented immigrants commits 89 percent of homicides even fox news only reported about 12 with this dubious disclaimer in the absence of comprehensive data foxnewscom examined a patchwork of local state and federal statistics cato poked a lot of holes in that article so even 12 is probably erroneously high
im sorry is he saying xray scanner
white people smh my head
that man is on the cocaine
pretty sure hes handicappeda
2nd guy has been watching too many marvel comic movies we can make like an invisible gate around the border that magically gives you a number and asks wtf is you doin here and then somehow taxes you i dunno man me and my homies gotta fix all the details but im gonna be governor of new mexico
the first guy is why kids shouldnt do drugs 
i love how we finds very low iq people to argue against his position
was that guy high  or just stupid
gaming disorderchange my mind
these people are not us america is our home our nation we do not want to be a part of mexico and this flood of shitty people from the 3rd world is an invasion and supports the rise of racial bolshevism its all going to end in a race war and we white men are getting ready to fight and win in the post collapse america see you soon
worst change my mind ever change my mind
lol the guy 952 says we need to chip all illegals to track them in order to tax them hahaha
the spanish guy damn that was a whole new level of stupid
rfid for everyone oh that doesnt scream opression who is this second guy he doesnt know anything his ideas are super opressive
airplanes the wall cant stop them done
the look on that second guys face while you were telling him the scary numbers was a level of priceless that im failing to find the words to describe 637 sweet sithis in the void hes not even capable of expressing coherent thought
does anyone have any idea where steven got his stats about illegal immigrants committing 37 of the murders in this country that cannot be close to correct
the second guy talking is what i imagine most people actually believe they believe in border security but cant say a wall because thats mean
alot of the time i find you pretty annoying with you always being so right but i respect how you are always respectful and have good debates
so his entire idea to fix the border crisis is dont build the wall instead chip people and force them to pass through a check point and liberals wonder why people think they are stupid
i was really hoping you would have found some people with some intelligence on the subject and issue at hand i love a good verbal sparing but these people almost didnt have a rational thought in their brain hard to watch
this is successfully proving how uneducated and uninformed and how dangerous some of the viewpoints you hear are
this guys ideas are worst than a wall im for the wall by the way
i will not get an rfid this dude is talking about thre process already in place he is too dumb to be the governor of new mexico
correct me if im wrong but dont all countries or territories have boarders of some kind you know for safety and shit whether or not this sounds presumptuous but we still get terrorist attacks in our country shouldnt we have safety make it known we are guarded this is aside from immigration i mean yes make them all legal citizens
so get rid of the border and then check people at the bordergood job second guy
the second guys ideas are so offensive and invasive im surprised hes ok with all that but not a wall
so the last guy had no solution at all and was unable to put together a coherent thought
1315 when you realize theres no hope for the left
holy shiti got a change my mind ad for crtv on a change my mind videoyoutube get your shit together
new mexico is fucked
im totally for a reform but the wall would make so many financial issues most immigrants over stay their visas anyway thats the main issue
after watching this the wall doesnt seem like such a bad idea
build a tiny wall and put marines on it with 50 cal snipers anyone not headed to the gate gets their head blown off job done
borders are a thing of the past okay buddy then you wanting people to come into the country will be a thing of the past fucking ignorant globalist
the look at the end is priceless once again steven awesome job keep these coming
foreign immigration is a literal trojan horse
if only the natives built a wall against europeans
dude is straight illiterate  scientoligical  lmao
my disagreement with the wall is on how it should be built i think we should build it with the blood and bones of the children we abduct and the wall of bones will be a deterent to all who dare cross it problem solved the republican way death and slaves are the republican ways
xray rfid tags so we inject rfids into everyone and we have to document as to why we are at whatever place reallyminority report
that guy at about 500 is a really bad liar hes mexican af and anyone with either eyes or ears can tell
people believing the us doesnt need a boarder wall should not have locks on their cars and homes why  well those locks are creating a boarder and they should live what they preach
that radiaton belt instead of wall was actually great idea
dont ladders shovels and pickaxes exist in mexico im not denying that illegal immigration is a problem but i hardly think a wall is gonna make a difference considering how much it will cost
that second guy is nuts   his idea sounds like what china is doing
lmao  this is a three year old idea the second guy
what must be noted is the fact that a lot of the legal immigrants do not want more illegal immigration  one reason is that these ms13 guys come into their communities  imagine it being that you left the country because of all the violent drug crime and your liberal friends invite the exact same people who you ran from to come over  and they put them in your community not their own  if nancy pelosi had to live right next to the ms13 members whom she is brining in she would change her tune real quick
second guy says he wants to be governor of new mexico sum day you know he proweed to the max
goddamn ive heard some stupid ass people in my day but this new mexico dude is straight fucking retardedmight as well ask for ear tags like fucking cattle and open borders with no checkpoints
crazy guy i dont know the proper scientifical ray that is used 1056 me ray charlesduhstupid
i was really looking forward to this one but it was a big disappointment its an easy topic to discuss but no one can talk about it
we are the wall
theres some strong shit in that womens bottle
but if illegal immigrants earn below tax revenue on average and consume more public resources how can you tax them their tax burden will always be higher than their input
the us wasnt a thing in the 1550s lol
having a discussion about this topic with someone and curious as to where i can find the statistics he cited in this video thanks
bad episode but can u do another one
its impossible to change stevens mind because his whole persona is to be this right wing trope
that guy in the white shirt is a total fucking idiot we should deport him
we should take the illegal immigrants and make them build barracks for more immigrants until they can be processed and legally become citizens that way they get jobs working on the barracks and when they obtain citizenship they can enter the country legally then we arent separating families and can help people find a better future legally
sorry ill admit im a cheap prick right now thanks for the content
what a frightening orwellian future this dude wants with id tags and x ray machines scanning the public jesus christ take china and cross it with modern socialist venezuela with a dash of north korea
shouting and swearing is unproductive idk why its always girls that do it if your so angry why dont you put all that aggression into a debate
hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiip crowder ily bro
the second guy has good intentionsbut lets face ithes insane
low iq liars everywhere the wall is definitely needed for any country usa has been too lax against these illegals because corrupted democrats want their votes in the future if they become citizens somehowremember that obama said far worse things about illegals back in early 2000s just because he was the pretty face of politics in some eyes and was speaking much better than trump it doesnt mean he was all saint and pure hearted no matter which party you support you all need to watch their actions and punish them with your votes this time its democrats turn to be punished they allowed this to happen they allowed mega corporates to take advantage of cheap labor of illegals and damaged the middle class
watched an add for change my mind while waiting to watch  change my mind  effective marketing
build the wall stop the illegal invaders  if you dont want the wall we could use bullets and not have any more problems with invaders
imagine what america would be like if these 3rd world 80 iq people were the majority and were in power holy shit something needs to be done
man watching these videos i always sway to steven his so intelligent and breaks it down simply for i to understand and brings facts to the table and addresses one issue at a time to not confuse the narrative or audience i thought the wall was stupid but he just asks what else should we do to prevent illegal people coming in and i have nothing maybe not a wall but we gotta do something
muslims are to europe as mexicans are to america
need further proof a wall would work china has a wall and they have almost no mexicans
leroy wants to implement the mark of the beast wow
so that last fool wants to do away with borders but enforce mandatory tracking devices baaaaaahahahaha
you should do the same topic just in a different spot
you should do the same topic just in a different spot
no way should we put a wall we should put chips in them then tax them but before that we should pump are them with xrays people are really brainwashed its better to say we should radiate them including the children instead of just putting a wall up makes sense to me
snoop dog at 015
why is this so much shorter than your other change my mind videos it only features the most ineloquent and least informed people you could find so you end up only having to rebut a few ridiculous arguments against the wall without setting forth any real argument as to why its a good idea i cant help but feel you dont have very many logical reasons to justify why we should pay to have this wall built im not impressed crowder i expected more from you
this is so entertaining i wish it was longer that second dude was such an idiot
these people have literally no clue what they are talking about  emotional feelings only no arguments
i disagree with you on many issues but i absolutely love this series its incredible how people are baffled by a sound argument with level emotion keep it up crowder
yo yall gotta blur that id card too 
u need a new location for this question
jeeez that second guy is really ignorant and just out right dumb he is just repeating a few talking points he has been probably heard from his equally ignorant dumb friends and the media this is the typical gullible fool that the radical left brainwashes with their fake news and propaganda
the spainish guys heart is in the right place but he is not seeing the whole picture
if the wall isnt going to stop people from coming over then why are you against  build the wall and let them come over
the more the second guy talked the closer and closer his idea got to how our border checkpoints are already set up electronic stamp telling when you arrived  passport a written declaration  have that
you see im against the wall because it would simply cost too much and would take too long but i do believe in fair and secure imigration
hmm soo he doesnt want borders but asks for an xray border bruh if we cant deport and find all illegals how in the world is an xray border going to solve this  oh man
that spanish dude is retarded
unfortunately the quality of the conversation relies on the quality of the guests
the second guy is ridiculously stupid jesus christ i couldnt listen to him
what surprised me most was how many people are so utterly ignorant about this topic the second gentleman wants to be in politics i think he needs an education first word of advice to the second gentleman having a youtube channel doesnt give you the intelligence necessary to speak on these topics without the benefit of first educating yourself about the issues
and sir what is your solution to the illegal immigration problem xray wall
if yall really want to make them stop coming then first think why why is it that they are running away from their home why the fuck would someone want to leave their home with nothing just the clothes they are wearing on their backs is all they have now why would they be willing to stuggle that way vacation visiting no fucking neither like the first woman said there are wars raging in mexico with the people the police who in their right minds would be able to rais a child there now when it comes to the safety of your own family memebers or just your child rules and laws are the least of their concerns when they all live in threatening situations their country is not helping them so their lieving you got a problem with that that how bout you try and fix a country where they dont give a shit about your problems or just making it worse because nobody will stay in a place like that violence running the streets running their homes and all they can do is run away plus thers already a fucking wall a wall that has been improved but not the homes for the people who are still planing on running away
i felt awful for the first woman you spoke with she seemed really scared heartbreaking the second guy seemed like he just drank a gallon of coffee scientificalxray borders what was like listening to a beat poet lol thanks for doing this specific topic enforce the border build the wall
i couldnt watch the second guy
the walltm wouldnt stop airplanes
so an xray border where we need to round up every single person in the world and tag them like a puppy dog in case they decide to wander over our high tech border will be more cost effective and embraced by everyone ohkaaaaaayyyyy that was wild will there be a part 2 with some coherent arguments against the wall
what kills me is all the hillary supporters who are against border security and the wall they evidently didnt take a look at her stance on the topic during her first time running as potus
crowder fuming ready to blow
for a good stretch it almost seemed like the guy was saying that what we need to do to solve illegal immigration is to make people go through the naturalization process umm  yeah
what the hell is this guy on about so youre proposing a gigantic how many mile long xray machine thats going to scan anybody and everybody that walks across what are you smoking kid no borders means you dont know who the hell is here how they got here when they got here when they left nothing and they can do whatever they want whenever they want and just flee how do you not see a problem with that
i like the talking point for this cmm it seems like both people wanted a stronger border without wanting to admit it to themselves the advised counter points were pretty much just have illegal immigrants immigrate legally which is what the wall is about the wall seems scary but why shouldnt a country have a secure border
i fear that people are going to start catching on to crowder the more popular he gets and wont want to participate why was this only 13 minutes long
how have people become so fucking thick  lol
scientifical xray walls manhe essentially wants to microchip illegals lol
all of these people live in the matrix non reality  latinos will stand with there kind no matter what  they all hate us americans and our country  boot camp them up and enslave all latinas tho build our beautiful wall
the really terrifying thing about that second guy is that hes probably closer to the truth of what will actually end up happening than most people realize as the surveillance state increases and the authoritarian governments of the world seek ever increasingly efficient accurate and reliable ways to track and monitor individuals combined with the advances of technology a chip with payment identification cell phone capabilities and gps tracking is hardly unthinkable within the next generation
you support any form of border controlnohow will we know who enters the country xray borders
the second guys ideas were crazy scary stevens like i want a wall and popper channel for immigrants to enter and that guys like we should tag them always know where they are identify them somehow holly crap thats way worse then just having them use the proper channels
the second guy is literally from the future
last comment total gold as i am the cheap prick i am from australia and i am one who just loves a good laugh at how naive some people can be especially in your own country dont get me wrong i love the usa if i ever win tatts i am buying a big ass ranch in colorado or wyoming and becoming a citizen i have dreamed dreamt about it for years just cant  afford it anyway enough about me why dont they get it
this video was very boring the second guy totally ruined the whole video no interest in finishing it
what world is this idiot living in we can already travel super fast and super cheap
seriously this is the biggest idiot yet on these series
blurred her face but not her id badge
second guy is kinda out there if you know what i mean
her face is visible at 108
this guy would rather everyone whether they are citizens immigrants illegal aliens be tracked electronically by the government than have a international border 
just tax them and make them legal citizens to benefit the economy etc  thats why a wall is needed you wont be able to tax american citizens if the are not known to exist in america in the first place why would mexicans pay and try to become a legal citizen when they can go into america illegally and avoid tax anyway
the way the second guy talks is so annoying
that guy was stoned i guarantee you thanks steven for wasting my time
so the 2nd guy all i got out of it was dont build a wall and violate everyones privacy with rfid chips and xrays and yet create a funnel an checkpoint the wall is sounding even greater now
this is the worst change my mind
best ending
1317 hes like what the fck was that
all the normies are freaking out over the second guy when its pretty clear hes an obvious troll and just got all you damn boomers man lmao
i would have been a pretty good guest for this i think because i am 100 with steven on pretty all his points except im not sold on the wall i see it as an expensive statement more than a pragmatic solution
there is an article out that made the front page of reddit that says that trump is indisputably the worst president in history
why was this so short surely someone besides these to people sat down
hell yeah xray gates xray border ftw
sure build the wall but illegal immigrants should not be separated from their kids ie sent back to their native country while their kid is left in america
the second dude is so cringy i had to turn the video off
x ray scanners are the solution guys 
id like to make it to your next setup any idea when that will be
jesus steven has a lot of patience p
its funny how conservative people act and think like children building a wall thinking that it will stop illegal immigration is just like thinking that your grandpa carabine would defend you from a tyrannical government
1226 quoting president trump i see
the way the second guy speaks shows hes trying to make justifications based on his current his knowledge which is completely uneducated he literally has no clue oh just tax thembruh what
and the xray border will get them heheheh hes not that crazy but he is saying it poorly
the future gov
ever heard of a ladder
the face at the end lol 
the mastermind individuals decided a wall would be the best solution
my sources tell me the second individual disguised as a human arrived earlier that day on a space craft from the sombrero galaxy
okay if there is a wall that is built along our border it is funded through tax dollars forcing tax payers to pay for that is theft as any federally mandated tax is you released a change my mind video titled socialism is evil i agree with that videos premise and this wall fits perfectly in the category of socialism i am in support of some process or background check to prevent those who could pose a threat from entering our country not those smuggling drugs or weapons the government should not regulate consumption of goods for example immigrants from islamic origins who have potential to carry out terrorist action would be denied entrance to our country but a wall is not necessary to that out and thus it is a commodity being forcibly taxed for a commodity as previously stated by you in your socialism is evil video is evil
dude is not spanish lol
that second guy has to be the biggest moron on the internet right now lol
razorfist made the most compelling case for why we need the wall because hes actually been to mexico not tourist mexico where all these huwyte people go on vacation and think is great mexico mexico
he wants and xray wall not a physical wall oh and microchip tracking lol thats way more extreme then trumps plan
the second  guy is high as a mofo
only the dumb ones were willing to debate this one  the others know that they have no argument
i cant wait for the xray wall
the second guy was pure science fiction cudos to steven for even siting thru that conversation sheesh
this guy is a perfect example of a person who thinks hes an intellectual yet who actually have no idea what they are talking about
i was born in this great country but my parents  werent born here they came when they were around 17 and they now have papers how can i debate someone when all they keep telling me well your parents came here illegallywhat is a good come back
this is the kind of topic that geographical location definately has a play in if you speak to someone closer to the border such as in austin texas hell no are they going to want to open borders to for people to come commit violence where they live thats why its easy for someone in the hollywood hills whos guarded by gates and armed guards to make decisions on behalf of other people
that guy is just soooo dumb
i would like to know stevens sources when he quotes that undocumented immigrants disproportionately commit crimes i agree with many of crowders arguments in many of these videos but i disagree with many of his arguments as well ive always wanted to know his sources
how is a border wall worse than chipping and live tracking people  wtf
i live in austin let me know if you ever need an extra hand at any of your excursions
she has a plant sticking out of her bottle
hispanics take out far more than they put into the tax system just tax them bro isnt a good reason to keep the illegals at least while the welfare state is intact
jesus fucking christ even disregarding immigration the wall trump has suggested would be a complete financial and environmental disaster change my mind on that
we should have auto turrets bzrrrrrp bvrrrrp click click  duhduhduhduhduduhduhduhdudhduhdudduhduhduhduh target destroyed bvrrrp bvewwww
my grandfather and grandmother on my moms side were born and raised in central mexico  they came over legally and acquired citizenship and learned english and assimilated fine i had 0 problems vising my mothers family in central mexico and coming back last september  that womans paranoid  i dont blame her though  all the left wing media talk so much nonsense it warps people and makes them paranoid over lies and their propaganda
id and tag everyone sounds like a nazi to me
that guys definitely gonna be the governor oh yeah
im a cheap prick crowder               change my mind
dude shouldnt have smoked up before setting down to the table
damn steven i thought you were smarter than this
i like how the second guys idea was a contradiction as well as a shiteam version of what we already have plus xrays lol
i usually like your stuff steven but the wall will do nothing its pointless and a waste of money
who are these people theres plenty of reasons why a wall wont work most mexicans just overstay there visa as opposed of walking through the desert while drug smugglers mostly sneak drugs through major ports i really question if this unedited
get em legal citizens and just tax em yeah like the process we already have in place maybe fuckin mook
i want border security without securing the border  i want everyone to obey all laws without enforcing any lawsyeah because that would work
build the wall with your ass bitch intensifies
hahaha mexican leroy sounded dumb af
in a cenk voice of couuuuuuuurse this video isnt trending
heres my take on the wall it seems to me that as a symbol a border wall in america would be way more successful at keeping people in than keeping people out americans are already the most poorly traveled people on the planet having a physical manifestation of xenophobia which is what a wall on the border would become would ultimately make americans even less likely to travel basically  my concern for the wall is it would become a control mechanism for the people on the inside
most of these people seem mentally ill
i think the second guy was on drugs
the second guy is just rambling about nothing
that second guy is so fucking dumb usually all the people that are against securing the border dont know what the hell they are talking about and live in fantasy land
build a mine field
the second dude talks like its year 3099
he should be the next governor of mexico
you cant tax welfare recipients moron
his face at the end had me dying hahahahah
i feel empathy for the woman she wants a better and peaceful solution which may never be achieved but the guy that sat after was such a moron hey lets tag people like cattle or endangered wild life to monitor them 247 man does this guy knows how scifi nazi that sounds america just build the wall already it worked for china all those centuries agoon another note not if but when they start to remake all of tom hanks movies i will start a riot if they dont cast crowder to take his roles seriously the first time i clicked on of your cmm videos i was like wait since when does tom hanks has a youtube channel
lets solve a borders and get rid of themwe will replace them with borders
why cant we just become a white version of wakanda why because force fields
the guy whos family lived in mexico for 500 years but not mexican the fuck was he talking about
this dude is describing a schwarzenegger movie
lol  this guys scientificle analysis on immigrication and politicology is blowing my mind   theywalkamongus clueless
0506  im not mexican  im spanish    this chump is not only ignorant hes stoopid  wow he is dang mind numbing tarded
i think person 2 was high on something  either that or bipolar  clinical diagnosis is unclear at this time and i cant see his pupils very well  just has that pressured speech and flight of ideas typical of bipolar disorder
1007   for me to execute this i would have to like a few mastermind individuals to really sit down and think this over
dude bro is surpassing joe rogan level of future thinking in the next 5 to 10 years hahahahahaha
being mexican im ashamed of the lack of knowledge my culture has we really are proving everything they say about us right
if we get the wall people dont make it into the country illegally and children arent separated from their families because they never get to that point in addition to that it reduces fatalities in the desert of people trying to make the journey and illegally by all accounts i say both sides get what they want
100 of illegal immigrants commit crimes  starting with their presence here
the second mexican guy is the male version of santa cruz ladyhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvu5ovzbwywpg
follow the rules and get punishedhmm makes sense to noonewtf
someone should rank the most idiotic change my mind guests 
im latinomy parents came here legally and so did my wifes entire family and we support the wall
i can tell you right now that dude is not from spain he is definitely indigenous
wtf is the second guyidiot
we need an xray scanner    freaking genius
used to think you were a statist leaning libertarian but youre not youre just another trumpboi im out
steven crowder you should remove the part with the lady at the start it is far to easy to track her down if something like this were to go viral she is easily recognizable and you didnt blur her id card on her chest remove it and just have asection talking about the incedent
every sovereign nation has a wall to protect its citizens
i think that guy was definitely an illegal immigrant lol ive known people exactly like this guy they spread their crazy ideas and try to pass them as innovative ideas but it ends up sounding retarded and its pretty obvious they know nothing about the context of which they are speaking not to mention xrays and chip implants are in no way shape or form even close to a good idea that is actually an inhumane thing to do to immigrants a wall wouldnt sound like such a bad idea after that
hes gonna get his masterminds to come up with a scientifical way to scan illegal immigrant id chips    god help the people who regularly watch his show
i love it most the people out there that he talks to are probably antigun but they know so little about guns they dont even notice hes wearing the gun manufacturers tshirt while hes talking to them
i think building a wall is against all western principles we should be better than thatnevertheless great content as always i love this kind of interview approach
to the second guy at no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul
that second guy had a lot of 1984
man im all for the xray shit sign me up wow fuckin brilliant my man how are people that dumb
that 2nd person was really into putting the mark of the beast on people  good intentions can lead to terrible consequences
708   anybody today nowadays creates crimes ya know         way to waste your video on a retarded person crowder    then again he does represent the sickness  that the wall needs to keep out
mr xray border is a tard
the wall has become a need  this wouldnt be an issue if we shot on sight any trespassers like the foreign invaders that they are  my sympathy only extends over legal ways of entry  if you avoid it you either want free handouts to be exempt from accountibility or to exploit via neffarious purposes  lets go to war with mexico and liberate the people there how bout that  does mexico have any military or just a corrupt police force
build the deathstar change my mind
his name is leroyand he pulled a jenkins
im not sure if its strictly necessary but do you think you should blur the first ladys name tag
build a wall with your ass she wants us to moon mexicans lol
second guy was off the wall
dudes goin off on science fiction tangent but might be on to somthing considering trump just anounced real life star wars
my biggest beef against the wall is that its already built in all of the places where there is high illegal immigrationmost people dont cross the border to become illegal immigrants  they overstay visas or cross through border checkpoints in a vehicle  they also have tunnels under the wall where it exists in places like tijuanathus building the rest of the wall through the desert is a waste of resources  the best way to fix illegal immigration is to end the drug warthe drug war is the cause of most civil unrest in mexico and centralsouth america  this pressures people to leave
i support securing the border but i dont think building the wall is a good idea while i think a wall will deter most gang members drug runners and violent criminals it will only be a matter of time until we get a democrat in office who will tear the wall down rendering it a huge waste of moneyinstead we should focus on destroying the incentives illegals have for crossing cut off federal funding for sanctuary cities hammer down on local businesses who hire illegalscasteration for sexual predators bring back the chain gangs and rock quarries and make the illegal migrant criminals work their asses off before we deport them
scientifical
2 million subs
hahaha dammnnnnnn i wouldve loved to talk to this dude im in favor of legal immigration but against  building the wall because its ineffective i did a 2 year research on immigration and subtopic of this nature
stevencrowder you mention in the beginning of your videos that you sit down with people who sometimes change your mind can you point me to a video where that happens i havent found one yet but i would really like to see a conversation that was able to influence you enough
ok so we just need to have electronic id tags tracking everyones movement throughout their entire lives neat
only idiots have a problem with immigration laws and borders they dont ever have the answers to fixing the problem
no welfare or free school and extra tax for the companys that hire them dude has a point
that guy has an extra chromosome if you ask me
wouldnt it be cheaper quicker and more efficient to just nuke mexico tho
i dont know what the proper scientifical ray thats used is but like an xray
does the second guy not comprehend how ridiculous what hes saying is god help new mexico if he becomes governorinitially he just suggested a system where people pass through a system to get citizenship so we know they are here and they are being taxed properly as citizenswe have that the wall is to stop the millions who dont want to do thathe clearly didnt process the disproportionate crime statisticsobviously open borders would not work how can anyone think thatevery country including mexico has immigration laws and rules and sentences for illegal immigration why is it only a problem when the us does it and its not about mexicans its about illegal immigrants we as the us just happen to border mexico and thats where most of our illegal immigration comes fromif you want to have a conversation about the immigration processes how long it takes the conditions of the holding areas as were seeing currently thats fine but how can you not support a wall you can still come in legallymany mexicans are hard working people and i sympathize with many especially those with children who want a better life here but we have to have rules just like every other countryyes i believe changes need to be made in the holding areas right now children shouldnt be in these conditions because they are innocent we also have to remember that mexico and their government are shit and need to get their country together so massive amounts of people arent trying to leave also you know what you are getting into if you bring your child and break the law you are walking them right into a holding cell again that being said its not the childrens fault and they dont deserve poor conditions 1314 loli realize im preaching to the choir in this comment section but i had to vent
this is so stupid
why dont we just have a fence uh durrr durr
did the second guy actually  say i one day plan on being the governor of new mexico  1139
that last dude was fucking retarded his masterminds are probably some 20 somethings in a weed circle no no se mamo
bruh that has his own show thats spanish but whose family has lived in mexico since the 1500sillegals get welfare but send any cash they get back  to mexico they are doing almost nothing for the american economyand why do you sound like a televangelist every time you say the word drugsdrugsuh
oh my holy god that second guy
family has been here since the 1550schooses to speak with an accent
500    wow what a retard
who else thinks the people sitting down on this change my mind are the most brain dead of the series  the guy spent 3 yrs thinking about immigration and he still couldnt think of a viable solution  how low iq can a person get
this is the only vid i disagree on building a wall wont do jack shit most illegals are asians that come in with visas and expire
how many of you who want the wall have actually been within 100 miles of the borderask the minute men what we should do you wont hear build a wall
i think i could change your mind why waste so much money on a wall when we have so much technology that could do the same thing without such a high cost  drones surveillance all of these could notify teams on call to take care of it
well at least the second guy was humble enough to realize that he needed to understand modern technology more
im pro trump change my mind
hi  my family has been in america 225 years longer than america has and i still have an accent
lord im ashamed of these idiots not all mexican americans are this stupid also that guy is not spanish
can you do a im pro trump change my mind
this guy talking about an xray border first of all you can not scan someone by xraying them if you were to do something like this you would have to inject an rfid tag into their skin second this is called the mark of the devil revelation 131618 also it causes all both small and great both rich and poor both free and slave to be marked on the right hand or the forehead so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark that is the name of the beast or the number of its name this calls for wisdom let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is 666
steven i dont know how you do it i couldnt stay as patient with the stupidity as you do good job brother
fucking dude wanted to tag ppl like cattle  and he wanna be governor 
never argue with a moron  those watching may not be able to tell the difference
but who are the ones selling the drugs
this video was probably only 13 minutes as opposed to 50 minutes because he had people making valid points and had to cut them out
mexican guy is living in 2058
this is a free thought right now well you get what you pay for
id love to see a video about the camps as leftists are totally against them meaning they basically want the innocent children to go to prison with their criminal parents
the second guy has absolutely no idea what he is talking about remove borders but still have borders
got a steven crowder ad on a steven crowder video 
my ad was the most recent two genders change my mind
build a wall with my ass lmao
god help the people of new mexico and their geotracking xray border wall situation
wow
damnthat guy sounds like tom arnolds latin love child
i wonder if these people who dont want the wall have ever heard of a country called australia they dont take any shit
the second guy is a good case of why marijuana should remain illegal
i mean the second guy tried
he got you with this drug argument  cartels are now second problem vs fentanyl am i wrong
scary to think that people as stupid as that spanish guy actually have the right to vote
so this is from a sepperate conversation but i think we can certainly have an interesting conversation regarding this so i am an immigrant under the standard process it took 14 yrs to become a citizen but you know what we did it was hard a lot of paperwork and reconfirmation of info etcbut we showed our worththis thing about the kids them poor kids here is the deal the illegal parents are at fault they never set up a way to legalize themselves to become contributing to society under valid means the democrats that where in office built this bill they  are the ones splitting the families oh and the lack of responsibility from the parent to do things the right way so why is illegal immigration wrong well other than it building a sub class of people it creates a new category of demeaning these people are desperate to the point of doing anything and being subjected to abuse because of their status who do you think make up the largest portion of child trafficking the ones you can manipulate easily because of their status and because they need moneyfurther more they pose an economic weight as money is funneled out mind you the value we give money here in the states is different outside the country after all it is exchanged when it if funneled out of the country as a result those that receive it drain resources from the country no not ours but their own you see the work is done here the value of work is money which recirculates in the states in exchange for goods when this money is exchanged for other monetary value outside the states does the money help produce work and function in their economy no think about it this way if the country doesnt produce work or pay sufficiently then what you are creating is a community that leaches but doesnt give back to the country as a result its a dysfunctional economy that becomes more impoverished this in turn promotes the cartel since they provide jobs fro the impoverished and as such become the law these people dont see that they see the hardships and desperation produced from the funneling and in turn only promote the state of decay in those countries by escaping and halting the growth from where they come from we do not have a system to help them maybe educating and sending them back might work but there is nothing to go back to since the comfort of the states is far more pleasing i feel for these people but they dont see the mistakes to promote the growth of a country people willing to make it grow must be there to create the opportunity to innovate and grow this is my 2 cents its not racism and its not a lack of humanitarianism this is the combination of poor judgement and poor policy making and though its tearing families what is the better option struggle or some degree of comfort many of us grew up in a state of comfort with water electricity food medicine all available at the tip of your fingers can you say with total honesty that though the conditions are harsh for these kids that the outcome is not better than they would be with their parentsas to a solution we cant repeat daca as the result has been disastrous what we need is a clear cut method to establish green cards in a safe methodical way as to provide work while influencing local expenditure and provide incentive to return to where they came to help there this is hard but if the usa is to help and avoid getting deeper into the ethics behind the immigration problem we need to influence growth where they derive from
that second dude was so unintelligent its insane how these idiots are able to survive
go to any college that has students who want to block people from class based on their race and have a segregation is bad change my mind
build it then forced to claim asylum at port of entry children separation problem solved
i understand what you meen wityh that people should immigrate legally and i agree but there isnt much legal immigartion in the first place with only 500000 a year a which equals a sixth of one precent plus america is a country of immigrants and i bet that almost everyone or all of your ancestors were once immigrant coming to this country in hopes of getting a better life for thier family
did anyone els get an ad that was one of crowders videos
this is one massive facepalm
i commend you steven for maintaining composure when that spanish guy came in with his ideas without laughing or doing any form of double takes free thinking is great and im glad hes proposing ideas instead of just whining but good lord the incoherent babbling had me gasping for air better be careful posting these guys because vox may accuse you of planting him there to make them look bad
i know it would defeat the whole man on the street vibe but jeebus maybe some screening this guy thinks that technology will make borders history in 510 years you know the scifi future cant really have a productive conversation with people who think like that
if this idiot became governor of new mexico he would be so funny because hes a real idiot and a dumbass he has no idea what the fuck hes talking about all he does is talk out of his ass and has no clue about anything
i got it every country around the world will embed a chip into everyones neck that tells everything about them so when they go to another country the new country will know where they came from and maybe even what theyve done there and if they have done something seriously illegal the chip has an explosive device so we can blow their friggin head off lol
tax the shit out of em however unfortunately they work off the books and we cant but if they get caught tax the shit out em
the wall is a dumb idea for 2 reasons 1  about 40 illegal immigrants come to the usa by plane 2   the usa already has a insane amount of debt the wall would raise taxes and cost way to much money for it to be worth it for my first point if you have never heard of that before let me explain what happens a huge percent of illegal immigrants get a tourist visa or any visa that allows them to enter legally when it expires they just stay in the country the numbers are alittle sketchy but its somewhere between 40 and 50 percent could be even higher but 40  50 is the best and safest bet it makes no sense to make the american people pay for a wall that wont stop illegal immigration all it will do is force illegal immigrants to arrive on a visa and just let it expire yes it will erase the issue of border jumping but wont stop illegal immigration in the slightest ok probably a little but not a huge amount at all
fuck these brainless retards  build that motherfucking wall
honestly xray wall  what the fuck  what about a laser wall whatever goes through gets cut  their fault for trying to enter illegally 
the wall is a waste people can get over it and it would cost money that the us currently lacks because we are very in debt
if americansreally want to slow down illegal immigration all we have to do is have 100million adults here each donate just once to the following fund there will bejobs in mexico and far fewer people will need to try to comehere it wont stop the drug dealers but the good peoplewill be able to stay home with their friends andfamily httpsdonateworldvisionorggiftcatalogeconomicempowerment
did that guy just suggest implanting micro chips for real yeah no thank you thats way too orwellian for me i guess im just old school but not happening with me
dude gives nm such a bad rep gary johnson 20 whats allepo  omg
what is the proper scientifical name for an xray scannergate    any masterminds out there know
there was only one of the most confused persons i have ever heard      this is the only change my mind ive seen you do that was disappointing
scientifical xray thing
remittances the earnings that mexican workers in the us send home quietly replaced oil revenues as mexicos number one source of foreign income last yearand with the annual remittance only steadily increasing remittances to mexico hit record 27 billion in 2016the mexican peso is only steadily and rapidly decreasingcausing more problems for even more mexicans to escape from and causing the american economy to continue to suffer from inflation more illegals more unskilled or untaxed under the table labor demand and with that demand has also came a higher minimum wage demand for the floodedunskilled labor marketin a 1790 house debate on naturalization james madison opined it is no doubt very desirable that we should hold out as many inducements as possible for the worthy part of mankind to come and settle amongst us and throw their fortunes into a common lot with ours but why is this desirableno not because diversity is our greatest value no not because big business needed cheap labor and no madison asserted not merely to swell the catalogue of people no sir it is to increase the wealth and strength of the community and those who acquire the rights of citizenship without adding to the strength or wealth of the community are not the people we are in want of
an xray border what a genius how did nobody else ever think of it     lul
im leaving this country you know the america of the past was built on great people intellectuals scientists leaders one by one getting assassinated unintellectuals just using guns the great america we used to know is gone but the american dream lives on therefore america and the freedom can be here
that last stare from steven was truly brilliant
stevencrowder were these really the best debates you could find for this topic really i mean the task isnt easy but this seems pretty underwhelming compared to the other episodes
the spanish guy is a fuckin moron borders will be a thing of the past in 510 years
the core issue is not about paying taxes the core issue is about entitlements i would agree with the young man in the white about no need for international borders if there were no government handouts to be had  which are begotten through confiscation by the government of its citizens personal property the income tax must be abolished and along with it government dole but as long as americans vote for socialism whether by electing the communist socialist democrat party or the lesssocialistbutstillsocialist republican party there will be income tax and redistribution of wealth and with it waves of immigrants looking to the us government for subsistence and therefore a wall becomes a necessary expediency in other words i could argue against the wall if my first demand was met abolish the income taxlook at it this way pigeons will flock to the man sitting in the park throwing popcorn take away the popcorn and the pigeons will not flock to him its as simple as that
i read the comments on second dude i 100 agree omfg
what percentage of illegal immigrants commit crimes100 steven
did leroy just suggest that the us do to illegal immigrants or was it all immigrants what the nazis did to the jews to keep track of them but with modern tech
how dumb they are  exray door you have to go through not connected to a wall
that kid is freaking lost good job government controlled public schools you created a complete moron incapable of stringing together a complete thought
1019 i think the second person is proposing that we have a tsa for people who want to cross the boarder
the walls a waste of money wont stop illegal immigration itll also be an eyesore and will be contradictory to the american spirit
this guy is an idiot lets put trackers on all illegals lol no sense xray wall lmfao
if that guy wants to be the governor of new mexico he needs to change his thought process he was kind of all over the place and he needs to think about current technology that we have now a straight up xray wall would cost billions of dollars to build also i agree that illegals should be taxed but i disagree that we should open our borders theres no way to accurately count all the immigrants coming in with no borders or officials
i do agree we need reform but not sure if a wall is the best way to go super expensive as well as you build a 10 foot wall all your gonna do is make a market for 11 foot ladders or shovels
the wall is for scared little snowflakes if illegal immigration is a problem go after the rich assholes that use their labor to save money
why are people so bumb also fuck you is not a compelling argument and just makes you loose
that mexican lady is going to be killed for snitching rip poor lady
an xray boarder did he really say that
wall will not change anything if there is a will or a profit they will find away tunneling under it flying over it or even boating around it shit probably just pay off some patrollers to just let them in just wasted money yes we need border control but to waste money on a wall is just stupid create more jobs and reinforce the border with man power or dedicate a satellite with thermal imaging to watch a broader area to spot tunnel exits either way illegal immigrants are going to find a way in all we can do is just keep finding them and sending them back there is no cure this is just a political ploy to say hey vote for me i can fix this oh sorry i tried but thanks for the term or terms as president or congressmen or whatever
no way this is real
xray scanners chipping everyone with identification things that will cost billions of dollars to implement but wait how will the xray identify the unidentifiable  they would first have to be caught and chipped in order for this scan to even begin to make any sense  leftism geesh
that face in the end though so real
ive said too much 
i lost brain cells ill never recover 
no wallbut 1984 is finejesus christ the left will be the death of us all
ksshsk weve got a free thought coming stay alert over kshskhttpsyoutubeuhdim73fzn0t10m3s
bless that first lady
a wall isnt the solution to illegal immigration hasnt trump seen bugs bunny cartoons tunnels catapultshot air balloons howabout the berlin wall trump is an 80s guy he should know betterscannable animal tags on their ears  good one
i think a physical wall is expensive and maaaybe not entirely neccesary but i completely stand for stricter and better border control
do space force change my mind
scientifical
nm governor  what an idiot
rip new 
i lost brain cells watching the guests on this one
they say that illegals have the jobs that americans wont do well why dont those granted amnesty prior to now have those jobs filled already
if you remove every emotional argument from these debates the liberals are only left with the argument of i dont like trunp so the wall is bad reeeeee
i dont know  like like like get em 2 dp this  that like u know complete idiot
santa fe nm is the worst i would know i live there its just a bunch of brain dead liberal hippy zombies with their heads buried so far up their asses that they literally walk in front of and get flattened by the commuter train that goes through there on a regular basis  it was so bad that they had to station city workers at the sidwalks of all of the train crossings to physically stop poeple from walking in front of the moving trains one time i came out to the parking lot to find a guy talking on his cell phone leaning up against my drivers side door i stood there for 5 minutes staring at him and asking him to move and he seriously didnt see me there nobody looks before they back up so you have to be really careful of the drivers there theres a car accident in front of my house at least once a week  hardly anynone talked to you there steven because they dont know how to debate or have meanigful conversations id say that maybe its something in the water but i seemed to have turned out just fine so i dont know what it is
some sort of electronic id tag fancy
no to the wall it will be used against us americans and for the drugs it is the usa government who is bring this stuff in not illegal immigrants dont believe the government its built on lies it is not for you its against you
build the wall if it does more bad than good  take it down  the idea is to halt illegal immigration and control illegal substance into america  if people are flooding into another country from violence or famine or pestilence try fixing the problem dont take the problem to another country you havent acheived anything but share your burden mexico needs to stop worshipping santa muerte the goddess of death  get with god
why peeps so stupid why they still live why natural selection failing
i had that exact same look on my face as soon as he said no boarders an xray
2 million subscribers congratulations you guys so happy louder with crowder is doing well despite everything against them keep it up and thank you guys for doing what you do god bless 
does the wall between mexico and guatamala make her cry
that guy doesnt represent new mexico dont judge us
applaude you for dealing with leroys total incompetence politely
now even crowder is calling them undocumented immigrants
what is that thing the second guy has with him
409 hey leroywhatyour mama shes calling you man
wouldnt the wall give us a huge debt
there is a wall in s mexico to keep out the guatemalans so why is america building a wall such a big deal they are doing a double standard
scientifical
950 did this guy really suggest tag and release with electronic chips to be able to locate them  green peace threw a fit when people started doing that to track whale migration patterns 
1317 stevens faceepic
crowders face at the end was me the whole time the second guy was talking
the luciferian new world order pieces of shit are loving idiot 2
wow screaming and acting like a child isnt a good way to change someones mind how interesting
her face is still somewhat visible on her nametag you guys need to blur her out more
pretty sure the first criteria for citizenship should be entering the country legally
suggestion you should have this change my mind at a border town i think it would be interesting maybe youll get approached by off duty customs or border patrol agents that can give their opinion and stuff as well as the people in the community that will be affected by the construction of the wall
make them residents without voting rights and watch support shrink because importing socialist votes is all that matters
xray bordersmh lol
all ready to build walljust waiting for mexico to pay for itha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha keep waiting cretins
i have yet to hear one valid argument against the wall  do these people get mad at neighbors for having a fence
ummmso lowjack everyone with some type of computer chip and expose people to frequent doses of xrays  this sounds like a great idea sarcasm
that dude was stupid
the second guy i thought was going to  talk about x ray cat and the baboon eyes dripping sauce and the beavers beaver was yelling at other beaver i hope you get the reference lol
1000 typical left proposing an end result without a process
that poor guy actually has a worse answer xray id etc lol
the mexicans should stand up to their own government and so should their fellow illegals in the us i would be embarrassed
your face at the end 
this has a lot of potential just need to get some less ignorant people
i honestly love that first lady she had her opinion discussed it peacefully and respectfully and even asked how she can change some things i have so much respect for her
blur her id badge
that guy nonsensical rambling moron
the 2nd guy is an open borders eu advocate look at europe dumbassthats working out soooooo well
so an xray border wall
build a wall wtf
at first i thought to myself that dude smokes a lot of weed as he kept talking i said nope he definitely smokes a lot of crystal meth dude has no idea what hes talking about but i give him props he went out there and he gave his opinion instead of shouting profanity like people around were
im not trying to make central south and north america  people look bad but you could make the wall and we would still jump over it go under it bring it down but the real solution would be make mexico follow the rules cause have you seen the south border of mexico people just walk like that so the wall is stupid but the us making mexico obey would be more practical imo
razorfist has a excellent video about this subject
this guy very well might be the governor of new mexico in a few years
1017 that moment in the argument he realizes he supports a wall
rather than a full on wall i think itd be more cost effective to set up a series of watch towers with cameras along the border the drawback would be the number of personnel needed to observe and react quickly to any illegal crossings as well as infrastructure maintenance
a few mastermind individuals to help him and tell him what to think they call those democrats and libtards   and side note ffs i hope to god that guy never makes it close to office in new mexico
man like where are the masterminds that will come up with how to like chip micro people and stuff like that sir
you really cant fix stupid scientifical
an anus is an exit hole not an entry one change my mind
i think that second guy has a legitimate mental disorder and should be screened
the spanish dude is special bless his heart
love the change my mind series the meme was really good
that lady was so unintelligent  i always hate having to talk to people like that  its boring and you have to make stupid chit chat she probably works for the government or the state
we could have a force field border with special id tags to get through  jesus
this guy is a total idiot he wants to be governor
i love how the first woman didnt like the wall its self but needed help to find a way to get rid of illegals i think shes a thoughsmart chick since she asked crowder for help i understand a lot of people dont like the idea idiots lol but even if they dont like it there are people like her that want to fix illegals
holy shit second guy is amazing
build that xray o
im genuinely scared for america now 
ive been thinking about being the governor of new mexicobetter laminate that desk dont want the drool peeling the finish offlike theyre begging for him to take the position but hes got big things going on 
lmfao theres no difference between a electrical border or a wall asshole
i never knew they had male valley girls from mexico
what the last guy wanted was a lot more scary than a wall
sharks with freaking xray beams
person 1 makes no sense person 2 so robbing banks should be ok so long as you pay taxes on the money you steal 
the guy in the white tshirt was a lunatic lol
we got some real dumbass people out there damn
this was pretty weak too bad about the dry spell on the sit downs  maybe get adam kokesh on your show to share his side on this issue  love your show crowder
the worst type of mexicans are the ones who think they are spanish and not mexican 
ole buddy said he wants to be governor one day hes got my vote es
is this seriously what the left has become a bunch of babeling baffoons  with no logical thought process
the dude in the white shirt gave me cancer
that 2nd guy was deffo on meth
second dude i dont want a boarder but i want people to go through a gate not a boarder but a gate free flowingeverything he had suggested is whats already in place for immigration minus the chip
geezus that second dude is not a very bright individual
that second guys inflections made this video unbearableuh 
x rayhmmmmmm
the wall will just drain tax dollars from other programs that need them tunnels under the border already exist drug runners use airplanes boats and subs want to discourage illegal immigration from mexico stop the insane war on drugs legalize and watch the power and money slip out of the cartels hands and some semblance of sanity and law return to mexico
i can safely say the hispanic dude was the most ignorant man ive ever had the displeasure to listen to
not a big fan of these people are just to stupid to actually talk its embarrassing
the 2nd guy was off his chops
second kid is a dipshit
514 i thought that was the jaws theme edited in there for some reason but then it was just a motorcycle lol
did he just describe george orwells 1984
the savage crowder returns
soooo kinda like a boarder lol he disagrees with a boarder but wants a boarder
leroy gave me a pounding headache and i blame you steven wth i blame the topic honestly there are simply not many valid arguments against building the wall outside of emotional when presented with facts about the wall from the cost to the united states for illegal immigrants to crime statistics etc the person sitting across from you has no leg left to stand on and they know it at the end of this conversation with friends their last gasp is usually yeah well trump is an asshole to which i say  okay but what does that have to do with protecting our borders cue crickets 
the wall is a waste of fucking money i can understand people being for stricter immigration policy citing laws and regulations blah blah blah thats a real argument one i dont agree with but it has its understandable aspects but the wall is a terrible idea
im impressed the spanish dude used a dukes of hazard boss hogg reference
dam that dude is coked tf out
that dude had me laughing so hard lol
violence works back at home and theyll do the same herescared people that live in fear are easier to controlthe second guy is a fool  and a liaras soon as they cross the border illegally they have commited a crime and if you cant acknowledge that then we have nothing to talk aboutnotice none of them want americans to freely travel to their countrieslet us go into your countries and well take over your countries all the waywell go to your countries and well vote in your elections and collect welfare too and well protest your government for being mean tooboo hoo hoo bitches ill see you all on the battlefield when you start the civil warill be the one not taking any prisonersno quarter and no mercy except sending you to the other side without delayim not talking about the other side of the border either
i think just like how people in jail have improvised against all odds people will do the same with the wall the wall or fence or anything there isnt the problem in my opinion the whole system needs some change  what i would do is just like the daca program give them a temporary stay with probation fingerprinting photos everything to make sure they are straight as a nail if it doesnt send them back or put them in prison have check ins where they have to prove they have a tax paying legal job and have no illegal activity there just has to be a better way
1010 say youre sitting with one
how are you wearing a long sleeve shirt in austin texas in june you mad man
one word tunnels
i used to be a major lefty and thought that conservatives were just racist for their views on immigration now i realize i was ill informed and naive i try to wake up my liberal friends but its so hard theyre blinded with cognitive dissonance
i just love how these people live in a dream world and im sorry stephen this was the worst change your mind ive ever seen my life
cocaine is a hell of a drug
that lady hahaha how do i deport them poor women
building a multibillion dollar wall is less effective than 145m worth or surveillance drones and infrared cameras there did i change your mind
its funny how people who dont wanna control the border is all philosophy and those who do is because of experience
holy crap that second person is a total idiot
hmm an xray wall how many hundreds of miles  and isnt that still a wall just in adifferent form and a few more billion to produce lol
whats funny is that i bet there would still be people who would vote for the second guy here in santa fe lol just curious where was this change my mind held
are you wearing boxers in public
yay immigration change my mind
crowder youre missing an opportunity why waste money on a medieval solution that didnt work even then take a moon shot assemble a team of scientists to create a new paradigm for a border
 that guy o m g he basically wants to secure the border wow
steven or anyone that follows the data please inform people here of the study that 35 of the population illegal immigrants commit 37 of homicides 6070 of drug related crime and 13 of violent crimethis would demolish a lot of arguments where people falsely claim that illegal immigrants commit less crime
do god is real change my mind
build the fucking walland build it high
filthy xray people playing raps and shooting all the jobs
the solution to the illegal immigration problem  xrays what a chump
the second dude is odd
so many retarded fuckers
jesus fucking christ  illegals pay about 20 billion in taxes yearly  they fucking cost 135 billion yearly you fucking moronic dunce
ya screw having a homogeneous culture where crime is relativity rare lets let in shitloads of unpredictable people who have proven to commit crime at higher rates and just microchip everyone instead great plan dumbass
build an invisible wall people will complain why they cant pass and then you say wtf youre saying you can pass fixes illegal immigration and people against the wall build
hi stevenfirstly despite me disagreeing with most of what you say i really respect and like what you do i must say the wall really wont have the impact you think it will 42 of mexican immigrants fly here on planes rather than crossing the border the wall will also cost lots of money to build and maintain that taxpayers will have to pay now and for years to come the building of the wall will also increase the number of mexicans settling in the united states because the current mexicans who plan on working in the us for a while and then returning to mexico are forced to stay in the us because they wont be able to return
i agree fuck the wall mine fields work better
2nd participant actual potential ethics violation
the second guy was living in 2048  he buggin lmao
guy in the white t shirt is oblivious how do we tax these folks when they are on public assistance will never pay taxes if there are no jobs then there are no taxes
that dude must be high
fuck a wall i want an huge xray machine that reads dna
that guy is a moron hed make a great politician
making america great again
that second guy in the white t shirt had no fucking clue and was just rambling shit
build the wall
i saw a crtv add with crowder in the crowder video lol
everyone is now dumberhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlqcu36pkh7c
build the wallmexicans for trump
no borders seriously the people of whatever country wouldnt have any sense of control or security how disrespectful would that be to the people who are legal immigrants who have go through so many obstacles to get legal citizenship what a silly comment
im not even 30 seconds i and i already disagree with you you wont hear from me in the comments but you will read from me
why dont any of these illegal who are fleeing war torn counties stay and fight we did it over 150 years ago and now we are free
708 hispanic guy says anybody today now creates crimes really wtf is this guy on drugs
you impress me that you can remain polite when talking to an idiot like xray border guy
wtf was that second guy saying lol
i dont have much hope for the future
mexicans for trump
not a wall but a bunch of rfid xray checkpoints which one seems more intrusive
x ray border wtf does anyone realise how fuckin insane that is  anti wall pro x ray border
okay that second dude was a complete neanderthal but honestly hearing how the first lady had to whisper her question at the end was kinda sad
build the wallbuild the wall
age of consent is 12 in mexico  no choe moes in the usa
building a wall is a stupid fucking idea it wont stop illegal immigration and itll cost us tax payers an insane amount of money
008 holy shit tread carefully they target people like this lady for doing such a thing i would not reveal her identity of at all possible
holy shit that second guy is next level fucking retarded
that dude is part of the drug problemnot sure what exactly but he actd pretty strange and looked to me like he was on something 
the second guy wants americans to hate legalillegal immigrants by turning the whole country into a police checkpoint instead of having those checkpoints at the borderbrilliant
build the wall with a gun line
dumb liberals
i dont know the scientifical word 
mastermind individuals sounds like some evil stuff right there
america is already fucked spic is your second language lol
spaniards dont have mexican accents tho
510 that motherfucker is lying his ass off that accent of his is pure chicano as in a hispanic bornhere in the us with family that is of mexican decent he literally was going to say that he was from spain and changed his story at a split second if his family has been here since 1500s he would not be talking that way
i havent laughed this hard in a minute thank you
loving the short shorts man great video keep it up
the left never have a realistic answer
everything increases just like technology  no thats crazy talk
1058  scientifical  looked it up heres the meaning  adjective     of relating to or based on science of the nature of sciencei think its considered an obsolete or archiac form of scientificwho says scientifical any more where is this guy learning english from a 16th century dictionary
the proper scientifical 
thisguy is dumb  a report just csme out that that millennials are less intelligent pacifically males he doesnt want to enforce the border but wants to give illegal immigrants citizenship  then wants them to follow the rules at the border  immigrant immigrated legally without realizing thats what he saying if they were immigrating legally we wouldnt have this problem
yea because microchipped people electronic codes or rfids giving your very location to the gvt is much better than just making sure our borders are secure idk but they gvt already has too much knowledge about its people as it is
la raza racist dont care about our laws
that guy completely agreed with the border and he didnt know it liberal left at work when they stop spewing the garbage cnn is feeding them and think for themselves they dont even know it but they agree with the right
we are all now dumber for having to listen to that guy
your face at the end says it all
i wouldnt have been shocked if the second guy would have said we should put sharks with freaking laser beams on their freaking heads in the rio grande
i would like to see you do change my mind on the theory of evolutionis it religion or science and what your view is  i appreciate your niche and hope everyone learns to think critically after watching your videos thx
this dude just made us immigrants look bad
a wall solves nothing  gop wants to cut social safety nets because we need to get our spending under control but then want to piss away 25 billion on something that solves 0 problems  if you build it you will still have undocumented immigrants coming to us  it doesnt protect jobs or provide any securityif you want to solve undocumented immigrants then provide them an easy path to citizenship  it takes years and a lot of resources to become a citizen to the us  the people coming from mexico have zero resources  zero  so they are suppose to come here with no resources and participate in a process that requires resourcesas for security you could spend yourself into the poor house trying to be secure  free societies must accept certain amount of risk  i accept the risk we have now  pissing money on a wall wont lower my risk anymore than now because i feel my risk is almost 0
omfg that spanish non mexican plant actually hosts a programshow and plans to be a politician
never argue with someone who says scientifical theyre definitely a scientificalist
you need borders because local government is more responsive to the people in a global free world who controls the mess of humanity some random city in europe china how would they be able to understand the issues in brazil it doesnt work that way i believe in the future countries will get smaller russia and china will be among the first
i know it would be very unpopular but i wish we had a three strike rule you get caught crossing the border 3 times you get sent to work on the wall you are taught english and educated on passing the test to become a us citizen  youre given a set amount of money at the end of your sentence to start a new life in the united states i know people will see it as labor camps but it seems like a way to help everyone
ok lets just use drone strikes then
hes to emotional
i agree with that guy who said that transportation technology will improve and allow people to commute from anywhere around the world and then at the end of the day go back to their home country but i think that would strengthen national borders you wont have illegal migration problems and attempts to change demographics
that dude is strikingly stupid
im against the wall because i know and understand the purpose to keep illegal immigrants from coming in there masses but the whole idea to put a legit wall would be way to expensive and im not willing to pay from my tax dollars to support such a ridiculous cause i rather my money go to a family in need or a single mother  depending on her tax return just to keep going another year give me the choice i would think there had to be another cheaper way
haha an xray border no sane persons came to talk to you
who needs those pesky boarders lmfao
xray border would be way more expensive and less effective amd you can fogure that oit in 2 seconds with common semse
that guy ideas are so far off reality its like he lives in lalaland
how do we tax people who are already being exploited for cheap labor below min wage
the percentage of illegal immigrants that are breaking the law is 100
everyone please rise for your next new mexico governor
also after reading the comments remember that spain colonized mexico and california so his people may of been from spain originally
jared wants to build a wallwith a bunch of gloryholes in it
1550s damn
liberals are a subspecies
ladies find you a man that looks at you like steven looks at the camera after he nails one of these interviews
i am against the wall because i believe it is a complete waste of money it will not stop people from crossing illegally what i would do is issue out work visas let them work in the us if after 90 days of committing no crime they are given a residency card after so many days of committing no crimes they will be given the opportunity to become a citizen
that first guy watches to many movies lol
as a native new mexican i pray that man never becomes our governor
steven laid out those statistics for the second guy he looked like me in fucking algebra lmao
build the wall
so that guy was basically wants to put pet micro chips and have a scanner broader without using the word boarder huh ok yea sure
do abortion is wrongchange my mind
that face at the end says it all
i happen to be an expert on a lot of scientifical rays and i think that guy should not be governor of the sanctuary city new mexico
iq matters  these two retards cant express a single coherent thought or logical sentence because they are genetically unable  we dont need to import more retarded people we have more than our fair share already
the future governor of new mexico ladies and gentlemen
wow i would have told leroy to just go omg you have patience lol good interview
u shouldve said all the illegal immigrants are breaking laws lol the second person i dont think understood anything
what study shows that illegal immigrants commit 35 of homicides
lt says to the the second guy dont smoke crack
hungary put up a razor wire fence and it stopped most illegal immigration into the country
im staying far away from new mexico just in case
it is unfortunate that this guy hosts a show that i hope no one watches smh
maybe do this one over again with someone who has an actual argument
i couldnt even watch that last guy
thanks crowder you just made everyone dumber by forcing us to listen to that mindless drivel coming out of that future governors mouth  that was like watching a wounded animal fighting for its life i was screaming at the screen for you to put him out of his misery
im surprised because i expected this one to be pretty lame because i dont agree with the wall but you were so incredibly understanding with that first lady and you hit it right on the nose with fake victims creating real victims bravo
this guy is on another level xray scanner borders theyll zap you if you come in illegally
that first lady you can tell she lives in fear due to illegals committing crime and she could be won over on the wall its just they think its going to be an easily breeched wall if we put in technology to monitor the ground like they use with earthquakes and say infared above ground and stationed security over it it would work i do like how she wanted a number and to know where to call and how to report those lawbreakers i hope you guys helped her out by giving her a number the guy who claimed his family was spanish from spain uh yeah sure buddy thats a flat out lie im betting he was an illegal he had that same mexican american accent and you can tell with the majority of his family and friends hes not speaking english
i wish you had done this right outside the gunshop i work at i actually have a coworker who believes that we should have open borders while i do not agree with that stance since he doesnt get the fact that not only does that allow more drugs into the country but it allows terrorists rapists kidnappers who would sell children for money on the black market illegal weapons dealings would go up and also the fact that some radical groups in the middle east would sorely take advantage of that in order to destroyconquer us we also would lose many of our freedoms and our rights that the constitution grants us us citizens since we most probably in this scenario would be more under the laws of the united nations and thats no good lets not forget murderers on that list of people that would come across the border too
walther  whalther  whats nexta fucking mossbergwhats wrong with a sig ruger or a goddamn smith  wesson smiff n wessin for you colored folksamerican patriot my ass
please try this again man
i want my 13 minutes back
xray border sounds pretty scary big brother is watching
we dont need to import more criminals we have plenty of citizen criminalswhy does 2nd guy think chipping people like animals is ok thats amazingly stupid if the government starts chipping immigrants or illegals then how much longer before they do that to everyone sounds like the mark talked about in revelations to me good grief
alright times up lets do this leeeeeeroooooooooyyyyyyy jeeeeenkinnnssssss
1318 same
steven i like your show but i feel like these people are talking with emotions and not facts i think that your show would be a lot better if maybe you set up around the areas that is being affected try talking about this subject to people who live near the boarder i know this boarder affects everyone in the us but it could have a different impact to people who live next to the boarder then the ones who live in like kansas also the two gender might have a different view if you talk to people who live in a lgbtq community thanks
i support xray boarders with maido bots that anally probe each incoming immigrant
america is the greatest country in the world change my mind
im a legal immigrant and the second guy makes me want to deport myself
all the people who did a driveby or walkby f you is the reason why i hate the left naive idiots with a childish mentality
omg that guy doing his own show is delusional 
44 on trending what kind of alternate reality have i stepped into where youtube is allowing crowder on trending
after watching the video the person didnt convince me he knows any thing about immigration just take take take boot him out too
the second guylmao i cant so oblivious
databaseuhpastuhwalluhborderuhopiatesuh sorry but if your family has been here since the 1550s why do you sound like you just hopped the border
essentially the second guy wants to create second class citizens he specifically says he wants to give them a electronic id tag so then they dont have the same privacy rights as americans just an absurd argument
i feel for new mexico
this dude just delusional at best   hes just another guy who doesnt like the idea of a wall just because of the way it feels and he has no concept of national sovereignty or rights
the wall is stupid and a waste of money people would find away to get through it either going under or straight up just breaking it we should focus more on getting rid of drug cartels by making drugs legal here in the  us and taking away theyre income and power
the guy contradicts himself all the time
i live in new mexico and have yet to meet someone of mexican heritage its always spanish which is so odd   sorry this is in response to the first guy
climate change isnt caused by human activity change my mind
dont build a wall that would be too expensive build an xray boarder
over 4000 americans are killed every year from illegals enough bullshit talk build the fucking wall
that was the dumbest change my mind ive watched that guy was an idiot the conversation was useless no valid points made
the second guy is so uneducated and clueless that it is painful
he wants to be the governor 
wow lmao
1up for xrayborders
wow  i think i got dumber watching this
yes lets tag people and have no border not smart
hahahaha oh man 
2nd dude came into this all passion and made an ass out of himself
hey second guydrugs are bad mmmkaydrugs are bad
did you watch the same campaign video regarding trumps and mexicans that the rest of us did
it saddens me to see how rude people have become over politics it used to be something you didnt discuss at the thanksgiving table because it was awkward but now people are yelling and screaming in the streets
the best way to stop illegal immigration is to conquer you see what has happened when we stopped adding stars to the flag the only thing that can stop socialism is the constitution since the 1900 theyve been showing down expansion of that great document and changing it for the worse in most cases
well you dont see that every day people who are willing to have a calm political discussion about illegal immigration
do this one in detroit im huge fan i think i could change your mind easily after showing you how much the wall would supposedly cost
there was a time in our country history that we must always remember to it was an inspiration then it still can nownot like the brazen giant of greek fame with conquering  limbs astride from land to landhere at our seawashed sunset gates shall standa mighty woman with a torch whose flameis the imprisoned lightning and her name mother of exiles from her beaconhandglows worldwide welcome her mild eyes commandthe airbridged harbor that twin cities framekeep ancient lands your storied pomp cries shewith silent lips give me your tired your pooryour huddled masses yearning to breathe freethe wretched refuse of your teeming shoresend these the homeless tempesttossed to mei lift my lamp beside the golden door  new colossus
oh no leroy what is you doing baby
its crazy that people think that taxing people that they dont know exist and think that these people will all be law abiding citizens and they deserve to be there more than people who follow the legal processes
the problem with the id system this guy is proposing is control  the type of control needed to establish the system would stamp on this nations civil rights 
crowder stop talking to these idiots they dont represent the best counter arguments
holy shit the guy proposing a horrible dystopian big brother solution where all citizens are tracked by xray scans but doesnt want to build a wall because borders are dumb
after crowder got schooled in the socialism is evil debate they must screen people and if your iq is over 100 your not allowed to sit down d
she has an id badge on get a good screen grab and find out who she is
we should have open borders because of some technology that doesnt exist lol
i agree with a lot you have to say but this topic i dont agree at all
so this dude says that people that come to america illegally should get citizenship thats very smart
congrats on to 2 million subs
did crowdeer say 40 percent of homicides are committed by illegals he also cites 80 some odd percent of homicides being committed by blacks can somebody clarify
so tag emface palm
a wall will also keep you inside
so the dude basically wants  control over immigrants and the border control to know who is entering and why but also wants it to look super cool and not like a wall
i guess watching too many scifi movies does affect your grasp of reality
tax mexicans in americayour not mexican you family lived in mexico since 1550 right
did he say electrical tag
revoke birthright citizenship retroactively deport them all
wellthat second guy was rough not much else to say without being mean lol
no wall 1 it way to expensive  2 build a 100ft tower 2 miles in from the border have 1 every 2 miles crime eachother  each tower gets 3 spotters and 3 snipers 24hrs a day if the an individual crosses illegally and makes it a mile in and is spotted they get 1 warning shot at there feet they should at that point turn and run home if they dont 50 cal round to the dome the footprint of the wall is to much it will destroy the lands of many farmers and ecosystem of the entire border a few hundred towers on the other hand a minimum foot print especially to areas a wall would destroy a farm or an agricultural field it takes maybe a week to build a 100ft tower and maybe 3 trucks and some employees a wall 100rds of trucks 1000snd of employees and the construction site is tore up for years years compared  to a week ill take a week to construct place snipers and spotters in towers and have a secured border in a month instead of 20 years from now
no good reason were given for building the wall
that young mans suggestions sound super expensive
their afraid of the wall because they know it will work
i dont want illegal immigrants in my country but i also dont want a border  jezuz christ
i live in new mexico and i will make sure that i openly campaign against the guy who wants to run for office he sounds like a politician no ideas but lots of fire no way leroy
the wall would cost way to much the soldiers would cost to much and people can dig or swim to by pass the wall i dont like illegal immigration but people are determined
the spanish guy wants people to take the mark of the beast
i just cant wait to see when americans get in to war and they get stuck on their country trying to jump in to mexico
wow thats the future gov of new mexico once he gets those masterminds together heard from the future wanna go to the us nah man i cant too many xrays from past trips got me all cancer filled maybe next week
writing an essay is hardly free flowing hahaha
the last guy was sooooooooo stupid the ilegals wouldent regiter for its xray borther because they dont want to be in any registry not to be deported lol
go green global hahahaha
just build the wall 
mexico no va a pagar putos
holy crap this guys a moron
its nauseating how delusional the second person is lets just chip people read 1984 buddy your ideas would put us in the fast lane towards the orwellian nightmare society is already aimed at i dont want to mischaracterize people who are against the wall or border security more broadly but poor arguments seem to be the norm not the exception there isnt a logical reason not to want a secure border you can still have easy and fluid movement of people without erasing our national boundaries we already bring in more immigrants than any nation on earth of any nation of all time why is it immoral to deny entry to an illegal immigrant but totally acceptable to ignore the lower classes that were born here who disproportionately lose out on jobs and opportunity to illegal immigrants in the first place
so like an xray scientifical percentage or whateversome masterminds have free thoughts and you know i mean i see technology and electronic xray and so like yeah and borders wont exist and i want to be the governor of new mexico
drugsuh
that dude is fucking stupid lol scientifical x ray border lmao
that look at the end says it all lol
build the wall
god that mexicans an idiot i think borders are a thing of the past 
not against what the wall would do but isnt it true that most illegal immigration happens through mexicans flying into america on commercial chartered flights
damn steve these people really didnt know what they were talking about i now feel that we have an education problem in this country
i definitely agree with you but if you wanted more civil conversations and morecontent in general you could have worded it differently from build the wall something like im against illegal immigration would have been more appropriate for a civil discussion
that guy is far from being a governor
xray wall wow
that lady with the plant is retarded
its got to be hard to sit down with morons like this so there wont be borders in 5 years we have to rfid chip illegals and this dope is going to become a governor these libs have no way to base their arguments in reality lol come back when you can actually formulate an idea
nice video steven  fuck all those other people that were yelling shit at you
i am fully mexican i live there and i will for the rest of my life also i am a fan of yours and i was really interested in this topic and your point of view in this but you really show me nothing probably is becuse not many people sit with you and the ones who did didnt engage with you but i really would like to see another time this topic
the second guy i remember him from info wars  he was spitting on camera crew claiming he was a reporter arguing with reporter 
western civilization is the best change my mind
you guys do realize if the natives would  have built a wall there wouldnt be any whites in america or canada or anywhere everyone would be brown
the second guy is a perfect example of why we need a wall what the actual fxxx he is truely dangerous because he really believes in what he says
the wall would be a financial fiasco which probably wont even work there has to be another way to stop illegal immigration
so the dude wants to tag them like animals to track their migration patterns and somehow tax themseems pretty woke aside from the fact that he wants to enact a system that would allow people to apply for being here legally and taxedwhich already exist and is called applying for citizenship through a visa
i am against the wall because trump wants us to build it when it doesnt really help us i wouldnt mind as much if you were to pay for it but why not use the money youd use for the wall to pay more people to secure the borders of course you can see why im against the wall read my name im mexican i dont like the fact that theres a lot of people hating on us
morons like that are incredibly annoying know nothing idiots with big mouths are among the worst kinds of peopleplenty of dumbasses here commenting though too look the wall isnt a racial thing it just isnt it is incredibly logical for every single country in the world that needs to manage its population based on income citizens etc etc to know who is coming going and staying not hard to understandmeanwhile the real problem and the real killer is the 2200 tons of heroin meth and pot that keeps flooding over the border from people who would not hesitate to decapitate your whole familyboth sides of the political fence have been proposing border security for 35 years with their opposing side pointing their finger and calling them racists for it it is the exact reason why nothing has been doneand really you want to argue that we just need more border patrol and a wall is some archaic idea the biggest contributor to illegal drugs crossing unchecked and ripping apart many communities all over the countryis corrupt border patrol officials guys who are getting paid off and turning the other cheek concrete will do its job no matter how much money you try to give itbuild that fucking wall today and lets take back some control instead of letting a loudmouthed minority lower everyones comprehension levels with nonsense and talking points that dont even matter
the second guy was pro wall but just not a wall maybe long xray machines just dont call it xray wall or buildings line up across the border to check everyone best part was when he said he was gonna run for governor
what drugs is that guy on
x r a y b o r d e r s
new mexico is screwed
thank god donald trump is president
leroys idea would cost about a trillion dollars not being sarcastic
xray scanners and microchips thats more dehumanizing then a walllol
this is a difficult subject  so many components and potential problems  building a wall has its problems  will it work    how much money will it cost to kick the bad ones out  path the legalization  just to name a few        heres an idea  how about invade mexico and make it the 51st state grant all mexicans legal status so now they are paying their fare share forgive their foreign debt to us and in so doing increase our borders all the way to the panama canal  build a wall there  it will probably be cheaper        i know this opens a whole slew of problems that are foreseen and unforeseen  plz if this is possible how will it work and what would be some of the problems we would need to look out for
this guy from nm is an idiot his idea is what we already have with some sort of magic xray boarder crowders look after he was dismissed sums it up perfectly
friends i have years of experience in xray walls ive actually been considered to be head of xray wall technology in the space force join me we can do this
why would she even sit down when she is so paranoid some cartel guy see her 
445 how in the fuck can you tax someone when the government doesnt know they are here and most major transactions and employment are under the table hand to hand with cash
xray  checkpoint uuuummmmm what is that guy retarded
yeah electronic dog tags i get it  then if they cross over through the xray machine without a note or written permit it shocks them right 
why didnt you blur the whole image of that woman  she might get in trouble from the very identifiable attributes
im having trouble listening to the second guy too much ya like uhm you know keeps changing the subject and too much jibberish i wouldnt watch his show
the second guyhe doesnt want borders but wants security tags attached to people and check points to track where you are that thought process is a complete police statewhat in the world lol
did you just gave up on the second guy the xray scanner stuff makes no sense unless the thing take the whole border illegal will just not go through it
got a corona commercial before this video thought that was funny
i swear crowder always seems to find the dumbest people on the planet to debate these  if this is a sampling of humanitys future elon better get us to mars cause i wanna get off this train wreck
here i will save you a few minutes he says they should make it like so its like no borders but theres like a border and like with trump and like the xrays and like i do a lot of thinking and like it should be like a border or something but like with like spain but like mexico and the people will be like doing something with some technology and like trump and the wall u know
lady how do i report those peoplesteven hmmmmm
priceless look at the end haha
wow the sheer stupidity of these asshole leftist nuts are truly disturbing
how about this government sucks at everything including immigration wallbuilding and keeping us safe  why have faith in big g for this issue  look at healthcare social security medicare veterans affairs schools etc  big g sucks at it all  no wall please because its just a waste of money our money and make legal immigration easier  oh and make drugs legal  drug war has been a huge failure  legalization will undercut drug lords immediately  im not in favor of drug use on a personal level but again big g isnt good at anything
x r a y  b o r d e r
just tax em yeah like its that easy just tax em and its all good
yeah done watching at 532 cant take any more lol
crowder criticizes immigrants not paying taxes without a hint of ironythe president doesnt even pay taxes
we could pay mosquitoes to inject the chips too bad mosquitoes arent more agreeable
these people are 12 a step above those dummies who eat tide pods and we are supposed to take them seriously
dude came in like leeeeerroooyyyy treejoooo
this is hilarious best one so far in terms of comedy also can anyone tell me the conservative rebuttal for when a leftist brings up the argument that it costs tons of money
the look steve gave at the end was a perfect summary of how i feel everytime i hear these people open their mouth and let words spew out  so sad that a grown person is this irrational  lol illegals are going to grow microchips under their skin and by devine intervention be registered by some computer that will scan them and know who they are without ever setting foot in our country lol liberalism retards the brain to childlike standards
lol stevens face at the endpretty much sums it up
he changed my mind screw the wall i wanna xray wall
xray gate not a border but you know like a giant fucking airport tsa checkpoint 
445 when it comes to migration we could tax those people he says lolso illiterate farm workers that cant find work in an agricultural society leave that country to come to a technologically advanced society and somehow we think that theyre going to have great jobs that pay taxesthey are leaving mexico because they cant find any work doing the only thing they know how to do
i can advocate for the illegal immigrants causing trouble i have many family members here and some that have been deported that gave done serious crimes my grandfather murdered someone in the 90s and never got caught for it
people think the wall is racist like being illegal is racist
i think people confuse the subjects of closed borders vs secure borders
im against building the wall not bc i want people coming in illegally but bc its a giant fucking waste of money that our country needs to use in other places
i suddening have the urge to chase my tail after listening to that spaz
no difference building a wall up your ass to keep shit in as building a wall to keep shit out
it seems that everyone actually wants the same thing the left wants what the right can provide but the left is so emotional that they cant think straight enough to act as a functional human being the left can say how they want all these things but they do nothing to get them they are all talk its so mind blowing
this is horrible most of those people dont know what theyre talking about
damn that bitch a snitch
this needs a 2nd edition that dude was real dumb
did that dude just say his family has been in new mexico since the 1550s
statistically
that look on stevens face at the end made my day
second guy was a mess but that poor woman  contrary to popular belief its actually pretty hard to get someone deported  my cousin unknowingly married an illegal immigrant from brazil  he had lied to her about everything including his status  for some reason this didnt bother her but the rest of the family was pretty upset  my uncle hired a private investigator behind my cousins back we were afraid shed do something crazy like run off with the guy to find out more about him  he was wanted for attempted murder in brazil  of course we contacted ice but it took an entire year to get them to pick him up  send his ass home  we were shocked by how slowly everything moved  we had his name address daily schedule shocker  he didnt work  it still took so long  i cant imagine other cases where the people are a bit more slippery
so he wants a tag that can tell the government everywhere you go  oo  and where would this tag or mark be located maybe on the right hand or the forehead  oh and maybe no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark  how could that not end well  oo  xp
i love your shirt you do great work thank you steven
that look at the endsteven you deft bastard
that look at the end speaks volumes lol
xray borders tho or drones with netting
i so badly want to find one of these and debate with crowder because hes just so cool
we shouldnt build a wallwhat should we do with illegal immigrantstax them make them take the test fill out the papers and become a citizenwhat youre saying is they should become legal citizens cool were on the same page
id like to see another episode of this same topic hopefully you can get more people to sit down next time
leroy dumb as shiiiiiittttttt
wish i could have been there to have a discussion that would have been fun and i would have done much much better than the people that sat down
why dont you post the secularism is evil change my mind almost as if you only want to be portrayed right and all knowing 
haha the same sex parenting commercial for sodastream is hilarious
99 ill continue to be a cheap prick id even do up to 10 a month on patreon or something but not 99 at one time
that people hold the beliefs of the guy who sat down terrifies me
wow the second guy is a moronhe cant even put a sentence together he has no idea what hes even saying just regurgitating cliff notes from cnn and fb
wow just wow
you do it right steven love the show and all of the staff
400 ok chums lets do thisleeeeeeroooooy jeeeenkiins
you are the man  making money off of pissing off the cry babys in the world why couldnt i think of this first lol right on brother
i see the majority of the oppositions argument seems to be fuck you
honestly that guys idea made no sense whatever he was thinking would cost so much money and i dont see anyway that wouldnt be a huge violation of privacy
we need an xray wall with computer chips and when you go someplace trumpets sound an alarm and there is a harlot that rides a beast and a temple and some plagues and
only two people did you cut all the other people or was that all you got
leroy scares me
before id give my opinion on this i would ask the someone actually define this wall are we talking about a physical concretebrickmetal wall for the whole length of the border wouldnt that cost a shit ton of money
they will have to try this one again
i understand that mexican or people from mexico bring in drugs but that doesnt mean that people from other countries dont if there is a wall against the mexico border than make one for canada as well and and somehow be aware of the people coming overseas
yeah an xray border would be so much cheaper than a wall and it is totally cool to track everyone everywherenew mexico is hosed if this guy becomes leadership
now that thats done fuck that guy really the mayor pfft good luck taken bad guy voice
holy cow  good luck nm
hes wearing a walther tshirt hes such a bell end
holy shit people are stupidwhat happen to natural selection let the dumb ones walk off the cliff
its just turtles all the way down
i think this dullard is thinking of rfi so hes arguing that instead of a wall we can just chip the entire world and use rfi readers to track humans at all times gooooood solution sigh
that other guy was dumb af really he has a channel is he on meth
lol i knew he was from new mexico before he said it the way he talks the way he asks about the drugs yah well whos salling the drugs 713
that guy neds to lay off the espresso bigtime
this dude talking about the mark of the beast
i find it hilarious that when these mindless sheep are questioned on how to fix a problem their fix is for someone else to figure it out
you should have asked leeroy what his plan is when the immigrant doesnt bring his electronic tracking tag with them when they cross the border
new world order here we come
so tag the immigrants like migrant birds brilliant
this kid is crazy his thought make no sense i want them to go througha checkpoint but not have border checkpoints thats pretty much what he was saying hahahaha god damn
wow people are stupid
this guy with the xray idea needs to write a graphic novel id read it 
stevens face at the end about sums it up
whoever that guy with the backpack and gopro was shut the fuck up you have got to be the dumbest most cringe mother fucker anyone has ever had to hold a conversation with about anything jesus christ he was like that bug that played a human in men in black just fucking dumb as a sack of dicks acting educated i think there should be a screening process because you need to be mentally and factually equipped before sitting down with crowder
that 2nd dude cant be serious
thank god i watch these with a beer in hand
shouldve morphed her voice and clothes as well cause shes gonna get shot
let them in and tax them  does this guy really not understand where the incomes they would be taxed on come fromthere is already a shortage of jobs for those competing to fill them adding more people in no way increases the tax revenue  in fact illegals  unless they steal someones identity  dont pay taxes meaning theyre filling a job that a us citizen would have had and payed taxes fromand he seems to think theyre coming in to look for work  when the ice contact summary 2007  released to quiet our fears over them taking jobs  showed that less than 30 of illegals they had any contact with  had previously held a job were holding a job or were seeking a job  within the usthat means 70 are content to live off of social programs andor crime
i think you talked to a crazy person
10 years from now that guy will be governer and will punish us all with his xray passcode death machine bwahahahahaa
my grandma and my dad came here legally from germany my dad finished school and is now in his 60s and a retired us marine
if you think a wall is actually going to work you dont know much about history all hes going to do is waste money i also dont agree that we should just deport everyone but thats just me
that spanish guy lost every follower
i love what you do and how you do it steven crowder
wall we dont want a wall we should have like xray laser microchips things n shieeet
so he doesnt support the wall but wants everyone to be chipped how do you make sure they all get chipped if they can just walk across the border without going through the check point  logic really doesnt cross their minds does it
ur mum gay change my mind
i havent seen any comments from the 982 down votes hmm
everything that last guy was talking about would be fixed by a wall  you cant put up scanner stations all along the border they would be at doorways and to have a doorway you need a wall
an xray borderwhat the fuck
are you losing weight steven
i again want to say im not for a wall or paying for it but i would if medicaremedicaid and social security dont get touched
build hillarys wall oh shit sorry physical barrier build hillarys physical barrier
xray scannerthat guy is either a genious or stoned as faaarkthe 20 first correct answers donates 10 each to lowdah witha dah crowdah
an xray gate  not voting for this guy he is an incoherent mess
before watching the video and hearing your points my thoughts on the wall are that its a waste of money and will probably have minimal effects on illegal immigration and smuggling and so on i think that there are probably better ways to protect the border while also dealing with illegal immigration and smuggling ending the war on drugs would probably be beneficial at least for the issue of smuggling reducing the welfare state would almost certainly decrease illegal immigration while i am in support of borders and protecting said borders i dont think a wall will be so helpful in todays time
leroy for governor
like he thinks everyone is just going to stargate to paris and us in 10 yearshe is going to gather the think tank to make these policies and steve job all the neccessary tech to make it reality
build the wall
i may not be the smartest person in the world but im happy im not this stupid
that spanish dude is dumb lol
dude in white t shirt wants an electronic id tag so the mark of the devil is his answer for illegal migration
where would the illegals get the electronic information registered with the us for them to be checked in
they havent taken the time to think things through yes lets get rid of all borders so people can roam the world like a bunch of nomads all those suckers who own property and have to deal with random unidentified people entering their neighborhoods and causing crimes are just behind the times if youve held the same job for a long period of time you are doing it wrong instead you should be receiving basic income from the government so you arent tied down to one area and hold no allegiance to any land the government would be all too happy to pay a monthly pittance if it means they can acquire private property
hey steven i might be able to change your mind on building the wall its a huge waste of money it wont even cover the entire south border so illegal immigrants will just get through elsewhere or theyll keep building tunnels like they have been the wall is only going to make drugs and human trafficking an even more profitable business it wont achieve what its supposed to and you guys will be out all the money you spent on it
omg a xray gate that reads your id and then another one in the citydude i do not want to live in a scociety where you are tracked everywhere you go even if its pretty much possible now
 uh you report them to ice lol
the real reasons for being against the wall seem emotional thoughpeople dont know why theyre against or how else theyll solve the problem
for the lady it might be prudent to change her voice dub over or voice manipulation for her protection
in the check point stations in can be separated by country of origin to assist is pinpoint where migrants are coming and why this assist in humanitarian policies in those countries so we help with those issues to avoid those issues causing people to flee
borders are going to be a thing of the past buddy a border is essentially a law borders are structures that live by societally im so sick of morons suggesting we should get rid of rules and laws they are the bones the structure of society try and remove your own personal bones see how well you function
that stare into the camera 
i had to watch an ad for sodastreampride twice during this video advertising gay families
people are stupid man
leroy is the epitome of new mexicos public school system  currentformer teachers of all the leroys in america take note and own your disgraceful selves
wow that guy is so incoherent its sad unfortunately this is how dumbed down most people are nowadays
wtf is wrong with that guy
what would happen if all borders  were dissolved  
new mexicans are not spanish change my mind
so basically that one guy wanted everyone to have ankle monitors
he starts off by stating he is not mexican his spanish ancestors immigrated to mexico in the mid16th century if your ancestors have lived in mexico for several hundred years you should identify as a mexican he sounds racist himself and how are they going to identify as americans if they cant even identify with the culture theyve been a part of for hundreds of years but the biggest joke is he thinks the criminals and also the poor and illiterate are going to pay taxes
im hispanic colorado pioneer pro gun dont build the wall why  because we are mexican mexican we can do anything and everything we will get threw that wall so fast its a waist of money
unedited but only 14 minutes
theres no way you can stop it and it will just get worse  really how come the rest of the world has no problem enforcing their borders because illegal migrants know theyll have their teeth kicked in for fucking with them why not respond with asking why every other country is not required to be relaxed with migrants why are they allowed to maintain near 100 racial purity and close down legal and illegal immigration why have we watched our country decrease from near 90 european in the 70s to sub 60 with that number on a fast trajectory down when the demographics put migrants in the majority position  ask them how they plan to treat whites the group that crowder is not allowed to talk about have organized a standdown of the border  and will  be in an even greater position of power as they giggle at the destruction of their longtime cultural enemy crowder can take a bow for playing a helping hand in their unchallenged victory
for example id suggest more checkpoints every 100 miles and at hot spot crossing areas the hot spots can be like and airport or dmv this would create more jobs between the check points is where i compromise and have a wall and border patrollaw enforcement
great stuff 
i like how this guys thinks were living in the minority report movie and we can moniter everyone with xray camera everywhere they go
the spanish gentleman proves congress isnt doing their job and actually enforcing procedures that work congress just wants to play politics and false promises they didnt complain about the previous administration was never complained about because the government was our 1 that tried to hold us down being dependant on a person or a thing is not freedom
these people are so dumb i live next to these illegal immigrants my entire city is illegal immigrants these people dont wanna be taxed thats why they try to get here illegally i talk to so many of them and they say they would rather get a bunch of goverment help have a f ton of babies than do anything useful in the us they get all the help and do nothing to contribute to us im hispanic myself and i say build the damn wall and gets all these damn nontax paying mexicans out of here if only all you would see how much these people abuse us help i was talking to one and i asked her when she was gonna get a job and she said never if i want more help from the us ill just have another baby thats her words
building a wall across the border isnt really going to change the fact that people still would like to get in to the united states because of the  freedom  and libertywe so called have building a wall isnt going to stop immigrants or immigration building a wall is just going to stir things up a notch a its getting people to act accordingly  not in a good way  instead of building walls trump should use that money wealth for the people and schools and cities all around the nation that are in great poverty what ever ethnicity you are if youre not native youre an immigrant to this land your self nobody had a wall up or had intentions of a wall being built when ancestors ran through america like  if it were theirs  yeah some might be criminals yeah some are hard working but what people fail to realize is that some are doing as they please committing crimes and forgetting why they came here only because already  us citizens  are showing to them that they dont even care about rules and regulations so what would people do  follow the leaders  legal us citizens   whites blacks asians latinosmuslims alll commit crime on a regular and we arent getting the same treatment at this point theres just somethings against them im a proud us citizen but im not proud on how this nation put things together
gays are gay change my mind
i can barely get through these videos because of all the cringe hey mexicans if your such good workers and good people go back to mexico they need you more than we do
steven crowder is sexy change my mind
the intro tho lmfao
that one  spanish dude was high and very brainwashed into believing that nwo is goin to bring a borderless society so he hears his info from here and there  lol now  i feel for that first lady  u all needed to cover her voice and entire body more
he was making an argument for the mark of the beast the beast is already a physical super computer in the usa its not a prophecy anymore louderwithcrowder please address this im not dying with a chip in me
incoherent nonsense from the left who would have thought
illegals get out reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
huh an xray border that tracks illegals by gps im sure thatll go over well
what the crap is that dude talking about its one thing to be thought a fool and the other to open your mouth and prove it
there is a lot to unpack for this difficult topic there isnt juat 1 thing that can be done to fix it im not a supporter of a wall but i can compromise
are you serious homeboy is actually calling for 1984 hope he never gets to leadership in new mexicoguess we just need to start chipping people so we know where they are  what they are doing at all times soon we will have such advanced chips that we will even know what you are thinking that way we can work together to correct itwhat in the holy fuck
crowders face at the end of the video basically described how i felt watching this 
im against building another wall we already have one and broader patrol this wall will cost too much of our tax payers money and besidesmost illegals travel here by plane for vacation and then dont leave when their visa expires a wall cant stop that change my mind
the wannabe mayors arguments were so incredibly laughable and bad although i thought his point about pharmaceutical companies was actually really good
fucking leftism
a digital id tag and database for he realize the ramifications that would bringthese people are begging for tyrany
well i am definitely 100 percent an anarchist when the illusion of authority is no longer believed a wall on an imaginary line will be on no ones mind stupid argument
low iq
jeez i didnt know this segment was called cringe my mind
seriously what a dumbass illegals dont want to become citizens because they would have to pay taxes and they would also be subject to our laws and they dont give a shit about any of that
steven crowder youre the bravest person in america  god bless you
its nice to hear that the solution to illegal immigration isnt stronger borders but instead stronger borders
that first guy had me when he said scientifical
scientifical this guy is a moron period
omg that 2nd guy is genius what an amazing idea have everyone coming into the us enter a passcode and go through an xray why hasnt trump thought of this its just such an amazing realistic simple way that doesnt require a wall
build the xray wall
gates are normally attached to a wall or fence of some sort good luck governor
borders will be a thing of the past in about 5 to 10 years  
gov of nm u cant even complete a full sentence moron
that guy who wants to tax illegals and make money off of them must have the worst podcast in existence because he is terrible at explaining whatever point it is that he is making smh
an xray boarder yeah lots of radiation sounds great id totally vote for this guy for mayor
that spanish guy  was he on something
honestly as a fan of the show and a mexican all i think a wall will do is create more problems but thats my opinion ill still keep watching your beautiful shows steven with the intent of learning new things everyday 
build it
do you sell any decals
make them be citizens how by pointing a gun at them  they have the opportunity now to be citizens
the first sit down was heartbreaking to hear
i love these segments keep it up man
i think the second guy watches a lot of movies and told he is special a lot
a wall didnt work for china in the long  run didnt work for germany will probably not work for israel or usa
im thinking about becoming the governor of new mexico oh dear god
this was more cringeworthy than anything these were some low iq people wow
this spanish guy really piss me off what if i want to go to usa i have to pay for visa get background check and then i can get to usa meanwhile this fuckers from the south cross the border illegally and 50 of americans think its ok
everyone agrees that there should be a path to citizenship taxing people getting them in etc thats all legal citizenship they need to change the path build the wall make a checkpoint make the path to citizenship cheaper and easier and allowing for vetting process that doesnt allow anyone with a violent criminal history
crowder why didnt you call out this guys bad idea by pointing out how are you going to get people to go through a check point to be scanned in if they can easily cross the border miles away from any check point missed opportunity
that dude is a fucking moron ive never heard anything that stupid
that guy wants to be governor of new mexico  hes been thinking about the issues a lot for 3 years  and he still doesnt know shit
that guy was giving me anxiety with how fast and loud he was talking 
dear god people are stupid
the guy is proposing we microchip mexicans mark of the beast
your patience is absolutely amazing when you do these segments
omg
854so does this guy think were going to have teleportation soon or something 
that second guy wants to electronic tag illegals just like you electronic tag an animal he wants illegals to be treated like animals i can see that going over like a lead balloon lol
omg this one was painful to watch uneducated people trying to sort out problems they have no idea about
why is it never brought up that there are border checkpoints to come in legally
borders are going to become a thing of the past too much pot for this guy
mindless zombies
maybe there should be an iq test for all immigrants lower than 115 will get you refuted
he is being too kind with this moron
kid in white shirt is clueless the retardation of america is complete
the guy against the border wall admitted he was shooting from the hip and didnt know much about the topic yet he was determined to keep his opinion maybe take a period of information gathering before getting entrenched in your opinion
so many people are against illegal immigration and do t even know it because the press conflates legal and illegal immigration to the point that most people literally dont know the difference they just know trump wants a wall and their told that they shouldnt because they voted hillary
they send their money to mexico u idiot spaniard
that kid sounded like a little hitler lets just track everyone everywhere they go and what they do holy st
i was very surprised that the people that liberals and the left say should be attacking you were peaceful but the liberal leftists themselves who say they are peaceful were attacking you
the cringei cant believe how dumb this guy is and he plans to be governor lol
no one cares if ur mad build the wall these ppl mexicans are so racist an cant see past their own nose dumb ppl dude we dont care get em all out every single illegal get them out close the border completely
that last guy was about as intelligible as a miss america pageant contestant
i got a better idea lets just build two sphinx statues that shoots laser beams from their eyes and vaporizes anybody who have no intentions of wanting to come over legally it worked in the neverending story so boom fucking genius
he wants the machine used in total recall to scan people walking through it
wow people are stupid
that kid was on crack
we dont need a wall just a checkpoint xray gate where they can check who comes in and out so you mean a border and a passport
so basically tag people like animalsidiot
republicans need to start a campaign educating their stance people keep associating legal immigrants with the republican policy of keeping illegals out
xray scanner
the sovereignty of nations means nothing to these people they want a one world multicultural nation at this point i want canada to build a wall your illegals are coming into my country at ten times the rate they used to
guys you have to protect the identity of the first speaker better id card voice jewellery this person could face some repercussion from the criminal elements in that community
xray border that sounds brilliant
before russia tore down the wall in germany the us military used to have bases along the mexican border to keep out russian spies during the cold war i still think that while they build the wall they should put up military training sites an arrest people if they trespass on these training sites with live ammunition it wouldnt be an arrest for crossing the borders you would be arrested for trespassing on military training bases then no one can claim that they are being arrested for crossing the border because they would be arrested for trespassing on military bases training with live ammunition and the military police could arrest you which would increase border security
god i hate your youtube channel so much stop showing up on my feed
i like what crowder does here as a liberal its nice to have an articulate educated presentation of the other side of the argument to think on having said that this comment section is just a massive republican circle jerk
the xray border guy is ready to run for the dmc he has good chances beating maxine walters
oh my god hahaha that guy didnt have a clue what he was talking about and has watched one too many scifi movies
just a group of told how to thinkers
100 of undocumented immigrants have committed a crime
only 13mins long why dude thats dumb waist of time
why not fix the corruption in mexico then they wont need to come here but we still need the wall
you cant have an xray doorgateetc without a wall  dummy
my great grandfather came illegally but he became a citizen
you cant tax who you dont know is here
this man is trying to sound smart by coming up with a movie idea
that spanish dude is a fucking idiot
lefty wall badsteve whylefty  um never got this far
climate change next
okay steven ive watched a couple of your videos  your courage to have controversial topics in public is amazing new topic for change my mind anarchy is good change my mind
while the border should be secured why have you never looked at the deeper root of the issue mexico is a corrupt failing state that we only use as a timeshare investment in cancun why not work with mexico as a neighbor and get the cartel out of the pockets of the government and create a better nation that doesnt incite its people to flee to america we need to stop being small minded about these issues just building a wall is a waste
yo steven make news channel
lady any legal citizen can return to the us from any country thats why you have id and a passport
we cant microchip people we arnt cats
why does crowder always change his words to confuse a person its super annoying he gets him to agree to there beinga certain amount of people that dont pay taxes and then he tells the guy he agreed to it being a lot or a majority come on man you gotta do better 915
more change my mind gun control those are always fun
my only question is how do we finance the wall if thats the path were actually going to go downi think that money could better be spent on actual immigration reform  making the system for legal immigration more effective  a wall is a symbol  but its about as effective as a fenceif we have enough money to build the wall  we could probably investigate spending that more appropriately
that dude is trying to make total recall real
yes tag all of the people coming across the border i see no humanitarian concerns here at all its like the people he talks to havent thought about the actual issue at all
 dude said xray scanner wtf these people are fools why are these clowns allowed to vote these are the ones destroying america
sooo and xray border  yeah   bahahahahahahahahahahaha
when your parents are your primary source of income you just cant take part in adult issues im sorry youre misinformed and unprepared for life take a seat somewhere else your level of intellect is far too low to voice your opinion
austin is fuckin weird
part ii deport em all  change my mind
the only reason the majority of antiwallers dont want a wall is it sounds mean they never think of the ramifications of their supposed charity  an xray border does this guy have any idea of how expensive that would be or how impractical it is a wall is a way to funnel people to a controlled point its neutral
hahaha how was that for a cold open 
we need a large xray scanner guess if its a true xray scanner you can see smuggled goods 
the jim look from the office at the end is amazing lol
5  19 the motorcycle sounds like scary music in the background ahaah
lmao at the stats from 630700 total bullshit that illegal immigrants commit over 30 of americas murders and contribute to 7080 of drug trafficking arrests
these people are extremely annoying because most cantput together their ideas and explain their ideas with clarity
poor steven you got the b team on this one hahaha
damn i wish i was there too argue with you im sure i could have come up with some good points not about illegal immigration but how isolation has usually led to a great depression or war in the past
wait wait i have an idea its gonna blow your mind xray border
the latin guy is out of his mind
i thought most illegal immigrants came through with visas and just stayed illegally if that is true then the wall is not worth building i believe other areas of immigration reform need improvement
an xray scanner i like that lol
i cant stand when people say that illegal immigrants have rights here in the country they bring up the constitution they fail to comprehend that the constitution applies to citizens of the united states illegal immigrants are not us citizens so therefore have no right in our country
these people are just generally dumb and unable to form a proper argument
what if we fine the enabling citizens  companies hiring illegal immigrants like 50k per instance
i know americans are dumb but i didnt know they were that dumb lol its quite concerning that a powerful nation like america is run by idiots who dont know fuck all about anything
x ray border space force and donald trump as president am i in a tv show
i dont know how you sit there with a straight face and listen to these people with out laughing hysterically some of the stuff they say is so ridiculous anyways keep up the good work
do the earth is round change my mind
nobody sat down because nobody could think of a reason why it shouldnt be built
theres zero downsides to building a wall unless of course youre ok with illegal votes
the only reason the mexican lady doesnt want the wall is most likely for illegal reasons shes worried that other family members may never make it across if its built if she is living here legally and has family living happily in mexicothen she can drive across the border in between the walls and see them it wont effect her one bit its not an inconvenience either i would understand if the wall had special technology that scanned your brain took naked x ray pics scanned your fingerprints and sent you spam email foreverthen id be against it too but its a piece of cement that you drive around lets build the wall already or come up with something better doesnt have to be a wall but lets get some better ideas then
honestly these two people couldnt make a valid argue ment i shouldve been on here
your facial expression 1315 lol
taxing them would force them into poverty and will cause them to do whatever they can to make the money ie drug trafficking
we need an xray scanner what if we just have superman scan the border
its sad you cant even have proper discourse without having your own secret service protecting you how have we gotten so dumb if youre unwilling to think then why bother having an opinion
worded very poorly 605 lol what im not on either side but trump literally said mexicans bring killers rapist and drugs  fact check
i feel sorry for the woman she is doing her best but doesnt understand how the wall will helpthe second person was a complete moron does he realize that tagging everyone is basically siding with the nwo agenda yea we could rfid tag everyone like cattle but do you really want to open that can of wormswe need a physical barrier that can deter or hopefully stop 98 of the illegal crossings to help lower crimedrug crossings going back to the woman that was first interviewed you can see how abused the innocent ones are and how theyve been turned silent by the cartels
that last guypretty sure he thinks were going to have flying cars and some kind of star trek transporter in the next few years
the problem with open borders is that 7 billion people will all live in the usa there will be no land to build homes or grow food and everyone starves to death
my grandma is from england and my mom from the philippines both legal
stephen did you find the dumbest people you couldi usually love these videos but i feel like the 2 people here were never a worthy adversaryget some real master debaters p
37 of the murders lol  cant change minds that are irrational
its like i was listening to someone pitching a futuristic script to a director xray borders tracking devices barcodes body scanners haha if done right it could be one of the best scientifical fiction movies of all time
omg lmaf your face  the end 
just build the wall and put them on the other side of it already
423 its always going to be a good debate when you get someone with opinions that you disagree with vs someone who you disagree with 
i think you should have blurred the first woman entirely body included voice distorted it sounds like she could be in danger from criminals in her community if they see this they might be able to recognize her based on voice and body shape im actually worried for her tbh hope nothing bad happens to her and she is able to report the people without harm
the second guys go on so many different tangents i physically can watch it
that was painful
because i dont hear of a 1 ton bail of pot floating south of the american boarder every 3 months
these people seem to think that having a boarder wall means that nobody comes through the boarder anymore we are not walling off mexico so nobody can get in or out
wouldnt a borderwall be stupidly expensive
the second guy is a complete dumbass
the second guy basically said make them legal by going through the system but the problem is these people couldve done that but chose not too i came here to the usa on a k1 visa it took time and money but now im here and dont need to worry about ice these people broke the law and people are now defending them just to be agaist trump people make me laugh
they better build 2 walls  just in case they make it over the first one
that guy is an illegal alien
i for one will not be holding my breath waiting for that email
my lord the spanish gentleman certainly has a lot of ideas about topics about which he clearly is completely ignorant i love how he says no borders and then goes on to describe a cyberpunk border
i cant make sense of what any of these people say lol
yea mayn im anti borders but lets have a border thatll xray dem and tell the government who dat is
ive been to spain and that second guy my have some spaniard in him and ive been to mexico and that dude is highly mexican
haha make them citizens it costs 800 per person who should pay that i wonder
leroy is amazing in his own way dude is hilarious i genuinely think he wants to help solve the problem and he certainly has the enthusiasm to be a part of the solution that being said i dont think he understands the concept of law he doesnt want people just crossing the boarder but thinks they should go to a check in station with a note instead i mean thats basically what a legal boarder crossing is currently and your visa would be your note he seems like he wants to create a place of rule and law that still allow for people to legally get here to better themselves and their lives unfortunately the only way this works is with our current welfare system is with closed boarders defund the wellfare state and then open the boarders the 2 are mutally exclusive leroy needs to dive down the rabbit hole some more and learn about why people do what they do instead of just assuming it you cant have it illegal to cross a boarder unless you present a note then its legal that makes it defacto legal just write yourself a note
stop at the doctor to get your electro id tag and a note so you can cross the xray non border
just tax thembuddy theyre illegal what makes you think theyre going to pay taxes
did the second guy said he wants to be a governor g helps us all he wants xraysss numbers for everyone that entershe agrees that everyone should be countedisnt that a virtual wall
thats a pretty shitty idea and kind of orwellian when considering its only effective application
so an xray border hahahaha
the right lets make it harder for criminals and people who dont contribute helpfully to our society to enter as americans we have the right to take any means necessary to keep our people safe a wall is the best idea so far the left dont build a wall why not i dont know
the look on crowders face at the end said it all
does the wall plan to have turrets aimed at airplanes most of illegal immigration comes by plane otherwise its a big waste of tax payer money and dont say mexico will pay for it because they wont lol the wall also will lock some illegal mexicans in the usa based on the plans where it will be built the wall was more of a way for trump to get votes build a wall sounds good sounds like you are gonna protect the country with strong borders but when you break it down its a silly idea just think logically for a few moments
ladder
if you make it easy for people to come then you dont need a wall people will take the easy route at a port of entry but because legal migration takes so long they cross the border of ilegally likewise the drug war is another issue that should be ended that only makes the immigration debate more ridiculous the drug war is a failure and will undoubtedly be entwined with other ilegal activity im not sure where crowder got his stats on immigrant crimes but if they are from the scaap these numbers he used were cherry picked and dont accurately reflect crime of course still with the drug war crime will be inflated lets make it so anybody can come here remove the lottery and quotas people have the right to travel and open borders is the only morral system
second guy sooooo ignorant
how much you want a bet those illegal immigrants  shes talking about are just american citizens that are brown lol
smhthat second dude is so cringe
i one day plan on being the governor of new mexico lol has anyone told him hes gotta get elected to do that
please dont let him become the governor of any state
dam that second guy was a moron uhhhhh mastermind individuals lmao xray scanner  keep them coming chief
conclusion  spanish drugs  everything else
i started off as saying wow this guys down to earth then as i continue watching i lose so much faith have you never heard of a ladder or a tunnel your opinions and debates get more stupid and stupid by the second
i agree with steven on a lot of stuff but build a wall is a little too far yes the people that come her illegally should be punished but the was of doing it is hard to catch everybody who does but a wall can bring us into being bankrupt if we spend billions on it
a scientifical xray wall lol
it is so hard to listen to this one
taxation is slavery
wow that guy was an idiot
cant fool me  that second guy just wants an xray wall so he can see immigrant boobs under their clothes as theyre crossing over
pogo
the 2nd dude reminds me of kai the hatchet wielding hitchhiker
the proper scientifical ray yeah uh
this nut sounds like he wants to serial number immigrantssounds similar to what the germans did a while back huh
to summarize that last guy build an xray fence and tag every citizen south of the xray fence with an rfid and gps trackers then initiate intercontinental observation and tracking of every single person for the purposes of the us government can everyone draw enough parallels with nazitime jews in germany and concentration camps or do i need to point them out
that look at the end lol prepare new mexico thats your future governor
havent you seen family guy crowder its called drive by disagreeing
this is a free thought that i have been thinking about for 3 years because governor but i would have to talk to a group of people scientifical
on trending 
stevens face at the end lmao 
first please stop using the wall in israel as an example us borders are so much wider also apples and orangesthe cost it would require to construct such a massive project alone not including upkeep would put us further into debt and the impact it would have on illegal immigration would be nominalpeople fly over dig tunnels swim you name it they do it id like people to go through the proper channels to become a citizen anywhere but we all know you can wish in one hand and shit in the other and youll know which will fill first all the same id like to hear a better idea than an expensive wall that future generations will pay forhow bout legalizing drugs thatll cripple the cartels i know big pharma will fight it but well fuck them also automate more lowpaying jobs that illegals tend to take look at agriculture its done mostly by machines now plenty of ways to take incentives away instead of wasting tax payer dollars with short sighted ideas
i dont know the scientifical ray  lmfao
i mean instead of building a wall spending 20 billion why not make jobs helping make the border stricter  im not for illegal immigrants coming in but why waste 20 billion  just make jobs for people of our country to keep them into their country  i like that taxes thing the second guy said 
how about everyone of them that lie on an i9 brakes the law lying in a federal document is a crime
build a scientifical xray border lol
omg deport the mastermind individual
i dont get why if youre educated you can support the building of the wall yeah illegal immigrants should not be let in however it is a huge cost of taxpayer money why dont you mention these unnecessary costs while we in this day are cutting down on education and funding this sort of thing come on man
europe cant even build a union and you are thinking borders will disappear in 5 years are these people real are those youre voters good god
xray gate guy for president 2020
omg people i believe in a wall  not trump supporter but it helps both countries in many ways
canada needs a southern border wall too many american parasites flooding in for the free handouts they fly in from africa then cross illegally into quebec you should do a story on it americans think they have a problem on their southern border take a look and see whats flooding into canada from the american side
go vegan 
to people saying my euro ancestors came here legally reality update it has always been easy for white people to come here always im greek there are tons of greeks here illegally ice never looks for them they never get deported this is america immigration is not an issue if youre white
what an idiot  that is a answer you would expect from a pot smoking 6th grader thats how stupid he sounded
rfid chips for everyone support your local new world order
make them legal so we can tax them i heard call them one of us so we can steal from them but building a wall is the best option for insuring a base line for the safety of the american peoplebuild the wall
an argument for the absence of border controls only works if one doesnt believe that the state should exist at all which given the lefts obsession with fabian socialism is something of an oxymoron the left are statists who do not believe that the state should have the right to exercise its primary functions this is a contradiction i still cannot wrap my mind aroundthe belief in open borders and and the cradletograve welfare state the doublethink is up to 11
my brain omg my brain hurts
in my opinion i believe since canadaamericamexico are connected should be one huge country but since mexico and south america is connected they should add that also to one country but there would be a problem with people moving freely across country if they did do that to add to that if there is a wall or no wall drugscrime and people will find away and most drug movements are backed by the us government because it is a trillion dollar business
xray lets pump people full of radiation awesome
we need to build an xray wall
good ideas for two year old
correct me if im wrong but doesnt the united states constitution say that everyone has the right to come here it doesnt say anything about having to go through checkpoints or anything so border patrol the wall or anything of that nature is unconstitutional correct dont get me wrong i know and see the facts that these illegal immigrants are committing a good portion of the murders in america and something needs to be done about it but if your concern is for the families of the people that got murdered and for the people themselves and not a racist issue then if we get rid of the immigrants that knocks the murder according to was crowder was saying i havent seen it myself down 37 nice good start now if you wanna knock that down another approx 51 get rid of the blacks despite being approx 16 of the population the commit approx 51 of the violent crimes in america ok done there now do you want to save another 12001500 american lives every year then deport or destroy the police department but no one will care about these last two facts here because either a lot are black or everyone is taught cops are good and there to protect you again dont get me wrong im friends with some black people really cool guys i know not all blacks murder or commit crimes and i know that not all cops are bad people just the same as not all immigrants murder or anything like that the only sure fire way to stop all this nonsense is for america to put god back in our government and school and everywhere and everyone take responsibility for yourselves and help and love your neighborstudy the law and constitution and know your rights know that what the government teaches now is not right we are not their slaves to pay for their debts the government went bankrupt at least twice and have created birth certificates and ssn to control us and collect taxes to pay for their agendas and debts and wars study the truth people and open your eyes before we lose 100 of our rights with this next generation eat tide pods and crap like that itll be so easy for the government to take it all away god bless everyone
i like to put these on at night to fall asleep just hearing the libtards that come up and give flawed arguments about this stuff puts me to sleep
racism isnt real change my mind
not sure if hell be a good governor
i want some of what this guy brought across the border
borders will always be therefree travel is a libtard lie
theres a crtv commercial before the show this is awesome 
bruh xray border sounds lit
im super dumb but really hope you dont notice
no one loves the sound of leroys voice as much as leroy does
mr president dont wait on the dimwitted democrats just get our troops home and on the borders and turn the corp of engineers loose and let them build the wall
i thought that guy with the backpack was going to be at least moderately intelligent
this was a great idea for a topic but i wish u got more conversations
it sucks that no one with a brain sat down for this one id been waiting for it
wow just wow
it says a lot when crowder doesnt even have to say shit in the end for us to get exactly what hes thinking
i wish steven would have asked the 2nd guy since hes for open borders if he thinks itd be just fine if 1020 million americans decided to move to mexico
steven have you ever read the comments section of strange animal videos on youtube gowan should owe you money
these were all really low iq people who werent capable of feilding your arguments
now thats your dumb build the wall are you effing serious most immigrants come on planes
by far that nonspaniard spanish but 100 aztec was the stupidest guest speaker on your show stupider that all those feminist one billion gender bitches
well i guess we need an xray wall
hispanic guy just did a gram of coke and probably had a back pack full lol
waitso dude would rather us exploit illegals by making money off of the  then send them home and keep them out exploitation  resentment
donald trump mexicans dont send their best theyre criminals theyre rapists  steven donald trump doesnt think mexicans are criminals
some kind of xray border lol this is my favorite change my mind
leroy needs to cut back on the coffee jesus
given that most of the problem with illegal immigration comes from visa overstays and asylum seekers who dont leave when their bogus claims are rejected i am not sure a wall is going to help   the wall is just going to be a massive spending project with little benefit
het was thinking about it more then 3 yrs sure didnt get far with his ideas 
please do an episode about veganism
this video needs to be much longerand with far more intelligent people even if they are wrong i wanted to claw my face off while watching this video
i think you may need to attempt this one again maybe try a sit down in front of a state building and get someone that actually has some skin in the game with government  policies
im not english but my family has been here for hundreds of years
taxes only benefit the government and no one else 
calling your audience cheap pricks because they dont have the funds to get support you at the time is not a wise move
like maybe like we have a free flowing xray border like id need to talk to my hombre and what we need is a chip yeah a chip like that monitors us all like a constant monitor on us all like yeah like a huge eye on a tower stupid leyroy
i cant tell if leroy was just really really stupid high or actually wants a big brother like government watching everyones movement
funny how people agree about controlling immigration but they dont want to admit that we do need the wall to control it you need to funnel and have a checkpoint to have control
the second guy reminds me of that eric dyson fella or that kid who got owned by dinesh dsouza
1st lady is a liershe wants them all out to
oh good we have the typical mexican guy who claims hes not from mexico but is spanish descent who has not idea what the hell hes talking about and thinks there will be no borders in five to ten eyars and there shouldnt be any yes lets turn america into another third world country by letting every single scumbag criminal or drug dealer or human trafficker just walk across the border by the millions he wants to tax people who probably wont be working or will be working under the table or he wants to tag them electronically as he says he doesnt know the scientifical word for it cocaine is a great drug isnt it zippy lol crowder couldnt get one single white  american citizen brave enough to debate on this subject why am i not surprised by that
leroy is retarded get em mar get em mar into the system does he believe marriage will save immigrants wtf
the second guy has no idea what hes talking about
legal mexicans cause all the problems  illegal mexicans are just cheap labor
come to uri when the year starts up
the second guy was an idiot change my mind
theres literally no need to build a wall there is already a fence going all over the border which ppl cant get overu wanna tighten up border control tighten up border control
physical wall pshh xray wall obviouslythis after thinking about the topic for 3 years lmao
technology is going to speed up illegal immigration and make barriers a thing of the pastthis guy watches too much star trektransporters arent real bro
i say we build a force feild walls are a thing of the past
the second guy tries to speak so fast and has no idea what he is saying he needs to think through his ideas realize they make right there next to no sense and come up with come good ideas
so he wants to tag border crossers and release them into the wild like bears being tracked by the dnr im thinking this is a horrible idea
so he wants a digital wall instead of a physical wall
i died at that zoom at the end
build the wall americans want it
just say no to drugs and get your mom to hand write you a note for the border  dear border patrol please allow leroy to gross the border for some of heisenbergs meth
not gay jared with a fanny pack in the back
its funny how scared people are to really have a conversation because they are afraid of facts so they yell at you thats really immature
ummmmm 1 xrays proceed in a straight line and the border isnt straight2 xrays are cancerous over long exposures3 it is more expensive to constantly keep pumping xrays along the border than laying down concrete4 a simple lead wall that is 6 by 4 would be enough to defeat this system5 mexicans wanted free stuff so they got mexico if they could come and go as they please and be citizens there is nothing stopping them from making america mexico6 borders are great they made states that are prosperous like arizona and texas right next to shit holes like california and mexico
build the wall  offer fast tracked and 75 off the price of citizenship for 1 yr and increase ice crackdowns at the same time
that lady dropped a dime on everyone on her building
should need verification of education before you can vote
i feel like that wall wouldnt help benefit at all so why build it im really curious as to how it would stop the illegal aliens from entering statistics most illegal immigrant come to the us legally through a visa and simply overstay it which is the reason for the huge amount of illegal aliens so i dont see how a wall is gonna stop any of this intimation maybe idk just really interested in this topic  ps not trolling really just want to better understand this topic
make illegal citizens legal  what a concept also sir  im not mexican im spanish but weve been living in mexico since 1550  how far are you going back
he dont understand what he described is illegal cause tracking everybody is called spying so he want more surveillance
borders are going to be a thing of the past in 510 years ive heard everything now hahahahah
bruh the canadian government laws in immigration are 10 times more stricter than the us we may not have a physical wall but trust me we dont let a lot of people in
leroy is a perfect example of why i dont like santa fe nm too many of those people are not grounded in reality im in albuquerque nm
im not mexican just my family has lived there for 500 years  lol
we dont need a border but we need a border like an invisible border
so blacks commit 50 of the murders in the us verifiable fact and according to crowder illegal immigrants commit 37 of the rest of the murders lol where does he gets his data since his socialist change my mind debate with the kid who he lost and bullied he has lost a lot of credibilityill stick with my man ben shapiro 
is the second guy high talking about implanting shit into people so the man can locate whenever wherever they want haha
build the wall with your assbitch lol
lets tag em and they will all just quit sending all thier money out of the country  yea that will work this guy watches way to much black mirror
yeah everyone does crimes ya know what kind of argument is that lol
the second guy was microwaved as a baby
this dude is soooooo hard to listen to the intellectual inconsistency and poor grammarspeech construction is like nails on a chalk board
ich bin ein berlinercrowder totalitarians with a deep trust in government love the idea of human corrals
this is not united states this is land of moors of north americayou stupid idiots are nothing more then corporate fictions lol build a wall  dumbfuk get a nationality first rather then corporate statues hahahahaha may jesus sword tongues eat you all hahahahahaha
100 against illegal immigration from anywhere  100 against the wall  just because walls separate people it might make it worse then it is  also some of the money we would spend on it could be spent elsewhere like better equipment for border control or more people  you can climb over or  dig under or breach it  there is also the water crossing sure its a small percentage now but with a wall people will try other means  a wall is a waste of money and not very effective  fencing is better  is cheaper and easier to maintain  all you need is a barrier to slow people down  you cant stop them with a wall you will need more people and better equipment
while we live in 2018 that guy lives in 2048 xray borders
that guy has no idea what he is talking about
im spanish not mexican my family has been in mexico since the 1500s wtf  with that logic every human on earth is actually african
white countries ought to stay white
the second guy is a fucking moron 
this radio show guy cant change my mind hes not very bright
i say that things need to be taken to the next level you can go ahead and build the wall but it wont do any good unless you militarize the wall i guarantee that if you militarize the border  wall this will immediately curb or even stop illegal immigration in its tracks install sentry towers plant mines razor wire etc
why call it  change my mind when your mind is already made up
the 2nd guy is really really dumb they dont have any documentation
leroy is  an idiot sorry
this is a freethought so a need a few mastermind individuals for my xray border
wtf
it seems to me even the citizens cant speak english
heads up crowser the first lady you had her face blurred but her id badge was not great video but man that second guy imagine tagging people that came over people would flip shit it is like nazi germany marking jews
2nd guy was crazy but atleast he has some cool ideas maybe he will one day become more sane and start a cool business maybe
all i can say is god help new mexico lol that guy was out there
lol im a cheap prick free loader  hm that is a nice mug though
do you even xray bro
i agree with most of your change my mind videos but i dont believe in building a wall  most illegal immigrants dont literally hop over the wall  i do believe in stricter immigrant reform however our efforts should be focused on preventing things like tunnel networks higher border security etc
dont build a wall build an international catalog of every person ever and give them an etag so that when they walk through our massive xray gate spanning the entire border they are tested by the us government asking why they are there and bam citizenship
leroy 2020
i dont think the second guy knew what words were coming out the first woman that was sad
that xray guy is one hell of a stupid mess x
wtf is go green global
1 building the wall is a waste of moneyresources2 if we wanted to get rid of illegal immigrants all you had to do is go after employers landlords and banks 3 sanctuary cities are not stopping criminal illegals from being deported
at some point the walls will also act as a prison
2nd guy  the retard is strong in this one omfg this is what the youth has become in this countryits actually funny how he is trying to show how smart he is while speaking like a true autist
im not mexican im spanish hah
the wall wont do anything lets be honest walls can be climbed dug under destroyed take boats around into california and then spread out like people have been doing its a waste of money and not the correct method of stopping illegal immigration if they couldnt work here theyd stop coming in china to get a hotel room you need a passport with a valid visa you need to notify local police stations you are living in an area if you are on a visa we need to enforce the laws we have already
i love your shirt
wow that guy from nm is hard to listen to
omg second guy has no idea what hes talking about just full of caffeine
he gave a free thought did he charge for the others
the second guys is retarded  how are you going to give these people an identification number when they want to get into the country unnoticed  maybe theyll use a fake number but not anything that will have their real identification information
that look at the end  i just cant 
this guy made my head hurt
somebody please give this guy a copy of 1984
i dont understand why these people think its ok to break the law
the guy recording for his show was he high  lol and xray boarder
that spanish guy is a fucking retard fuuuuuck what a dumb cunt
the xray border is 0retty dumb but an physical wall is quite inneficientmake a wall protected by drone andor turrets if you pass a certain line it kills indiscriminatlywould fix the issue pretty damn quickmake only few passage point being unguarded by those droneturrets and make sure everyone going in is legally autorized to
the wage gap is fake
the guy would be all for the rfid chip thats scary
we shouldnt build a wall we should build an xray wall
the second guy smh
hes an idiot trying to sound smart
i really dont understand how someone that have been in the us for years cannot speak proper english im eastern european and i never set foot in an english speaking country but i can still speak fluent english
the second dude is literally crazyxrays that scan people and he wants to be governor lol
that second guy basically decribed the dystopian future of minority report i was just waiting for him to suggest a system to predict crimes before they happened
eating animals is okay change my mind
build the wall
950 he propose us goverment to chip the citizen and verified their id with every business they doopen bordertotal surveillance thats grreat idea you want enter then you must enter the collective
why do those of you who dont want to wall why have you chosen to force the taxpayer to pay for everything including these people who come here sit on welfare granted we have our own number people on welfare but they come here they sit on welfare and then talk s and hate our country and youre okay with this im not okay with paying for people to be in prison for their entire life im not okay with paying for people to come here and be on welfare and get free schooling on our dime i cant even send my kid to college but my taxes keep going up
the second guywow people come here illegally and somehow he thinks we can tag them so they can be identified how exactly do we tag them if they are coming here secretly also the idea of tagging people is just too reminiscent of nazi germany to me lets just keep as many of them out as possible and let people come here through legal channels k people like this dude i think disagree with controlling the border simply because conservatives believe in it
okay second guy how are we supposed to tax illegals when they sneak into the country illegally  for someone who might be hosting their own showchannel you sure dont seem to know the first thing about what youre talking about
that mexican guy is a moron 3 of the population is committing 37 of the crimes well everybody commits crime ya know what i mean yea your people committing crime isnt a problem in your mind is what you mean everybody commits crime the conversation is over dude
the 2nd guy  hands down thought he was about to own that interviewhe definitely deleted his footage god bless him
that second guy how do you get people to go through the xray gate idea if it is only at a few points across the border making it the full length would be more expensive than a wall his point defeats itself
the second guy was pretty much for the wall and doesnt even realise it haha
go go gadget xray borders 
the second guy sucks lol
at 1000 into this and im pretty sure i just heard mastermind individuals blatant answer and scientifical all within one glorious answer to why we dont need a wall
facial recognition technology dna tags
you needa go to a school
did he say indevegetables
um wat
so the second guy was on something change my mind
this is why the left is so violent  if they try to debate using facts their brains just melt
i have no words to describe that second guy that dude has an iq of a potato
it wasnt as hostile as some of the other ones but the last guy had ideas that would only work if we had an effective way to funnel potential illegals to follow a policy they are actively trying to avoid
man i tought that brazilians my people were stupid but damn i can see that the comon american can acctuly beat us  i am realy ssurprised rn
give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free the wretched refuse of your teeming shore and i will build a wall and separate your family and take your children hostage so you can learn your lesson truth is stranger than fiction no kid deserves to go through the in inhumane act of being separated from their parents and a wall will just make drug lords richer because i do not see a demand for narcotics going down any time soon americans love their drugs so much that their in our antidepressant commercials i pray that the kids going through this find strength and enlightenment because this is a great country and not every american is probuilding a wall love your neighbor as they have delicious beer and tacos and great parties with chips and salsa  everyone have a good week from a first generation mexicanamerican who is fed up about hearing how bad my people are when americans create wars in the name of ehm oil and justify it by putting christ and salvation behind it  i love how statistics can easily justify inhumane acts why does a white rapists differ from a illegal mexican rapists are they not the same unimaginable crime media is putting a stain on our beautiful culture that brightens up american lives and produces good labor from our hard working educated people we all share the same moon sun and stars come on people there are way better solutions than this
hell be a scientifical governor
that dude is a freakin idiot he has no idea what he is talking about and no idea of facts scientypical really
some people are just retarded
im so happy to have multiple change my minds so close
hold on a second what wars did the us start in mexico by wanting to build a wall  what is this woman talking about
hes literally explaining a wall but he doesnt want a wall like
that guy wants the us to function like one of amazons cashierless stores
hahahah becoming the governor of new mexico dude you have the iq of a squirrel
i wish i couldve went and changed your mind on the wall so far im on the second interview and it makes me sad
electronic taglike the mark of the beast
why dont we just build a tower that shoots micro chips into peoples brains then an xray scanner scans the people and sends their dna to a database that then checks how many percent american that person is and if its above 314 they get to go in but if its under they get shot by another chip and that chip controles their brain to make them walk away from the boarders but shut off whenever they are more than 10m away from the boardersjesus is that so hard
 im sure that body scannar with a database of every immigrant that can scan a 1900 mile border technology is coming right up soon
all the stuff that last guy talks about is at the border so he doesnt want borders but he still wants portsofentry on the borders
that guy needs to stop smoking drugs
they dont know what they are talking about they want security but no wall is al wall around your house not security you protect your house with a wall and door too keep people that dont belong there out or make it difficult for them to get in why not protect your country like that too you are already doing it
mr leeroy what youve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard at no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul
a lot of illegal aliens trying to invade are drug dealers and human traffickers but there are poor families trying to flee mexico as well which should get the opportunity to live a better life in the states i also believe if you are so against creating a barrier for these families trying to enter maybe you should setup an organization to assist families in mexico to get in legally also rip xxxtension cord
wow this guy is unreal and xray scanner and a note from mum instead of a wall 
did that guy just say immigrants should pay extra taxes
wait till every body sees the waste of money this wall is gonna be when my raza is still coming through viva mexico
i love looking at how many dislikes there are and im usually think there just sitting there on welfare waiting for another right wing video just to dislike it
i hate to play the devils advocate but if you believe the 2 amendment was put here to keep a tyrannical govt at bay then its not a stretch to believe the wall may have a more sinister motive walls can be used to keep people in as well as out the berlin wall comes to mind
this hispanic dude is beyond retarded
build the wall with your ass bitch anonymous 2018
stupid stupid stupid how can he just ignore the crimerate and say that borders should be removed thats sooo stupid
xray border 
first lady no nonooooowe need more lemon pledge
did the last guy say  to treat people like dogs tag them with a chips so we can located them lol shit
why do you guys want a wall though it would literally be a detriment to your society
last time someone was tagged as identification like that was concentration camps
lol spanish millenial dosnt want a wall but is ok with  erecting fucking skynet to track illegals maybe we should elect him president next and just dial up the police state to 11why stop there how about we do a illegals for iphones  program  uncle sam gives you a free shiny obama phone for every illegal you drop off at a detention center lolits not like american money means anything anymore anywayson a tentwtially related note why the fuck are we ad hitting around waiting for chester cheeto and old fucking do nothing beurocrats to cough up cash for wall anyways are we americans or americnntsif we want a wall why dont we just get the land under imminent domainsand pass the hat around and actually donate our time and energy and build the fucking thing ourselves it would prolly get done faster and cheaper if we did it that way and it would be good ego boost and branding for the country and political factions involved and people that dont want the wall dont have as much room to pass and mean because little to no tax dollars going into itsure we might not get the whole thing done or perfect with this method but it would make the wall about more then just illegals the volenter wall could be us getting backtoourrootw and reclaimingamericas destiny and all that red white and blue warm fuzzy shit also charity projects never get means tested for efficacy either also might be a good way to get these lazy uslelles millenials employed teach them some actual trades like heavy equipment operation welding masonry shut like that while on projectthat my friends is an easy ducking selk to the american people and congress then see how that plays out start on highest traffic areas first chain link and drone lowest traffic areas and go back to congress down the road if we have budget shortfalls and need some help and if you really wanna get fancy gwy arpu to hall some of his guys over to help dig and such seems fitting that illegals would have to help build the wall also and that shit would drive libtards to suicide im sure it even better make them buts enough to cometey blowing up the wall the they get arrested and raped in prison by the very same people they are cheerleading fornow matter how you slice this thing its winning
my mind cant be chaged  change my mind
build the wall with ur ass bitch omg replayed that 10x does mexicos big ass fucking wall with guatemala make you mad angry and wanna cry
blast them with x rays until we identify them lol lefties are soooooooooo fucking stupid
where did you find this guy he knows nothing
im gonna be the governor of new mexico bahahbahabahaha
so a wall isnt good enough for him he wants a much stronger border than that some scifi kinda stuff
i could be in favor of a much much higher powered xray wall for vaporization but either seems more costly than concrete
pubg figure
i worked back in the 1980s as a landscaper for a few years  during the years i worked in this business almost every mexican i had the pleasure to work with did not want to become a american they saved there money to spend back home  so i dont quite get this idea that all these law breaking people want to integrate into american society for the most part they dont
isnt those people passing by and cursing him a hate crime by the way which means they should face jail time
what is that guy on
so a giant xray scanner hmmm smh
trump can pay for the wall by renting it out as a shooting range
hes not spabish
an xray gate that reads your id  man id love to know what was going through crowders head when he was hearing that incoherent line of babble
crowders look at the end is like what the f was that guy talking about
a spaniard named leroy who talks like a down syndrome canadian now iv seen it all
i noticed you were not able to present anyone with intellectual discussion that appose the wall i wonder why
cheap prick here  love the content keep it up 
that guys accent was driving me crazy drugsuh yesuh
typical new mexico moron
lefties are nuggets
um its not much of a debate when youre only debating people with an iq less than 90
yeahtax the people you know with all that money they bring over
that guy was a real weirdo and had no idea what he was talking about but at least he was respectful
just build the wall already ffs mexico built one already who the fuck cares but illegal rats anyways
in the end its just nanomachines
or somdink like a computer technician hahaha
if that guy becomes governor of new mexico ill easily slide into the position of highest scientificilogical mastermined guy
that kid is dumb as duck
xray scanner sounds expensive
interesting how mr drugsa made a distinction between himself as spanish from mexico and mexicanwonder why that is
mexico is a failed narco statethe mexican people need to stand up and cause change to happen
jeez lady get a fresh bottle of water the one you have is so old that weeds have grown out of it
dude sometimes youre too nice
bahahaha this guy got two hispanic dumb shits who sat down they sound fucking stupid and make me embarrassed how dumb they sound they made it worst for our cause lol
wtf
man that guy with the backpack is an idiot
it would have been interesting to see if steven crowder actually supported the building of trumps physical wall or is just arguing that the usa needs border security at the current time there is border enforcement without trumps wall with checkpoints to determine who is allowed to enter into the usa trumps wall is silly because it is not cost effective the reality of its effectiveness to stop illegal immigration would come down to ultimately how many border protection officers are employed not just at the border but at all points of entry to the usa and how well they are resourced and trained which is the same situation without the wall
face  palm
leroy speaks perfect gibberish
all the negative things were also truthfully said of the irish  im sure glad grandma was allowed here
lol the second guy was everywhere
how hard is it to understand how borders work do you hop your neighbours fence and use their bbq when they arent home
you should have blocked the lady better
wash that guy on meth
the drugsa
1025xrayyeah what that guy meant by few mastermind individuals he no doubt unconsciously was referring to people who are smarter than him to figure out how to fix everything and pretty much makedecisionsfor him and likeminded individuals otherwise the more likely device would be an rfid worn or carried in the wallet or purse like an id by legal immigrants because an illegal immigrant is least likely to enter a government facility for this who can conveniently go in and out of facilities also back and forth over the border quite easily itd be very easy to determine who is and isnt legal read with rfidlegal or without rfidillegal why stop there the same thing could be applied to various other regions of the general population to regulate crime and citizenry because if done through the appropriate channels the rfid would be difficult to counterfeit of course such a sensible and rational thing would never actually occurwhat with the belief in such silly nonsense like the mark of the beast and end times profitsy which will obviously occur soon and not like some far off thousandsofyearsfromnow nonsensemaking it that much easier to talk aboutand trace any indirect influence directly back to this comment
i dont think that guy is scientifical enough to be governor
x ray scanner
how did you stay so patient and respectful of the mastermind xray dude   lmfao
our open borders idea guy proposes a police state im shocked shocked i tell you
i support building the wall securing our borders especially the southern border as it is violated more than the northern one welfare reform would only effect a percentage of those enticed to cone here so we have to enforce the laws we have and make them stronger end chain immigration no citizen should just call out to family members to immigrate here let the member aply on their own merit if you attack the means of existing here it would discourage them further being here illegal if you are here illegal you have no right except basic human rights which the united nations failed at enforcing but if you commit a violent crime here you are forfeit
oh so thats what he does when he knows hes wrong he says i need you to change my mind and dismisses them on other videos he would spend almost an hour talking to one person then dismisses them hes only doing here for entertainment and theres no need to take him seriously anymore
he needs a scientifical mastermind individual to freeflow a tagged xray border
love the anime adds before the vid starts
of course his name was go green global hahahaha xd
1318 crowders more shook than leftists on election night shit
the wall itself isnt bad but how the fuck do you finance it 
im not sure how long these take you to prepare and everything but i think this content style change my mind is your biggest attraction make a shit tone more
so  he is saying we should tag people as if they are migrating animals did i understand that right
change my mind is ded
i dont believe this interviewdebate is fake but this guy is so out of his mind that it looks fake first saying he is against border than suggesting borders is crazy in this day and age with so much access to information someone like that speaks out of his ass saying that is against everything without knowing any fact and not proposing solutions really makes me sad  by the way i dont agree with the wall itself but using the money that would go for it to more background checks and more qualified enforces around the border would be a good start
hungary built a wall in 2015 and its actually worked for them
1055an xray like a proper scientifical ray thats used but i like a gate free flowingmove along people nothing to see here
the dude in the white shirt is a dumbass sounds like english is his second language
1035 so basically he described a digital wall
bunch of fucking nut jobs in this one lmao start micro chipping illegals like some exodus shit
for everyone claiming that the border wall is too expensive the proposed cost of the border wall is 22 billion dollars there are 122 million tax paying americans if you do the math that comes out to 181 per taxpayer its kind of a moot point
love to see your binder full of stats and sources
an xray scanneri guess it could be possible a couple years or more from now
so instead of a wall this guy suggests to round up illegals microchip them and track themhmmm sounds much like a certain vile dictator we went to war against back in the 40s
xray border im voting for him
i believe the wall is excessive border patrol does good enough of a job and it would just cost too much money in the long run to maintain the wall
i one day plan on being the governor of new mexico hombre here was definitely on some of that crack were talking about
pee is stored in the balls change my mind
okay guy in the white tshirt leroy what you been smoking dude
the second guy literally contradicted himself over and over again he gave me a headache
stevencrowder for the gentleman that came to you saying that he doesnt believe in a border if he wants to be a governor  how will he be the governor of nm if there are no borders how will there be a new mexico but thats just tongue and cheek my real contention to his view comes from the fact that you think that these illegals will circulate money into the economywhen in fact ive worked three jobs in the last 3 years with illegals here in texas every last one if them thats about 15 individual employees had family in their home country who they would send 75 to 80 percent of their check too they were making around 2k bi weekly so in fact majority of the  money we send to these people they send to their home country and their home counties economy is being boosted while we go further into debtnot to mention the discrimination americans are receiving because we wont work as cheap as the illegals wouldand we need things like benefits dental health care that ultimately gets niched because an illegal could care less for work benefitsalso at every one of these jobs inculdingbthe one i work in nowall of these people are paid full checks in cash while americans are paid in tax deductible checksi could go on and on because i personally first hand work with illegalsthey arent bad people they just dont see how they are causing major problems for hardworking americans that want to work a job in which they dont need google translate to speak with upper management
that guy is an idiot
governor of new mexico haha
omfg how irritating is the self identified spanish dude who walked in  408  what a fucking moron
the discussion with that 1 guy was not a change my mind segments it was a cringe my mind segment
i always hear the low iq reasoning that the illegal immigrants will just add to the economy through taxation and their spending if the people coming here are all such a benefit to the economy then why are their home countries not thriving also are we then guilty of stealing the valuable people from these less fortunate countries so we need to build the wall to keep america from plundering the population of our oppressed neighbors
406 meth head
thats the new american dumb shit
seems crowder again chose a bias to suit his beliefno way that second guy was worth showing and that no one else that day had  a good pointonly 14 minutes so clearly chose the easiest and stupidest people
this guy didnt want to grant crowder his point so badly that he developed a fucking xray wall
the migration and stuff
why why did you talk to that idiot so long
build the xray microchip wall with excuse notes  change my mind
what surprised me most the fact you let this space cadet have so much of the mic time
jesus christ people are uneducated twits the future is in big trouble
build the wall already
what kind of drugs is white shirt guy on
that is the dumbest idea ever this young man has
john oliver fucke the build the wall argument
its funny how these people defend illegal immigrants like they didnt mean to just cross a fucking border illegally and enter the greatest country in the world
i was mainly surprised that the future governor of new mexico said that he wasnt able to describe the how the xray border would work he seemed like a really smart guy and stuff like xray borders are simple  4th grade level material
i wouldnt say unedited unscripted sure its edited to be only a little over ten minutes
blurring that womans face may not be good enough her clothes body type heck even the plant might identify her btw the wall is impracticable but the thoughts behind it are understandable
this spanish guy wants to create george orwells 1984 scanners to pinpoint your exact location wherever you go not like big brother isnt already watching us with our phones
the iq level of these people critical thinking doesnt exist should have to have a standard iq level to vote
that 2nd guy needs to get off of the meth its fucking him up
where do you plug the scanners in san juan so you can spend money at sections of the boarder to build a checkpoint center without gates fences and security im guessing his home is ripe with people stealing his stuff
if you build a wall will it not keep the honest people out of america and only the criminals will make it over if you build a wall the criminals will find a way around it just a thought
that 4th wall look from crowder at the end hilarious and classic
what an idiot how do you keep your composure steven
this is painful to watch i really wish he had people who were experts in the costbenefit of it what problems could occur when building over mountains and rivers what a realistic wall would entail and how long it would take how effective it would be for stopping illegal boarder crossings how will it impact land owners along the border and if they will have to give up land to the gov in order to build it this just seems like a horrible waste of time its like a second grader trying to convince someone vegetables are yucky
1315 yesss lmfao same
really hes proposing for people to get the mark of the beast and get it scanned via xray scanning
i one day plan on being the governor of new mexico
future governor of new mexico eh id say hes got a pretty good shot at it  the leftist criteria for leadership being what it is today
ive got a feeling that people who are against the wall dont know that a wall can have gates or doors someone should really tell them that a wall doesnt mean complete seperation
my families been in mexico since 1500but im not mexicanim spanish   baaaaaaaahahahahaaaaa
build the wall with your ass bitch this is why you cant argue or reason with these people  they are grown up babies with adolescent minds who dont think rationally and act on impulse and emotion
the first lady thinks the wall wouldnt work but i think it would definitely reduce the amount of illegals entering the country
nice crowda 423
everything that guy said is for a wall but for some reason the physical wall is a problem
i dont think we should have boarders so people can move freely but i do think we should chip everyone then use xray machines across the country that track everyones movements like cattle the left achieving freedom for some by enslaving all
i have my dogs wearing collars with an invisible fence around my yard why not treat everyone like dogs
im spanish 
we can tax the illegal immigrants really uh oh  retard alert
you know  all these issuesconcerns will be solved in 2020
do you know where her gets his statistics i wanna see them for myself
an xray border that reads your tag im ded
you cant have mass immigration and a welfare state
second guy was a plant right oh god
im from denmark so if i wanna live in the us i have to apply for a visa etc etc and i will be scanned if im a criminal or not or else i will be stopped at the airport makes sense i should not get access if im a gang member etc why should it be any different at the boarder the wall will work the same as the secured airport i find it funny that many left people call us white people privileged but i still must follow the laws but illegal immigrants thinks they dont have to so the question is who is really the entitled one and if i must apply for visa green card etc etc to live in the us and follow the laws of the country then why is it too much to ask illegal immigrants do the same just because they come from a poor state does that entitle them to bend or avoid the law of the country they are moving to in my book applying for citizenship is the civilized way to do it and it makes it easier for countries to sort the bad apples from the good but i guess im a racist for even thinking this according to the left let me just ask this when you leave your home when you go to work do you lock your door and why in order to prevent unwanted criminals from breaking in and robbing your house ofc kinda the same with boarders sure even when locked people can break in but it is hell of a lot harder than if the door was just open
the last guy was a literal retard
how do you collect taxes if they have no job   and have no sin
freeloader cheap pick here thanks for the content keep it coming i dont always agree but thats 13 the reason i watch
the second person is such a stupid 
sorry to say but if you blurred first ladys face for safety why didnt you blur her name badge delete this is you want
so according to the second guy we should have open borders that just let everyone in while at the same time having border security sure 
its simple logic if you build wall illegals wont cross over no onewill well be detained and separated from family clearly if you leave it to those unfit patents to look after the welfare of their own kids theywill break the law and endanger them
lol the 2nd guy is literally retarded hes probably a teacher
i love these crowder videos but this one was painful to watch that spanish guy whos family has been in new mexico since the 1550s is a fucking retard my god my head hurt just from listening to him babble
x ray gate get on it trump
cant stand hearing that retard talk
wow that guy was a total psuedo intellectual
i almost couldnt make it through this the stupidity is out of control
second dude trying to hard to be intelligent
people will be able to travel far and cheap wherever with no borders in the next 5 to 10 years i love how young people are so optimistic and silly when it comes to the immediate future talk to that guy in 10 years and hes actually supporting tags on people like dogs lol incredible
mr madison what youve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard at no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul
says walls and borders are a thing of the past  wants to build a wall with id tag and xray scanners
bro was talking out the side of his neck
this is the most awkward video you guys have made xrays just shoot people with xrays problem solvedand that poor lady felt so bad for her she seems like a sweet lady
2 million subs  celebrate that victory
2 million subs  celebrate that victory
lets build a radioactive cancer fence
could have done without that last interview
it is easy to find follow and statistically track all immigrants give them phones that is how you are tracked
fu dude noone else sat down what is this i was excited for this one eh
is that guy on drugs
theres no wall  that was a 10 cent slogan that dipshits fell for
as nonamerican i believe immigration policies to the us should be rigorous wall isnt amust but it will help the illegal immigration problems i researched about issues that illegal immigrants cause lowwage jobs stealing jobs  quotation marks even though it sounds delusional its real safety demographic changes etceven though the us could actually profit from increasing immigration in numbers it would be hard for the economy to improve that significantly to support all those peoples needs in health safety job availabilitytrump has idiotic ideas most of the time but hes right about some this is one of those good ones
governor of new mexico xd
all the cowardly antifa pigs shouting from cars ahahaha
i want some of what ever he smoked 
oh crap this guy wants a chip 
oh man i gotta know what this guys show is about lmao
borders a thing of the pasta
that second is sure not that bright
i love these change my mind segments you really need to do more of these any and all topics please and thank you
my family has been here since about 1620 at what point am i considered a native how many hundreds of years does it take
i need to talk to a group of intelligent people before i can answer your question coherently hahaha maybe just make that a general life goal for yourself
lord liberals are so stupid they just live in an imaginary world
heres a thought if people believe in no borders do they support the us taking over mexico and replacing their leadership with american policies
idiots
is nobody gonna mention this dudes speech quirk lol who are the ones selling the drugsuh just like technology everything speeds uppuh i think borders are gonna become a thing of the pastuh people are just gonna be able to travel super fastuh lol
add to trigger word list wall build the also no more red ink
did that very uneloquent young lad just advocate for rfid chips what the actual fuck
mexicans have average iq of 40 they cant put together 2 things literally
450 lmaffo bullshit
like get some masterminds like together and maybe like get some computer science guys to make a scientifical  xray border
how is this guy going to be the govenor of new mexico yet he does not know  you can not track an illegal immigrant and tax them and that is what the wall will be for to help prevent illegal immigrants getting in the country and making them have to come in legally
its funny that the guy who wants open borders wants to chip people and make it so the government knows where you are all the time
leroy was like finger nails on a chalkboard for thinking about this a lot he still seems to be trying to put together a single coherent thought
that second dude was on the drugzuh i thinkuh
absolute retard
the guy from spain is beyond clueless
when can this book you talked about in previous episodes be boughthow do i buy it you talked about it in socialism is evil
what if swathes of americans just decided to cross over into mexico and settle without appropriate residency application  would the mexican government tolerate it
what hes suggesting is a lot more complicated than building a wall and hes also implying he need people smarter than him to implement his own idea
vegans change my mind i really want to see this topic play out
my great uncle jimmy came over from greece married my great aunt karen and became legal through marriage and still spent the time to get his green card and take the tests and stuff i was like 9 at the time so its kinda fuzzy on details but he didnt want to be here just for marriage he honestly loved this country
tolerant left
you deserve a medal for your capacity of keeping a straight face with that second guy
governor of new mexico eh
looks like you got played by an illegal conman
that guy is a complete idiot some kind of electronic id tag is he suggesting we put microchips inside of all immigrants this is a free thought right now made me cringe pretty hard he makes me want the wall to be 10 feet taller
 the second guy goodnessss bizarre
so we are going to put ear tags on illegals now
her face is visible on her neck tag lol
why do people think that being hard working nice people means its ok for them to illegally enter the country the argument isnt if illegals are nice people
seems like you choose the dumbest people who sit down i thoguht i would hear some real intelligent counter ideas to build a phisical wall like let us say the amount of money needed for the wall and its maintenance is way too high and could be used in other tasks like what ted cruz suggested increasing the amount of juries to process the illigals
searches gogreenglobalgets an old crowder video as top search result
poor misinformed lady
how do you tax people working illegally and how do you tax people living off of welfare you let people in legally with no problems how many would come just to be on welfare look at europe opened their borders and their pockets
hahahaha that guy reads too many comics hilarious
lets not build a wall because thats racist lets put in a xray gate
so tax them when they come in  so you mean the legal way pay for your citizenship and get your social security number and pay taxes lmao
oh my god end of the world if you let that 2nd guy rule it  what about all country let down borders let see the mess
blurr that ladies fucking nametag crowder shes scared of narco terrorists
i was wondering why i was seeing so many skeletons walking around it was all them damn xray people
this segment was not productive probably because the topic is too controversial and it immediately separates people by their tribal political identities
build that fing wall add a catapult  launch them over no parachutes wow some of these people are bat shit crazy
we need an xray wall and mexicos going to pay for our cancer treatments
deport that second guy he probably wouldnt notice  cudos to you crowderyour patience is epic
80 of the heroin in the us comes from mexico httpwwwbusinessinsidercomusheroincomingfrommexicancartels
when trying to sound intellectual goes wrong
that guy the border is already free flowing
yeah a scientifical xray machine sounds great
as far as building a wall goes the future governor is by far one of the most stupid people you could have had a discussion with imagine if he hadnt been thinking about this problem for the last 3 years
it just seems a little silly to spend that much money building a wall when most illegal immigration happens with people coming legally and over staying their visas also a meta analysis of immigrant communities showed lowed crime rates than native populations it took into account vast amounts of studies and data
you know what i find funny the fact that mostly everyone that comes and sits down and talks to you think they know everything and how to do everything  not saying all the ideas they share arent worthless but it is more the fact of everyone should understand the reality about the issues
build the wall
we have the most diverse country in the world and its a beautiful thing and building a wall is something that north korea has done to not allow anyone in or out of the country and its just scary to think that our president wants to do this with mexico even though its just to keep illegals out but who knows if that power can strengthen to become out our control like north korea and already our citizens want stricter gun laws too which essentially gives government more power
save money on the wall by reinstituting slavery for illegal immigrants ill bet that plugs the hole
steven use white duct tape next time

x ray border scanner from a mexican mastermind
i cant believe you fucks believe anything coming out of this guys mouth cant find one single piece of evidence that suggests illegal immigrants commit 30 of homicides in the united states its bullshit to fuel your agenda and its sickeningif youre so concerned about crime amongst illegal immigrants such as drug traffickers and homicides then wouldnt an easy solution be to provide an easier path to citizenship so methods to identify these criminals would be easier
mastermind individuals
dude that is exactly what trump said
so many people clearly dont understand the simple difference between immigrants and illegal immigrantsdo dictionaries no longer carry any value  importance what so ever  do words no longer need meaning im truly amazedif youre there legally you dont have much to fearnot knowing who enters your country can pose serious threats to national security im french and even i know that obviously it should not be a physical wall but more like a wall of watch towers with just fences the cost in labor alone not mentioning materials would be a little too much but some watch towers would do the job
ok let me get right on that leroy
confederate monuments shouldnt be displayed on public property except in a museum change my mind
i like your shoes
leroy is am idiot
okay he clearly has been demowashed
dont do drugs kids
i dont want a wall i just want a freaken border from stones that at least 3 meters high
the public school system at work
yeah radiate everyone 
when it comes down to it build the wall
no wall but lets have an xray wall thingy
people are so use to technology just taking care of everything that they believe it will just magically come out of no where and fix everything dependence on nonexistant apps makes people think if you just think of something it just works just because you say it does
fuck me i loved that mastermind individual comment classic 
no voting power for imergrants that become us citizens
this guys iq score is lower than that tire in the background its like a six year old just sat down with crowder and discussed cool ideas for their backyard game they play
technology catch up to make a 2000 mile long xray machine because he plans to be governor lol
i can normally watch your interviews but this guy was an idiot trying to get his 15 minutes of fame and i couldnt watch it any longer
what a fucking idiot
dont have borders but have electronic id tag on every human being sound logic ha
build a border to track people but dont build a border so people can just go where ever and be free flowing 
what would you say about the agricultural industry that relies on illegal immigrants its struggling to employ people and we all no the population is expected to rise dramatically in the near future
walls a thing of the past  means marxsisme no boarders  no nations  people are stupid really
help keep families together build the wall
i kind of agree with the first lady   im against illegal immigration and im against the wall   i worry the wall may one day be used to keep us in   if we cut off the welfare free healthcare and free education to illegal immigrants im not sure a wall would be needed
707 lol its funny how this guy is thinking of how to deal with the information that 37 of homicides are by illegals u cant deny that fact its a huge problem caused by a very small amount of ppland then lol if only making ppl citizens would benefit the countryhe doesnt see the fact it costs more than the majority will ever pay in taxesthey are using systems already being paid for by other citizens that have not got a return yetand in the case of social security i personally have paid in my whole life but will never receive any benefitsu can easily find information on how many years our country has the ability to pay for certain thingssocial security will be bankrupt in less than 4 yearsyes this has happened before and every time they just band aid the budget with no solution just a few more years outbut living with this type of uncertainty of my own retirement is not healthyand already my parents will be getting less benefits themselves so i will have to help them
sounds like people dont want a border wall but cant think of a suitable replacement
so basically logic doesnt apply whatsoever the liberal mantra we dont need no stinking logic we have lots of feelings and stuff  unbelievable
xray border omg that guy has no clue or idea 
i hope you do another build the wall cmms since the people you spoke with clearly werent knowledgeable enough to discuss this topic seriously though where the heck did you set up shop this time
thanks for another free video steeeeevebig up to all my cheap prick homies out there
this mexican guy you interviewed is fucking autistic
you are soo fucking stupid but if youre trying to get clicks its a smart strategy just diss major topics to get your audience and act as if you where anything else than a monkey bitch  trying to get paid because he forgot how to survive without paper and lives afraid of all them mexicans coming for his money  paper holding fake value just like bitcoin this was as retarded as arguing if banning alcohol will stop car accidents its the fucking cars oh but dont nobody dare talk shit about cars     
you report them to ice
that guy is delusional
people we live within walls with a checkpoint at the front we call it our house  your house has walls enclosed around it and a door for entering and exiting  tell me how will you keep your house and the valuables within it if you lost your walls and doorswhy are people putting feelings above reasoning  this will only bring destruction and your feelings will turn from happy and laughter to sadness and tears
all border walls are evil and immoral everyone who wants to come to  america should be allowed in unless violent criminals if they need housing or health care they should be given it by the federal government usa is plenty rich enough and has to much money and power as it is so we can afford it these people are just looking for a better life they deserve to live in america and receive all the government benefits that come with that they should be given food stamps housing healthcare cell phone with internet and access to education these are all human rights and all people should be given them regardless of where they happen to be born its not there fault that they were born in some shitty country in south america so its there right to come to america and be given these things if we have to tax more of the middle class and upper class to pay for all this then thats ok they have to much money as it is these people who need it should have that money go to them in the form of government assistance if they cant work they should also be given a basic income on top of all the other benefits like i said before these are human rights
1100 this dude is so dumb xd
i dont know why the second dude brought up taxesthe illegal immigrants are undocumented that means we cant tax them because we dont know about them
the second guy is missing the point on illegal immigration  if they come over illegally you dont have a record of their entry  you cant offer them citizenship if you dont know who they are  also the leftists desire for open borders and no guns would leave us open to conquest
xray border bahahahahahaha sure no problem im fucking dying
the guy had great ideasand that digital program is on the books to be funded as the line item right under the star wars program
losing me with this one dont build the wall because it cost too much strengthen the fences that are there now also the wall isnt going to stop people from coming over they will just climb the 10 foot wall its useless
yes build a wall 168 billion dollars to baby shit a ton of refugees is fucking retarded
hes talking about rfid chipping everyone so we can track them crazy
the mexican guy would spend more money then obama with his plan
second bloke was a fucking retard
someone slipped their carer he probably needed help getting dressed this morning
emote  face palm
that was painful to watch not because of you crowder but the asinine arguments im for building the wall
an xray border  omg
first woman was a fucking retard
this guy thinks when we tax people tax money is put into the economy  yeah these people go through life completely ignorant of basic things
build the walland the gatormoat
build the whole wall across our entire border even in the mountains and yes give them some type of id number and when they pass through legal points of that border wall scan them and then we will be able to actually tax  them an track them like we do our own citizens i think thats actually really fair what i just proposed because it gives them freedom and protects our border at the same time and lets be honest it wouldnt hurt to have our us military which is supposed to defend the sovereignty of our nation to actually defend our border other countries defend their borders i just dont know why people think its wrong that we defend ours and if they cross illegally we should do the same thing other countries do minimum prison sentences and then after theyre done with their prison sentence deport them yes that would cost us tax dollars to put them in prison but it would be cheaper than what were doing right now by allowing thousands upon thousands of them a month that are crossing to live here in sanctuary cities and speaking of sanctuary cities we should just get rid of those all together frankly its unamerican
something i dont understand is that people think creating infrastructure to allow the usa to control the flow of immigration would somehow make it so that wed decrease the rate of it if we see negative side effects of blocking otherwise illegal immigrants from entering the country then that same infrastructure could double as a bottle neck so that we could properly register and immigrants even if we allow the rate to stay the sameits about having the option and capability
so we want to create a big brother system for illegal immigrants
illegals are criminals that is all
if we have border security they arent coming in  thats what border securoty actually means
stevens face at the end of the interview says it all i plan to one day be the governor of new mexico this comment scares because i know it could happen
at least help the lady out and blur some more to keep her identitiy safe
dude i just dont think we should do it cuz it is expensive lol
hats off to him for not laughing in that guys face it was like one of those commercials where they ask 6 year olds questions simply for the ridiculousness
second guy is on another level llaying that 6d chess staying 5 steps ahead
this guy is an imbecile
the kid with the camera seems like he wants somthing good buuuut hes not to bright on the way to do it now dont get me wrong a giant xray wall sounds great but it wont work will it not to mention the energy cost youd probably end up spending way more then the actual wall and the xray wall wouldnt even work for example if person a goes through the barrier and hes chipped it works greatperson b goes through the barrier and hes not chipped he still gets through tho because hes a criminal and dosnt care if you told him to turn back because he dosnt have a chip
love the shirt bro
that dude did not know what he was talking about
wow
so if blacks commit 51 of all murders and illegal immigrants commit 37 of all murders then the white us citizen population only commits less than 12 of all murders despite being 70 of the population hmmmmm but i thought white people in the us were toxic murderers its almost as we have all been lied to constantly
youssef was right  change my mind
el chopo
the dude that came on after the lady is dumb as fuck
that guy had a mental disability
should stick to the college campuses at least they have some intellect and can put together a rational argument
build the wall so trump doesnt separate children from their parents
890 democrats dislike
yes tax people that we cant find  brilliant
im not mexican im spanish but im from mexico
dear mr never governor of nm 1 checkpoint  point of entry 2 tracking id  visa 3 xray security  point of entry security  all already exist it was very hard watching your brain operate
hes on trending 
low iq as fuck lmfao
christ this one is weak reasonable immigration policy is obviously a sensible stance to take but this obscenely expensive and utterly futile ego trip of a wall is not the way forward the insane money and resources that would be spent on this no mexico wont pay never will never said they would could be better spent on facilities and security for the border a wall is just a rope away from being obsolete and totally ignore the vast majority of people crossing into the country by wait for it flight the wall is stupid it should not have been the focus of this discussion
his face at the end is priceless
im sure he loves doing these segments with people who are nowhere near capable or competent in having the knowledge to actually argue these issues it makes him look fantastic id love him to have a conversation with someone like trevor noah
that look at the end 
too bad we didnt get to see any arguments that steven could debate against what we got was just random rubbish
many illegal immigrants come over legally and just wont leave visa overstays arent going to be kept out by a wall because theyre entering through a legal channel its a waste of money that could be spent in better ways i agree that we need to do something about illegal immigration but im not convinced building a wall will really help
uh oh neighbours are climbing my fence gonna have to wall it up
we might find some areas where we disagree versus areas where we disagree rhmmm
new mexico entered the union in january 6th 1912 according to wikipedia
i feel like the mexicanspanish guy was an illegal immigrant because he knows nothing when it comes to how they operate citizenships
the future governer of new mexico is hands down one of the dumbest people ive heard
steven you are a very patient man that 2nd guy was like interviewing a kindergartner
i remember when i was in school i would get a student older then me and better hand writing to write me a note so i could leave school early which never worked  fast forward 7 years and this is what someone actually thinks  is a great way to deal with immigration just write a note as to why you want to leave  hahahahahahahahaha
that guy with the camera is the perfect example of lowereducational standards  not a bright bulb
the guy with the white shirt and back pack is a fucking retard what a fucking moron
build the wall
im for stricter border control and knowing who is coming in the country but i just think that wall would be extremely expensive yo build which would impact the economy
ladders
talking to a literal idiot
maybe a magic boarder scanning machine is needed
hahahaha what the heck is an xray wall
i dont support the building the wall because american tax payers will be paying for it we should just hire more border patrol officers
oh shit this ladys risking getting killed
the issue really is the cost effectiveness of the wall not immigration policy everything ive heard about this wall agrees that it would not have a large effect on illegal crossings or drug smuggling over the border for that reason i dont support the wall as it does not make financial sense however strengthening the stance against illegal immigrants increasing deportations etc i do agree with
good intentions bad logic cringy salute at the end
people are missing the point  we need to make mexico great so they dont want to leave it will also benefit the us tremendously having a prosperous neighbor
that spanish guy is not only a retard he is a dangerous retard that is somehow against borders but for microchipping the entire population and having checkpoints and scanners set up all over the citieswow
scientifical 
that second guy is brain dead and obviously doesnt understand statistics if a small minority is committing a large percentage of the crime then that is an issue this moron just said that anybody can commit crime wow
a xray border and a written reason why your leaving  change my mind
lol this dude just watched elysium or something when suggesting the human id scanner system
wtttf was that dude on  that was a good 8 ball huh  i mean this dude was all over the place first he wasnt for borders then hes talking about some craaaaaazy xray border shit  omg lol  dude the look on your face at the end priceless
i cant even finish this video its like telling a child why we need rules and regulations
so that guys had no idea whats goin on he wants to be governor 
they also need a wall around canada to keep the dirty americans out
its good if they dont pay taxes
when we build the wall we should make sure this guy is on the other side
this episode reminds me of what george carlin saidthink of how st upid the average person is and then realize that half of them are st upider than that
i dont want solid functional wall i want virtual xray wall lmao
y are people so smart 
this guy is an idiot  he finds people who cant debate our rationalize  lets see extremely expensive and he uses statistics from government websites which is extremely bias
please try and do this again
i hope they waited to post this until after ice came and took those guys if they lived in same place as her then this blurring does nothing they can easily tell who it was voice body shape mannerism etc
xray border and he wants to be governor of new mexico make it happen
lady lil snitch
ya what if we have aliens in hovercrafts patrolling the boarder and keeps count of all the people who come over and instantly tag them with a social security card and tax them some how ya open boarders
im a cheap prick great content tho
gogreenglobal has a hell of a spokesman he uses intelligent well thought out arguments to assert a position that is rock solid and logic that is indisputable   if you made it this far without recognizing sarcasm i cant help you
you should make a the civil war was not fought over slavery change my mind
refuse welfare to invaders
if we are going to have an open border then we ought to be able to enforce our lawstax those living in canada and mexico
most illegal immigrants come in on a temporary visa and stay past its expiration  a wall does jack shit against that
that guy is not spanish and i know because im a spaniard that guy is delusional if he thinks he is spaniard and not mexican
wouldnt you want a a death star and a companion chewbacca to go with your xrayid tag border
haha that second dude is cooked
do islam is not a religion of peace
lol i feel dumber after hearing the second dude describe the exact concept of what the wall would do but still doesnt want the wall built just build an xray wall
its funny how your president still hasnt built that wall he swore up and down that he would have mexicans build it and pay for it and low and behold the refused to do it and took him as a joke so now that he realizes america has to pay for it he forgot about it lmao this was predicted by all the non white dumb fucks
well that was a weak episode is it some sort of teaser 
that dude was being disingenuous about the issue then his solution is a borderless border with the same controls we have now
white tshirt guy talks much tries to sound smart but is really stupid
i cant believe im saying this but the college students made more coherent arguments
build the wall staff it with guys with guns and then shoot the hell out of any illegals that are seen approaching  cut welfare and anchor baby citizenship
why be ashamed of who you are
hey no wall you racistok but real talk we need some kind of wall
the argument against the wall is futile the opponents need to explain why they think illegal immigration is ok they have to explain why it is ok to break the law their only argument is that we should have a world without borders  which sounds on paper  beautiful  but is impossible to implement if done so today would see the world end tomorrow build the wall is impossible to refute leftists oppose it without being able to logically articulate why
what there was a midroll ad during the video keep it up steven
trump 2020 and 2024 change the laws
the second guest clearly has a sub 100 iq
xmen  the xray border wars
if not a wall thats routinely checked and guarded tighter than a ducks arse in water then outposts along the border like with high caliber rifles locked and loaded to eradicate anyone men women children even livestock who tries to enter illegally just shoot them bullets cost less than the paperwork neededprinted to document these vermin
lee roy just aint that bright sharp as a spoon
just tax them what are they in the mob now
im indian and i support strong borders especially with pak near us but i simply dont get why americans are protecting illegal migrants puzzles me
holy shit people are dumb
this nigga retarded
blur out her face but not her id badge
roll on new heaven and earth
this kid just described a modern version of nazi germany
thank you for staying respectful and engaged throughout all of your discussions steven
god that was horribleand he is running for office in nm god help them
electronic id tag yeah lets treat them like fuckin dogs and track them at a non existing border through an xray scanner while taxing them like slaves sounds great 
funny how the right go on about liberty and freedom except when it comes to immigration  then its all about government and regulations make up your mind guys
so they are demamding that wages get lowered
steven you are getting really good at picking apart arguments on the fly  keep it up
this guy is literally talking about rfid tagging illegal immigrants and doesnt see why thats clearly impossible let alone politically unpalatable
i am so impressed steven  i could not do these in the civil manner in which you do  you are a great guy
the guy basically wants microchips because they can just leave an id card at home and travel back and forth without being detected at a border wall checkpoint
as someone who studies information system  his solution is the dumbest thing ive ever heard
thats why we need a fucking wall idiots like that build that wall and put him on the other side wow dumb motherfuckers
the wall isnt going to do shit its just a status
leroy is a retard
when you just cant get on board with your opponent because you have to change his mind you go totally overboard suggesting an even worse idea just to have a position on your ownironic  he suggested to chip every mexican south the  border with a gps tracker  like a dog
say no to socialism change my mind
i cant watch something like this the opposition cant seem to string together a coherent sentence its like they dont really know what they believe in and are making it up as they go
oh leeroy i hope you didnt upload that video unless it is titled i got rekt he needs to sit down with a few masterminded individuals and have a free thought discussionladies and gentlemen the future governor of new mexico
the problem is progressivismpeople will try to come so long as theres welfarebest case scenario a wall delays the collapse a little bitbut when the guards hate their ruling class so much that theyre willing to open the gates for a small price it makes no differencehow progressivism developsvideo https www youtube comwatchvw8n3ff3kvulistplmnjr5bccuw40cpdjyxjyvsdysj7itdindex1book https www amazon comevolutionarypsychologybehindpoliticsconservatismdp0982947933refsr11sbooksieutf8qid1514984592sr11practical example of this happening to mice http www cabinetmagazine orgissues42wilesphp
fuck off dude if i a thirteen year old can disprove you and build the wall though along with my dozens of classmates but the second guy reads to many comic books the second guy is so fucking stupid
what a fuckin idiot how the fuck would u tax someone who is illegal if there is no record of them in the country
i hope they are able to protect that lady because her voice might give away her identity and coupled with location info it could be a big problem for her
so what you are saying is you want to build a wall
ya sure they are bringing the drugs but who is selling them   lol who wtf matters who is selling them if they werent here in the first place nobody would be selling lmfao
i cant listen to anyone who ends a sentence with an eah fuck you
i couldnt watch this babbiling mexican moron
what makes you think they are gonna use an xray border if they are trying to come illegally
sir not gay looks so super bad ass with that fanny pack i wonder what could be in it  does walther approve
im not mexicanim spanish lolokay my grandmother came from germany when she was two so im german
thats an idea we can just hire superman and have them scan everybody that comes across the border with xray vision dont you love people that have opinions and think of them right on the spot i fucking hate stupid and ignorant peopledonald we love you
look what happens when you open borders to immigration with a democratic mindset whites are now a minority in the uk guess what we are one step away from being the uk do you want the most popular name to be manuel or carlos in the usa
stupid lol
crowders face was gold when leroy salutes like al borland and shuffles off keep up the good work ill keep watching
this didnt appear in my sub box 
new mexico is fucked if that man becomes governor
build the wall with your ass
come through to salinas california and they will definitely change your mind
people dont want to sit and discuss the wall because there is no logical argument against it just feelings
the spanish dude man i wonder how low his iq is really painful to listen
the personification of a brain fart thanks for your input mr x ray
ill have you know good sir i may be a cheap prick you are right lol but i chose between mug club or a beauty and the beta tshirt guess who is drinking coffee out of a normal drinking glass while wearing a beatiful new shirt atm
build the wall and make sure this 1500s spanish retard is on the mexican side of it
this guy was very ignorant and highly uneducated
holly shit that second guy was painful to listen to like listening to a 4th grader talk about something they know nothing about just rambling
was anyone else bugged by the extra vowel that leroy added to every other word i was about to pop
id have to talk to a group of individuals
dude theres no way that leroy fella is a real person lol
both of these people were cringey stupid
build the wall with your assbitch lol
that guy was a crazy person
i wish i could sit down and talk with him on abortion i love all his political views except for that one i respect his opinions and i would have fun sitting and talking with him
an xray border that picks up your imbedded data chip which tracks all movements within the us and they say a concrete wall is oppressive and authoritarian
this is the first one ive watched and disagreed with i saw another commenter say it comes down to costeffectiveness perceptionand i agree except i dont know what they mean by perception first and foremost the most important aspect is effectiveness 40 40 is the low ball of illegal immigrants come by plane and over stay visas even other republican say its a dumb idea to build a wall along 1900 miles of the border is insanely pricey for such an inefficient wall shoot wouldnt surprise me if a bunch are coming in by car legally and doing the same as those who come by plane lastly mexican latin american immigrants are actually productive to the economy because they handle the jobs no one else will are actually highly  unlikely to commit crime when compared to native bornbut more than legal immigrants  and for the most part they bring a work ethic thats stronger than that found in other ethnic groups overall id say i disagree im not proillegal immigration because there is an issue with population growth being faster than economic growth but a wall is a no go for me
so his idea is a stargate of some sort unmanned requiring people to only complete a  promise note to be issued a ssn and then expect them to pay a toll tax and taxes going forward  but he wants someone else to do the work of figuring all this outokay
my irish ancestors came here legally what makes others so damn special
that fake spanish guy is retarded for real i mean literally mentally impaired
i know the real leroy trujillo ama
build the wallyou cannot change my mind
listening to that spanish dude made me feel tired lol damn cringe
i think you should alter her voice
i believe he could achieve his dream of being governor of mexico and still have bragging rights about his double digit iq
omg that mexican is brain dead
13 min was he beat up half way through lmao
do they not understand that illegal immigrants is people who sneak in with fake ids and people who jump the border or stay longer than they are allowed to we wouldnt know if they are in the country or not thats what makes them illegal second thing they cost more than they actually earn since a lot of them dont pay like income tax
the people that sat down were not that educated on the matter alot of maybes and ifs obviously this topic didnt bring an educated liberal on the matter cuz there is no winning this argument or a common ground also god help new mexico if he actually runs for governor
the only reasonable argument against the wall as far as im concerned is the fact that it would be paid for by tax payer dollars were talking probably billions of dollars however if it actually reduces the number of illegal immigrants that sneak through thus negating the negative impacts they generally have on the economy it might be financially worth it
thats a terrible blur job someone from her apartment complex could still recognize her
second dude makes my head hurt tax demm yeah just tax demmm yeah thats what make them citizens tax dem
the most common argument i hear against the wall is making an xray wall to read your code
that one guy was annoying as fuk
doesnt want a wallproceeds to describe a system worse than a wallok
you really cherrypicked a couple of real dumb people for this one nothing really gained by this segment
you should have changed that first ladys voice this is actually really really dangerous for you to have broadcast this you didnt even obstruct the id on her neck
the spanish guy is basically describing nazi germany only instead of yellow stars  its xrays and microchips
lmao he got called out on his bait and switch trickery right about 915
after listening to that guy i forgot math 
god crowder is so boring
that second guy was surely trolling you  there is no way he actually thought a scientifical x ray boarder was a real thing  i guess he can make it a real thing with his masterminds
how do build a wall around the rio grand
when dumb people try to sound smart thanks spanish guy
the wall is basically a metaphor whether it curtails the flow of illegal is beside the point  its a statement of sending a message that border control is a serious issue  none of the people that are against it would take the external doors of their homes and let anyone in if requested  they are uneducated hypocrites
1040 jesus christ this guy is off his rocker
a wall is a prison are you fucking stupid
i like how the dudes basically like dont build the wall thats inhumane lets just microchip them and tax the fuck out of them
you say its unedited but you blur out their face
that second guy had good intentions but he was not the smartest dude 
so sorry for all the idiots you had to deal with during this vid lol
that guy is so photosynthesis
13 minutes so controversial theres no actual conversations 1866dhs2ice 18663472423
it must suck for steven to go to all this effort and do all this preparation and then have no one willing or able to even have an intelligent conversation
this is one stupid mother fucker
many people dont know that there is already a wall separating the borders along with several border patrol surrounding the area night and day if the wall is funded not by taxing the people then build it not an issue i personally think that a bigger wall between the border wont change much people come here desperatley other ways some of which are by plane few cross right through and another small amount through the sea im not against building a wall im against getting taxed for building a wall that wont make much of a difference there are roads with potholes that id rather get paved to use tax dollars on pay the police better so they can do their jobs correctly and not be corrupt which is an issue not all cops are bad but that doesnt go to say that all cops are perfect either the point i want to get accross is people think the wall will make the immigration situation better for them but back in the us where everyone in the comment section presumably lives the economy would worsen due to high tax for a wall that wont change much i dont want bad people in the country sure a small percentage of immigrants and illegal immigrants commit crimes but there are bad people in this world regardless of where they are from some people seek refuge or assylum to get out of a country that they dont feel safe in when the process takes over a decade to get someone accross the border correctly its likley thay those people dont want to wait that long a few weeks maybe a few months but it shouldnt take yearsjust because it takes years to cross legally to stay is the reason people come to america illegally and stay they pay taxes regardless a tax number was relased saying a few million people that were undocumented paid taxes and made up a percentage in the revenue the only solution that i saw to have people prove that they could stay is the dreamers act which grants undocumented citizens legal work they pay taxes and work in the mean time daca seemed to be the best way to solve the undocumented issue until people thought that it was just a special pathway for citizen ship and thats pretty much what seeking assylum or refuge is a special pathway to citizenship if you have someone trying to kill you or being mistreated in one country that another one will take you in with open arms im not against that either but people are only arguing about daca and the issues and loopholes in the program im going to leave it off with this if the wall is independently funded and not taxed build it if you think that will help with illegal immigration but if it will be taxed why should we have to pay for a wall thought up by a billionare who has no political background but is now president just like the video i want a debate and discussion civil no hate because thay will just make you seem like an ignorant person there for your points will be invalid and just childish i want to know why the wall needs to happen if there is already a large metal fence blocking the border
future thinker 
was that dude high or what
manthe lady you were speaking to at the beginning was obviously limitedno need to exploit her
so fucking interesting i love these change my mind shows
crowders face in the end was too damn funny  i couldnt stop laughing  i could feel stevens pain sitting through a rambling of a gentlemen that just discussed another version of a controlled border
xray them bitcheeeees
build the wall with your ass bitch love it you could tell he was like 14
hahahahahha this guy had no idea what he was talking aboutand he agreed with u most of the time lol
another issue i support that crosses this debate is a federal sales tax get rid of income tax and tax all sales that means that not even criminals or immigrants get away with not paying taxes
that guy is a fool
lol xray gates p
oh jeez these guys who are talking are an embarasment they dont know shit
if they dont one day we will belong to mexicobecause their people will out number americanthis there planto take back the land we took from them during the war  people cant see the bigger pictureall they can see is crying babiesthe cant beat us at warso this is the plan to take there land back
so how about  border watch towers with heat sealing machineguns and armed soldiers collecting them and arrest them as  enemy combatants or we build a wall add cameras and sensors have actual gates at actual wall and better managed rules for entry overstaying criminal activity while here oh wait that makes too much sense we dont need idiots like gov moonbeam letting criminals  stay and do what ever they want
this should be in a college campus to maybe have other kinds of perspectives on the topic
how the hell did you keep a straight face with that last guy my hat is off to you sir
this video is terrible why even post it lol you should this again in another area
37 of murders commited by illegals sounds like such bullshit if they make up 35   sounds like such bullshit crowder stop lying nigga  stop nigga
glock is better than walther change my mind
that guy sucked
my friend believes there shouldnt be any immigration laws open borders he says my question is were can i find the statistics you mentioned on the video
this guy has far too much confidence given his intelligence
scientifical divisional  this dude is duuuuummmmbbb  ugh  liberals
i am so happy to hear that man is going to be politician and  governor  thinking we are going to live like black panter movie adn tracking everyone like in matrix with tags and scaners  on every coner 
this brown mexican from new mexico thinks hes spanish  lol
that guy was a living meme build xray walls not regular walls  im not mexican im spanish my family were in mexico since 1550 in 510 years we can go everywhere super fast and super cheap
about time you did one for the wall
its 2018 and the nonmexican guy lives in the 3000
so he says that this was a free thought and then he says that hes been thinking about this for three years sadly this was the most intellectual of the two conversations that steven had out there the one woman actually sounded genuinely concerned and otherwise ignorant of how building the wall could have benefitted her in her situation and the rest was just a bunch of hateful cowards with no balls to even come up and try to convince crowder otherwise if one of those people who instead acted like spoiled little brats had maybe tried to converse with crowder in a civil manner then maybe his mind could actually be changed on many of these segments although it is hard for your mind to change when you have done your homework and you are well aware of the facts that support your argument both statistically speaking and from a moral standpoint regardless these people are fools that will literally believe anything from the mainstream media
youre missing such a major point any  crime they commit is unnecessary and could have been avoided to say they bring the drugs in but americans sell it only further supports the notion they corrupt the society they enter think about it
think go green global watchs the buddhism hotlinecheck it out 
we dont need immigrants change my mind
to think this guy cancels out my vote good lord
anyone else here laugh at the irony of seeing hordes of mexicans hopping a fence chanting viva mexico as they literally abandon their fatherlandsorry how dare me personland
i want more keep that booth out there for a week let them come
congrats on the 2 million subs
unsubscribed change my mind lol git rkt skrub
i was actually hoping for a logical debate
that camera guy was fkn unwatchable
shes not a mexican american anything shes a mexican she needs to go back to her home country
a little trigger happy with those crtv ads are we
the guy talking about xray border is hilarious
xray border d hes going to be a great governor
kinda disappointing episode since they were just stupid people around
that guy is a good example of the product of public school
we should like tax them coming in we would if they went through the proper channels and got a social security number
stay off the drugs and tide pods man
ffs the lanyard i only just noticed is there a way we could cover that up before some leftwingers ruin her life
how high is that guy
fuck the wall nuke mexico city oh yeah also nuke madrid
america seems to be lost trump helps but there is just such a large number of lefty mental midgets domestic degenerates and brain dead foreign mongrels for our nation to overcome and 409 this guy was all three
xray borders 
leroy is an idiot
a wall without security is worthless and by security i mean cameras motion sensors flyover drones patrols stations strategically placed constant surveillancebut and heres the real issue  if you have these things why the fuck do you need a wall and need i remind people the cost of that wallalso people do realize that we arent just going to let people die on the outside right do people think that illegals are going to smash into it and then just sit there while we watch them die from the other side a border patrol agent will go out and collect them and we will be dealing with the same issuesa wall is fucking dumbits an idea popular with people that havent thought this issue through this isnt a mongrel horde this isnt a zombie army it isnt an armed invading force it is people seeking a better lifeand then when you add the fact that most illegals enter legally and simply outstay their welcome its pretty fucking stupid to waste money on a wallthe wall is for dummiesits okay to have been for the wall i was awhile back it made sense then it doesnt make sense when you learn the factsignorance is okay willful ignorance isnt
that guy saying there wont be any borders in the next 510 years is a total moron more worrying is the fact he clearly thinks hes pretty clever
the guy is basically calling for fascism totalitarianismi cant believe how ignorant some people are
that guy wants to be the governor of new mexico omg that guy was dumb as hell amazing lack of selfawareness
i bet this spanish guy is a lizard
so not one person a had any valid arguments against the wall and illegal immigration
ok so i know americans are horrible for stretching their heritage but claiming spanish from the 1550s
im not mexican im spanish yeah spanish my ass full indian looking guy
wait was steven not wearing pants xdd
im not mexican yeah sure that skin colour is obviously spanish and the amount of time his family has been near mexico of course wont do anything to his ancestry
absolute idiot that spanish dude correction future nm governor his entire idea was illegal immigrants need to legally enter the country  then tax them
wait dont secure it but do secure it huh and he wants to run for governor lol yeahhh well okay then why not d xd wow no
hmm its almost as if he was describing the process of some sore of legal immigration
ha ha xray border thats hilarious
i dont think the border is the issue i think the prevalence of welfare programs and the ease of tax evasion for illegals is the issue if we really dont want illegals to get advantages over legal citizens then we should eliminate the taxes and welfare programs that we are forced to pay for against our will rather than spending more money on a massive wall support the solutions that would put money back in the hands of its rightful owners the taxpayers not the solutions that would allow the government to continue stealing from its citizens
35 seems like a yuge number wheres the source
that spanish guy is a real idiot really like a special kind
these people should take the door off their house so we can come and go as we please if their for illegal immigration
build the wall and if caught here again we just shoot you as a invaderscrew this playing nice bs with illegals
they would just use a rope and more seatrespassing would be given
that last mf was dumb as hell 
capitalism is the best system change my mind
basically its untenable in every way building walls divides us building bridges brings us togetherstill im sure the millions of native americans slaughtered by foreign invaders might have agreed with building a wall a little late for that though
i respect the first ladys sentiments but it seems to be an argument out of emotion the second guy is a cloud cuckoolander
leroy coming in hot jenkinsssssss
less control with more control
socialism is for fgs change my mind you probably should wait until after pride month tho
that ending lmao
wall is too expensive
leroy youre a dumb ass
please do a tyt video
im against the wall because i dont think that it will have much of an effect but i could be wrong about thati am mainly against it because i think it could be used to keep you guys in instead of keeping the illegals out
just make them a citizen i dont know the criteria to do that but just do it so simple in his head
lets tell jeff sessions about this xray wall that the illegals can go through and automatically registered themselves lol the fools from the liberal left lol
wall or not we need to protect the border and prevent illegals enough already
was this guy coked up
so many mentally deficient ppl lacking critical thinking skills
dont need a wall just a big fence i think combine drones nightwatch tools the boarder patrols and  ok if you think its cheeper or better build that wall
why would u want to build a war it isnt visible and wont be worth at all
once this guy has his family raped and murdered i bet 1000 bucks he changes his mind 
pablo needs to lay off the crack
that guy took 3 years to come up with the idea of an xray wall
ha i actually know leroy he is actually a really good guy from new mexico people who say hes mexican are dead wrong please forgive his crazy ideas like he said there just freethought not how he actually beleives things should be he is a major pot head if you couldnt tell any way lots of new mexicans are spanish and have little to no ties to mexicans and most of the older generation new mexicans i met while living there despise new arrival mexicans themselves
your face at the end says it all
the way white shirt guy talks is annoying also hes a retard
the mexican guy is pretty much the face of leftism nowadays says a lot of big words spread out over different topics but has trouble answering even simple questions or provide solutions for the very real problems were facing and cant stay and argue the topic if his life depended on it
the spanishmexican guy sounds like hes having a heart attack and he needs to hurry before his heart give in lol
hi steven i am mexican and i really love this that lady who sat first to discuss maybe onto something maybe the wall is unnecessary theyll keep going to the united states like nothing i can see it as a symbol and a really good one but what trump is not thinking is that pushing something to much is not the way to go just look what obama did and it was working kinda right he put money in the hands of the mexican government and we were doing the dirty work not letting all those people cross to there stopping them in our south border without anybody making a hiss but now we have all these leftist trying to help the scum from south america because mah pipo using childs as leverage for their propaganda i can not emphasize how much i hate those people they are just scum they are criminals they are dirty and now that i live somewhat next to the zone near the passage of the beast train can see how fucked these peoples arethere may be good ones and a few exceptions but even my grandpa being a working illegal immigrant there told me the same they just like to make troubles they are lazy dirty they steal and they kill for easy money because is not their land nor their people they have nothing to take care of i support you and what donald trump is doing for the security of your people and i am waiting for the good of our countries that the new president to be elected in just a few days get to an agreement with yours to put an end to this im just hoping for the best in the situation of that poor lady and the scum criminals in your country god bless you and her and all your team ps tf was with that last dude violating the privacy of citizens with xray checkpoints and to think they try to advocate for those working immigrants lol
god help us
human races are no different than dog breeds and the different ethnic groups are born with innate and immutable characteristics just like the different types of birds frogs trees deer horses rabbits and most other species the third world is the third world for a reason and subsaharan africans and so called native americans never had a written language and were unable to harness the use of the wheel  both of these groups are primitive people who would still be stuck in the seventh century if it wasnt for european intervention  i dont mean to be harsh its just the way it is  europeans east asians and jews run the world for a reason and the idea that you can simply replace americas predominantly european population with any third world population and expect it to remain a first world republic is utterly absurd
do a part 2 of this please
scraping the barrel with that guy steven just because you can upload doesnt mean you should
listening to these people is torture steven you are the most patient guy ever
perhaps a timetravel border would be better so he can go back in time a few days to think his argument through
how would a wall hurt anything it opens up jobs and keeps illegal people out like cmon
that guy is a dip shit  he wants to set up an x ray like the tsa god help us
i wish you brought the statistics so you have them on deck all the time for the argument youre defending at hand
that look at the end was priceless love this series keep it up you guys are awesome
the spanish guy hes trolling so hard
spanish guy is describing the mark of the beastand a very orwellian repressive  worldand he doesnt even realize it  also having no borders is what the globalist elite want so they can wipe out any forms of nationalistic culture and ideals so they then become all those things just more culturalmarxism trope he learned at these indoctrination centers that used to be known as universities
wtf where did you get these retards from man
what is the deal with the weird white church van and why does that lady have a fucking plant in a bottle
forcemicrochipping everybody is better than a physical wall because it makes us all freer  change my mind
did anybody else think that the spanish guy leroy was going to have something valuable to say just because he had the camera as if he was a master debater maybe hes spends more time mastur
that dude with the backpack leroy holy shit first  you cant tax what doesnt exist so thats outyeah we should have a scanner system with a number system maybe we could have it on their wrisoh dearwell an xray could show us their heritage to figure out if theyre illegal yet make sure theyre the right racoh boywell we need them to pay taxes so we need to round the illegals up and keep them in a holding area like a camoh jeezwell we could have them complete a series of manuscripts on why they want to be citizens like a kind of diarshtevery proposition that dude had was easily more inhumane than just having a wall and they all go back
build a wall around leroy pleasejust to protect us from his ideas
capitalism is good  change my mind
i love this lady
scientifical  lol
i can never look at you the same since you were completely outclassed by yusuf not only did you resort to intimidation but you tried playing the crowd  to your side by making false accusations and jokes you clearly pick the lowest fruit hanging from the tree for these to make your self feel better
x ray boarders is my favorite new sentence change my mind
buildthewall
make them citizens and tax them  what a great solution
what the hell was that leroy guy smoking  gotta be the most stupid border proposal ever 
there can be many rational points against the wall if the budget for the wall is over 20 billion dollars and there is still gonna be a way to get across the border
for the commenters who ridicule leroys claim that he is spanish the hispanic residents of northern new mexico have identified themselves as spanish americans for a long time in part to distinguish themselves from mexicans who have immigrated to the us legally and illegally since 1848 the ancestors of the spanish americans have lived  there since the time of the spanish empire as far back as the late 1600s they were briefly citizens of mexico from 1821  when mexico won independence from spain  until the end of the mexicanamerican war in 1848 they became american citizens per the terms of the treaty that ended that warwhen i lived in new mexico most spanish americans i talked to were proud of their heritage and held disparaging attitudes toward mexicans in general they did not want their traditions to be subsumed into the culture of the new immigrants and they were not in favor of illegal immigration at all unless their attitudes have changed drastically in the last twenty years i would assume leroys opinions are not necessarily representative of spanish americans as a whole
theres at least 1 bad hombre in this video
for me to form a blatant thought i would need a team of geniuses fuck i love the retarded mexican guy too funny
i dont agree with the wall but more because from the stats ive seen way to many illegals are in the us by overstaying on expired visas these are people that most likely flew into the country and walls arent all that effective against planes  and those that are that desperate to cross on foot will find away to climb dig under or break through a wall that is too long to be watched at all times also leads to migrants making more dangerous risks i live in the u k and we have miles of fucking oceans for a wall and yet a retarded amount of illegal immigrants drug runners will always find a way that is just fact ive heard of some using fucking submarines to get coke into the us so i dont think the smuggling argument for a wall is valid i think the best solutions are streamlining the legal immigration process maybe allowing entry for workers under a temporary social security while their permanent entrance is being processed with the likes of housing benefits and being tightly restricted until citizenship has been established  secondly far harsher penalties for companies employing illegals like i said im english not amercian so genuinely curious what people think of these ideas and if something similar is already in effect
mayor huh
i dont think we should build the wall it would be a huge waste of money wouldnt stop them since most illegal immigrants dont cross that many of them come in with visas and over stay their welcome
what a moron hes going to be the governor santa fe
xray border ggaaayyyy
 i need them to come here legally but dont want a wall bitch shoot yourself in the face today please
your second guest was an example of who your first guest  wants to reportdeport hahahahaand he is a really really antismart
was there more to this video
man i wouldve loved to sit down with you and discuss this topic could you maybe do this at a college campus where people have at least half a brain
what is that accent leroy has
pay taxes social security number no border well if hes an example of the people who believe in this hes an assclown who wants to be a governor  just stopi hate thinking that they think there american
imagine a castle with no gate no walls and no guardsprotection just think about it
 04360439 say what 
go live in china they got a camera everywhere to see what the citizens are doing
theyre not sending their bestthat mexican kid was a fucking dolt 
one of the stupidest mistakes of our times is treating criminals as if they are innocent bystanderssomeone crosses the border illegally gets treated better than citizens in europe mexicans get into us illegally people start to cry that we didnt accommodate them in 5star hotels someone goes to jail for being a drug kingpin people constantly address her as a kind loving and warmblooded grandmaby encouraging those who break the law you are ruining the life of any lawabiding human being ie  i have been waiting 3 years for my screening process to get into a third country while filthy thugs get into europe daily and get paid for sitting at home being lazy slobs if you treat those who break the rules better than those who follow them you are a piece of shit your motives are irrelevant you are willingly making the world a shittier place by promoting lawlessness
love the change my mind wish the videos were longer 
no border no walls and no access pointaka port of entry  how do we know who comes in and out  what about the people who can not walk across the southern border of america how is that fair for other nationals who are not from south american countries  are they suppose to swim across the pacific or atlantic ocean  what about the people whos been waiting for years to get a visa to come to the united states  its like shopping at best buy on black friday to get a deal by waiting inline getting cold and wet for 10 hours to get in but some axxhole cut in front of 100 people   wow  food for thought
that was the dumbest shit i ever listened to wtf xray gate
points chowder did not argue againstwall will not stop illegal immigrationthe drug problems we face are not because of mexicowhat to do after illegal immigration persist after the wallnor does he take into account that 70 of guns confiscated from the mexican cartel were smuggled out of the us through proper border securitypro gunpro strict immigration laws
this is the best conversation you had all day
lmfao i couldnt even watch the conversation with leroy the spanish it was just too cringe had to skip past it
that wall just got 10ft higher believe me
hillary  we should build a barrier people  yaaaayyyyyyytrump  we should build a wallpeople  nooooooooooi guess it all comes back to the terminology eh
that last dude had no brain cells my god just think long term for more then 2 seconds before you speak bro
people in the comments helpi always hear people say but the wall will not stop the illigal immigrants most of them say that they enter through planes is this true and please cite sources thx in advance
so instead of a wall he wants everyone to be microchipped and constantly tracked and there to be airport security like checkpoints everywheretalk about progressive
we dont need a wall since trumps going to make real adeptus astartes  just get some preheresy night lords on this
and you wonder where the term libtard comes from
i think someone has watched total recall recently 
sex trafficking drug trafficking crime at disproportionate levels why wouldnt you build a wall borders are important if you make everyone who illegally enters the us a legal citizen the numbers of people flooding in will swell uncontrollably a vast majority will not find jobs and will go on welfare and the level of welfare being paid will be unsustainable the same as it is in the uk and australia bleeding heart policies are impractical but when it comes to the left nothing matters except their  domination of the moral high ground when the consequences start to affect them personally though it is then and only then that it dawns on them that their naive feelgood sentimentality might have been misplaced
how high was that young man
could not finish too much stupidity from both the woman and the guyjesus christ america is fucked xdd
i think we just need a robot army armed with lasers to melt people that dont come here legally
please do im communist  change my mind like if agree
man the talk show guy or whatever is high af
what an epic fail lol  the two people arguing against the wall say 1 i dont want the wall but please get rid of the illegals theyre putting my life in danger and 2 i dont think we should have a wall but i do think we should have a way to control how people are coming in  mike judges idiocracy
i really like the mexican woman a lot more than i enjoyed leroy because leroy sounded like a fucking retard
an expensive wall with expensive security sounds very idealsarcasm
whos paying for this xray border lmao
i demand a redo of this change my mind segment crowder i know this guy mustve been the only guy to sit down but really i love an intelligent debate but this was far from it poor guy just advocated a wall and a gate poorly argued your own point and then walked off like he had made a victory no crowder no fix this asap my brain needs a remedy lol
ive never seen steven crowder look as worried as when leroy left the booth
leroy needs medication
that dudes speech pattern was really odd
well that was a 13 minutes and 44 seconds im not getting backsorry for my english im spanish not mexican
morons
big brother is watching you
that one dude literally wants to tag people
this guy is a perfect example of how fucking ignorant is culture is oh my god this guys a fucking idiot just listen to him babel he makes no sense
i know two illegals that got duis caught with lots of cocaine and theyve been allowed to stay and they keep getting in trouble with the law
no borders this country was founded by immigrants built by immigrants and is made up of people from different ethnicities and backgrounds and thats what makes it so great as a society we have to all come together and just love and respect one another no matter where were from and knock down all these classes and borders and things that separate us can we just be human beings can we just co exist its not that hard
so that second guy wants to either imprison illegal immigrants and detain them until they pass the citizenship applicationtest or hunt them down and inject an rfid tag with their personal information into them that sounds way worse then death or deportation
there is no way he is gonna be governor of new mexico haha
i dont support the wall for one reason the cost to build it theyre going to get in one way or another just like a heroin junkie trying to find heroin the junkie will find its drug of choice
build the wall and take america back before it is too late
tax immigrants well thats kinda what happens when they come in legally and find a job what a fucken idiot
this guy deserves a medal  he went full retard
that spanish asshole was so dumb it actually gave me a headache
oh yeah  why only a wall try      arrows  bows horses elephants and cannons to stop em get medival on their asses
that guy in the white shirt has worms in hes brainlike put that man in a straight jacket or somthing holy shit my mind is totally scrambled in hes incoherent rambling
ok so id be for the wall under one condition the issue is drugs correct illegal immigrants doing bad shit so how about this all immigrants are welcome to the us if they speak both spanish and english because i believe the us should be a spanish and english dominant country also they must know the laws of the us so what would be the major catch right the mother and children will become us citizens right away granted the child goes to school and keeps up a 27 of higher gpa and the mother is responsible for that childs education and the mother and children will be supported up to a certain decided extent complete with housing and groceries and internet etc however all male immigrants over the age of 17 and fathers will begin working on cleaning up the us basically hard labor and community service they will be able to go home to see their families but must return to work as scheduled they will not get paid they will only be supported if too many days is missed or they quit there will be a warning and then a 2nd time with no reasonable explanation will result in prison time anyone who has seen me comment before knows i want inmates to start working on cleaning up the environment in chain gangs anyone who escapes will be put down even if caught again immigrants who start trouble such as drug dealing or starting fights or stealing and etc will automatically be put down as there is no longer a reason to do those things as they would receive housing free school up to an associates degree free  groceries up to a certain extent and free internet absolutely no reason for criminal activity those who dont agree with me while ya the fathers and men get the shit end of the stick look their new generation is the one awarded and the us environment could use more trees and less trash as it is population is too high so i believe many criminals need to be put down me being an animal lover even i understand that some violent dogs need to be put down i feel the same needs to be done with man kind anyone harboring criminals including drug lords should be imprisoned and will be put down unless interrogation was noncooperative in other words no more criminal action
theres already a large fence will changing metal for concrete make a differencegenerally curios now many illigals make it to america over the fence rather than just sneaking in vans and such or going round using the ocean
the second guy is hilarious  
new mexico say hello to your next governor leroy
90 of heroin in the us and canada comes from mexico how does it get here the fact that we could drastically cut down on drugs coming across the border and human trafficking that results should be enough to build the wall
this guy at 800 doesnt realize that illegal immigrants dont want to pay taxes
why dont we just purchase mexico and make it into 3 or 4 new states takes care of immigration and save money on a wall we wont need clean up the cartels and make the new mexican states tropical paradises for tourism boomwith immigration being in the forefront of politics and the fact that the mexican people are fleeing in the thousands daily we have only one way to correct the whole situation purchase mexico without a war or take over make all mexicans naturalized citizens forget the wall use that money to start fixing the infrastructure of major cities create jobs using the peoples already quality abilities and pay them decent living wages everything will take care of itself
hes literally describing border control idiot no borders but border control moron
hes a free thinker
no point you think a wall is going to stop anyone has it ever stopped anyone in the past of course not there are boats and planes ever heard of those i surprised your for that wall steven i mostly agree with what you cover but the whole wall thing is laughable people will climb over it dig under it fly over it or drift around it cmon well well see wont we we will look at the figures once the wall has been built my prediction immigration will increase
510 that guy looks mexican why doesnt he own up to it he doesnt look spanish white at all sad
this world is fucked and divided
qu pendejo
aliens are realchange my mind
i loved that video where joe rogan made you cry like a little bitch
why do u choose to interview the most ignorant people possible on this topic making the defensive side of this topic look clueless
haha his look after leeroy left
i used to live in the philippines there are a lot of drunks leroy is drunk
wut about the poverty families who like want a better life not even mexico but all of central america its a ganged up shithole down there but yeah they might bring their crime here so no one wins someones getting shot
is this guy out of his fucking mind he wants us all to be tagged like cattle
ummmm yeah    that just happened  i wish more people would have stepped up and had the conversation instead of screaming profanities from a moving vehicle  good attempt but i guess no one really had a good argument against the wall  
were there people yelling in the background
my opinion is that we should yes build the wall but if we build the wall we must make it more affordable to be a citizen building the wall will lower illegal immigration and those who wish to migrate to the us have more of an opportunity to become citizens if people wish to come to the us they should do it legally and correctly and it should be fair and affordable because sometimes people just wouldnt be able to afford it whats your guys input what do you think about my idea and what do you think could be improved etc
f
as soon as a i heard that leroy dude talk i wanted to stop listening to him immediately
if i start getting taxed for an xray radioactive scanner wall im gonna be pissed
im sorry this guy made my brain numb when i tried making sense of his xray fence
hey at least he was nice unlike the foul mouth millennials earlier in the video
hey steven i wanted to know where you get your statistics from exactly it seems like the area at which you get your information from is very reliable and updated i want to know so i can be educated on your view points for possible future discussions i may have or just to be simply educated on the same views you look at
his stupidity is obvious and it hurts me to watch him speak maybe spend some time researching what you think you believe and stop basing your beliefs off of your own skin color
the second guy needs some adhd meds or something
spanish guy was talking out of his ass
mexican dude is so obviously low iq
that second dude was annoying as hell ends every sentence with uh
i love these skids amazing how the people who get a free rides always have a problem with border protection
god it hurts my brain to hear the mexican dude try to sound smart
holy shit who the hell watches that guys show hes terrible at least on this
this guy puts a vowel at the end of every word whether it belongs there or not
they arr selling drugsuh
the white tshit guy is so full of shit like not every contry can get some fuckimg xray scanners that scan every person who walks through and even if you had the scaner its incredibly hard to chip every single person especially people from 3rd world countrys not stating that mexico is a third world country because im to lazy to research
funny no one wanted to talk about the wall just yell  insults
i dont knowyeah great base for arguing maybe inform yourself before shitting your stupid ideas into the world moron
i never understood why these people even bother i agree with your points but if i see someone sat down with cameras waiting for a debate there is no fucking way im stopping my shopping to try  coming from an unprepared scenario to argue with someone fully prepared lol
wow its so hard to counter stevens arguments
ahm could it be the fact that if u arent alloud to legali work that u start doing illegal work like crimes and why should a country that is completely build up by spanish immigrants suddenly stop to let their sister and brothers  immigrat i mean the only ones which realy owned ur country where slautert what if thes guys suddenly dont want y all well i guess thats a thing that never happens after a genocide
second guy should write a sciencefiction book xray robots scanning people on a border 
omg xray border wtf do he think everyone is born with a rfid chip lol well obviously in order to execute his plan you would need a big ass wall and at the entrances you have doctors chipping people to keep track of them in the country so he is not only for the wall but also no privacy at all and he talk about wanting to go into official government position damn he is to stupid sorry bud lol
yesah ohah imah spanichah dont speed upuh
baffles me when ordinary people talk of open borders as some sort of utopia  when infact its just the globalisation of poverty richest 1 is laughing their asses off
this entire topic gives me a headache
retina scanning is the way id do it both eyes and dna samples for the database
holy fuck that spanish guy is low iq
that second guy is lying for suremoronthat first lady was more confused but a nice lady
514 yo thats whats up new mexico for the win
this guy is literally retarded
in my opinion the only valid argument against the wall is its potential ineffectivity and the costs related to it
why you do dis next time spare me the brain cell loss that i had to got through listening to that guyuh its was really annoyinguh now hes got me talking like thisuh
mexicans are native americans whites immigrated mexico is native word in the nhuattle language walls are built to keep people in not out remember the berlin wall
build one around canada two
whos ready for the space force 
620what percentage do you think commit crimesliterally 100 of illegal immigrants are criminals if you cross the border illegally you have broken the lawits very simple
leroy as a dungeonsdragons player would be the type that tries to take over the dungeon masters story making up a bunch of shit to make his character who is also called leroy look awesome and the whole frickin fantasy realm revolves around him and his unicornriding superhot princess girlfriend who cant get enough of his demonslaying dragon dick which needs its own separate strength score because its the buffest part of his ripped body by far
that guy was hilarious these videos are always interesting i disagree with almost all of the talking points but its still a pleasure to watch that being said a wall wouldnt change anything except put a big hole in everyones wallet because mexico sure as hell isnt paying for it they can tunnel underneath and we would still have to post similar numbers of border patrols yeah lets build a big ass wall that actually ends up hurting taxpaying americans great plan its funny how people on the right cant understand how the government would get the money to make colleges tuition free but when it comes to a wall all of the sudden we have all the money in the world to spare the government need to take some of the money in our defense budget as well as the money that wouldve went to a wall and pump it all right into education its becoming more and more obvious every day how much americans truly need it
lol build wall soon
congrats on 2 million i think someone found your kryptonite say   things  lol
dont build the wallshoot the border crossers on spot
the wall is stupid  an armed border drone like on babylon ad would be better
hey so a suggestion im unsure if its worth trying but do something about the fake wage gap
holy shit uninformed people with idealistic opinions talking garbage
home is a pen humanity are cattle
these people barely have an education why dont you talk about this at a college hmmmm
arent sanctuary cities and states a 10th amendment issue just defund them and let them suffer the consequences
in my opinion you should have censored the woman better the people who shes afraid of will still recognize heri know you dont have to legally and i get that you didnt but she might be in danger nowplease dont tell trump about the xray borderthat would be expensive
when the knee jerk emotional impressions of muh racism and muh trump rhetoric are dispelled its literally almost impossible to dispute the argument for a wall unless you just want to argue for open borders
why hasnt anybody proposed to the us to just annex those problem causing central american countries 
this guy is just a waste of time
xray wall not a bad idea but think about thiswhy not just have a fucking force field  ive got to write this one down
that boy wants to irradiate people with xrays at fucking random to bone scan id illegals who will be pouring in from everywhere costing hundreds of billions in salary and medical equipment fees but he doesnt want to pay 30 billion for a simple wall
the last guy was an idiot
im not mexican im spanish my family moved here in the 1550slmaoso deluded
wow what a moron
would have to speak to some computer engineers hahahah how fucking delusional is this guy
that spanish guy who sat down and talked with you is not only a moron but also a tweeker
build the wallbuild the wall
for the love of god build the wall and deport leroy we already have enough stupid in this country we dont more of it
i swear the spanish guy is high on something 
you guys are fuckin idiots if you think a physical wall will stop anything i actually liked crowder but he supports this bs documentaries with mexican cartels show them saying to go ahead and build the wall because thats not how they transport drugs or people they use american people to do it citizens the reason people flee mexico is because violence and lack of money and gov help violence comes from cartels cartels come from lack of money so they make money off american junkies that need their meth and the mexican government is corrupt as shit fix the drug issue here in the us cartels wont make money off of drugs no more cartel no more violence no more corruption from cartels paying off cops and politicians and people wont flee mexico for a better life some cartels provide for their towns so thats why some towns support them because they help we dont need a physical wall that wont stop them find another solution to the immigration issue its mostly racists who want to keep immigrants out anyways its the same people who get upset if you talk spanish around them
i think youve changed my mind build the wall
that mexican guy saying he plans on being the gobernor of new mexico with his idea of an x ray wall is too funny
i think mexico needs held responsible id make them pay for allowing illegal entry into united states of each illegal that comes here considering the resources we use not fair play
im writing from mexico  we need to deport your fucking companies back to your countries who keep coming to mexico and south america for cheap labor and let our own industry flourisn  weve been doing your shitcars electronicsetc for less than half price for the last decadesfor all those who dont know shit of whats going on your corrupt ass us govt and megacorporations are in bed with our corrupt ass govt they make sure to keep wages low here so you can all get cheap shit  so our ppl suffer because of it and the less educated who are the ones that end up in usa immigrate you want cheap shit well then there are consequences like ppl who cant make a living in the country you are vampiring and going to your country illegaly and so they go to your country just to get treated like shit you ppl are ignorant instead of attacking the greedy ass companies who you can regulate you attck poor ppl who are fighting for crumbs and are victims of circumstance so when you say build the wall and mexico you pay for it i say fuck you just take your shitty badly paid companies back assholes the whole lot of you well not the wholelot some of you are ok in my book the smart ones
can we redo this one on a college campus
this wall building shit is stupid think about it why would america completely ditch the foundation of the country and resort to medival strategies to keep their taxpayers out like wtf
paris is burning
so i agree with  the wall idea because last i knew when i was driving backandforth to el paso from albuquerque theres been a sign on the border stating that new mexico was going to be reclaimed by mexicans because it was wrongfully takeni do not agree with at legals coming over mainly because i have encountered issues with certain illegals i do not think we should have any sanctuary cities for that is act of treason to say that another country citizen is more important then the citizen of their own country is treasonous so you will not change my mind on border security there has been too many people whom have lived in new mexico as an illegal and never got their papers at the opportune time instead they waited 18 years to get their papers and how that was allowed i dont know also my brothers grandmother  was upset that someone could have the audacity to think this this was ok and not a shameful act to come to this country and fill entitled to it after all she had to come here legally from mexico my mother was hit by an illegal allien in a automobile accident with no drivers license no insurance so yes its a growing pandemic
hes from go green global so hes words dont surprise me
leroy for president
i really dont get the conservative position on the border wall most illegal immigration comes through the air and water with people overstaying their green cards so the wall is more a symbolic gesturebut what conservative would support spending atleast 10 billion on symbolism this is an extreme misuse of government and more a leftist stance if you want better border security why not spend the 10 billion on actual better security instead of wasting it on good feelingsfacts dont care about your feelings and the fact is the border wall is just a huge waste of money
haha crowder just gives up and lets him talk after he proposes his xray border
just tax them what an idiot
i can guarantee you that the guy in the white shirt is not a spaniard sure he might be mixed but he is definitely of mexican heritage or descent
freeloader here
basic iq test for the right to vote
you start to give all theses people citizenship while not taking into account that they will start to vote democrat and continue to destroy this country for everyone
not dismissing the idea just trying to pick a side but im a little on edge you want to build a wall but we dont have the money for it they are saying make mexico pay for it but i doubt they will do so willingly so what do you want to do make them pay by force
would you ever change your mindever
and this are the average citizens no wonder schools are failing and people are electing for democrats
imagine being mexico and millions of your citizens want to gtfo
i get what leroy was trying to suggest seems like an idea  but as he admitted he isnt smart enough to make it applicable to the real world  also steven a great one for when people say a wall wont work hungary has dropped illegal immigration to almost 0 with their wall
youtube unclicked the bell for me so thanks youtube so when i repress it it shows pressed for moment then unclicks checked another channel it just this channel
not even hiding your racism now
when the first guy said his family has been in new mexico since the 1550s
strawman argument but editing in the dumbest responses
1342 hey  im scottish its my cultural tradition to be a cheap prick
so that guys solution to illegal immigration is a process to become a citizenthats a special kind of stupidthey are avoiding that existing system hence illegal immigrants smh
you should do slavery was a choice change my mind
im against the wall only because people who do try to get here legally takes way too long and by the time they are able to come to the united states legally most people cross the border for better lives and try to get away from that and give opportunities to their children i wish they can just make legally coming to the usa faster
build that wall strong and high
everyone should have barcodes on there arms so we can track them
my god these people are stupid if you remove borders and allow anyone in the whole third world will move here no one wants to live in a shithole countryand his solution is tagging everyone
mexico has a wall all along their southern border and they stay busy deporting illegals why cant we have our own tall and beautiful wall so we can keep our country safe
the wall just needs to go up already illegals need to be kicked back over the rio grande and if they want to come back they can apply for their citizenship pay their taxes and we will all be fine fucking pieces of shit
just build a wall and problem solved
i was waiting for leeroy to say something likeeyyy well maybe like we give them a stickurrrr or a badygggeee that dey wear man so we know dat dey came through the x ray machine brooo
go green global im going to stay farrrrrr away from them
lmfao  1011 i would have to get like a few mastermind individuals  sketch bomb
build the wall with your ass so pathetic it made me laugh
this guy is an absolute fruitloop and he is definitely on some kind of drugs
well there is already a fence separating mexico and the us until the rio grande river you have thousands of border guards patrolling 247especially in areas with dense population i am just wondering how will the us government justify spending billions of dollars on something that frankly never worked throughout history if you really want to eradicate illegal immigration start with the countries from where these people are coming from invest in them open new jobs create better live opportunities and afterwards youll see a decrease in illegal immigration the thing is people always find ingenious ways to go around artificial boundaries and i think the best example is the berlin wallmy point is this is a populist policy that doesnt have a predecessor in history when it comes to it being successful i am no lefty god forbid nor on the other side of the political spectrum i am just being rational hope to hear your thoughts
spain should sue leroy for defamation of national character
its so sad how dumb some mexicans are
build the wall with your ass proof that liberals really dont know how labour is done
does this guy think money grows on trees xray wall wtf
how to make illegals stop coming here dont let them get welfare disability or any benefits cant get legal cant get anything dont expect us who pay taxes to pay for your bullshit im glad theyre gonna get deported less economic stress
americans just mad mexico made it to the world cup and the us didnt better luck next time us dont be so hurt btw we beat germany 
that guy what
build that wall fast 
jesus christ i cant watch this these people cant even form coherent sentences
did you help that women move to another place  i hope non of the illegal immigrants shes fearing watch this video cause shes very easy to identify
500i cant fucking stand people especially men who inflect the end of their sentences upwards at the end as if theyre posing a question
nothing bothers me more than calling an immigrant illegal their action was illegal undocumented immigrant is the accurate term building a wall wont solve the problem believe me when people are desperate to escape their country they will find a way to enter why do people enter the us illegally because the process to come here legally is made nearly impossible in addition yall are aware that there are current undocumented immigrants that entered the us legally latin americans arent the only undocumented immigrants so if americans really want to prevent there from being undocumented immigrants might as well create a dang dome around the us lol
seems like its all out war with the left they are just blatantly lying now about the mexican childrens living conditions and treatment what can we do they own the media and know they can tell people anything the want and people will eat it up like candy they dont know its poison candy the msm is handing out i think communist china has more truthful news than ours now
the second guy was an idiot  taxing illegals they already send their money back to mexico
man that snitch lady is gonna be found in some ditch next week blurring her face wont help
1135 im fucking dying
so lets just get the folks that came here illegally to wear a handy electronic tracking device makes perfect sense and he wants to be the governor
does anyone ever change their mind i love this show but i just thought about this
i have tried to watch this i really did but that spanish nub is either braindead or full of drugs watch his moves and my braincells are commiting masssuicide when trying to listen to him
have you considered environmental impact
they all must go back change my mind
xray gate nice
how high was that guy 
illegals are an issue there is no denying that i couldnt go to mexico legally for example but i dont think a wall is the solution most illegals dont just walk over the border anyway not only would it not eliminate the problem itll create more problems my tax money is going to fund this wall i dont support
the wall is to expensive and people would still find a way around it
why is it only 10 min  
bruh you already know the second nigga trolling lmao
for real 5 months in laand i could deport 60 plus people some of them stole game systemsdealing drugsunderhanded shityet legal poor working ones i lived with hated those people tootheir fucking family almost and they worked their asses off for no moneyfucked up and fuck those people
keep him out 
okay but how the bloody hell are you even going to afford to build a wall that long its extremely expensive close to 11 billion correct me if im wrong pls where is the money going to come from it will most likely be added in your taxes why is no one addressing the financial difficulties about actually building a wall
yes keep doing the change my mind bits its real good stuff
the wall is stupid it will not help as much just a reform
im not mexican im spanish my familys been in mexico since 1550isnt that like literally 90 of mexico or america in general for that matterpretty sure that most of the population of the americas is immigrant from the old world as most of the natives died to disease
a few mastermind individuals
the second one doesnt want the wall to be biuld but rather total surveillance with his chip id and xrays
is steven aware he is a famous meme
these are most likely the two most clueless people ever on change my mind 
that face slayed me so good
building the wall and keeping the illegals out would certainly keep these families together problem solved
all i saw was an incredible amount of ignorance regarding illegal immigration shows how the demsleft have successfully muddied the waters to the extent people can no longer form intelligent opinions i wish i didnt have to think this is deliberate
great topic i hope there is a part 2 because this one was pretty dull
the guy from new mexico is so fucking illogical 
leroy for new mexico governor lol
just a heads up for you guyswhen you see a person saying boarders instead of borders then its a shill its by design
such a leftist answer lets tax themoff topicin california where i live voters love voting for taxweed was legalized with tax as the voter motivatorplastic bags are taxed thanks to voterscigarettes are insanely taxed
sounds like the guy should be in favour of a wall to keep the illegal immigrants out while simply making it a much quicker easier and cheaper process to legally immigrate
make a no mans land between mexico n usa hire thousands of snipers n allow them to shoot at sight equip drones with guns and make online games to shoot illegals children shudnt b excusedmany legal mexicans are scared of these jllegals too they give a bad name to mexico
do a i dont believe in gay marriage  thatf be very controversial and entertaining
welcome the future governor of new mexico 
idiotic people are interviewedthe wall is too expensive to build  it shouldnt be built  why does the usa have the ability and right to have its currency as the world reserve currency  then it should allow easy immigration into the usa
scientifical
he didnt know what he is talking about
i dont get how there seems to be people that think you cant go past the wall in any way whatsoever if its build
the wall is not practical the only way they could truly prevent anyone from crossing with a wall if they go full berlin wall i highly doubt thought the us wants to put land mines because they will be scrutinized if one goes off and kills a child personally if the us want to stop people from coming over from latin america go full middle east on them pull a reagan and declare a war on drugs and declare that fighting the war on drugs involve fighting against the cartels dont worry we wont send our soldiers to fight them we will arm locals who might or might not be extremists so they can fight the cartels there is a strong chance these newly formed militants may overthrow their government but hey thats not our problem hey but as long as no illegal aliens cross our border that new government is okay we me im not racist i just dont like these damn illegals taking jobs from good americans
an xray that reads your id boi thats gonna take a lot of xray machines to do so also how can you trust that everyone will voluntarily show their id and tell the truth of why theyre going over the border
well ask the people in israel if they would like to destroy the wall they have against palestine and see what they will answer
governoro wow
i agree with you on a lot of stuff but this no god gave us everything on this earth who is anybody to tell that they cant come here thats terrible
the second person the guy was somewhat hard to listen to do to the way he talked i enjoyed the discussion but like his inflection was just awkward
that spanish guy is a moron
so we have a built in chip with our numbers on it then put random checkpoints throughout the country to see where you are first of all he just described something from the book of revelations  second thats so much worse then a wall would be and probably more expensive and harder to control
smokes way too much weed
leroy  maybe we can have sharks with fricken lasers on their heads manning xray super walls to let everyone in
317 my look exactly after listening to the guy in white ramble about nonsense stuff
i need a longer fix of change my mind this is too short to fulfill my needs
borders a thing of the past every country has one
so no to a wall yes to the mark of the beast got it
i wonder how crowder kept a straight face with that guy
why do people get so offended by the concept of a wall seriously why is it so horrible to have good border security trump said a big wall and a big door they can come in legally whats bad about that  people who object for border security should remove the locks from their house and put up signs where they welcome any visitor day and night even if they themselves is not home
no border walk but lets tag people like animals
the guy has 100 enthusiasm 0 rational
tax them make money off of themwhat the fuck are you feeding these people
this first guy is thinking 30 years in the future lol
steven crowder only ever debates low iqlow info leftists once he starts getting his ass handed to him by people who are smarter or further to the right than him he cuts them off interrupts then kicks them off the set change my mind goy
im from new mexico and the guy from here embarrasses me he is delusional and a fool
good lord these people are slow the new mexican guy must be completely baked
boy im glad he considers himself spanish even though his bloodline definitely yells indio otherwise hed give us mexicans  a bad name really his solution is to tax the shit out of poor people trying to eke a living wow whats next put a microchip in them too idiot it looks like this youtube channel filters out the interviews and only airs the ones that make the interviewer the smartest of the debaters you can deny it all you want but its too obvious kind of like fox news
lots of dud interviews
the wall is dumb
im quite positive i lost brain cells listening to these people
what in the world is the future governor of new mexico talking about
america first muthafuckas protect your home first
trump is racist and misogynistic change my mind
find someone who is actually againts the wall and educated on this topic and not telling fairy tales
pretty sure there already is a wall at the border
i like how the people are willing to discuss it
x ray border shit why not      still want a 70ft wall though
do this one again
its going to be expensive many estimate it to be like in the billions and on top of that the money coming in to maintain it
first stevencrowder video i watch question does steven actually support the building the wall idea or is he playing devils advocate  btw that leroy guy is out of his mind lol xray wall
comment secton s fcked p rght now  yote s roken
liberals are simple to understand  they go around in circles when they try to present their case so as long as you understand that youre good to go 
that blurred out woman at the start holding the flower vase like a drink
this guy has clearly never read machiavellis the prince
this sucked
xray boarder    wall  i know they mean well butt they gave not a clue
lol i would do anything to have a discussion with you in the streets especially concerning this topic but i wont be picky will you ever come by brooklyn ny for one of these events
just put an x ray wall problem solved
just shoot them  after the first few hundred get popped the flood will become a trickle
meh lame what a couple o tards
why isnt this video as long as the rest of them i find that really suspicious i was hoping to see something around 1 hour long
that dumbass zoolander liroy d just tax em i want to build schools for boys who want to read good and do other things good tooand like crowder eventually points out how do you tax them when you dont know they are there dalso xray border lmfao
america goes thru way more dirty shit and people worry bout building a wall  just cut the borders and let everyone roam freely theres no problem with that yall white people just stingy lol
build the wall with your ass bitch
2000 mile long xray border that tags locations of illegals after they enter
i can never quite tell if this guy is playing devils advocate or actually holds true what he says hes a damn good actor if he doesnt
is that pogo music in the background
scientifical haha
steven what about blacks doing killing and selling drugs theyre  more killings and drugs in the black community what are you going to do about that
i believe there are 3 key points to argue here1 cost2 effectiveness3 perceptionunfortunately this videos attempt at a debate was disappointing to put it politelyperhaps the bigger problem with these impromptu debates is that it heavily favors the host because as the host you are the only one who was given time to prepare showing a bunch of people flipping you off or yelling at you is great for entertainment value but it should not validate your position in any way unless you are debating whether or not people can be assholesbest of luck with future debates ill probably watch a couple more but please screen your contestants better or it just comes off as a predatorprey trap thanks
steveyou wasted too much time on senorle leroy you only had 2 people come up to you
if you say to me you are pro illegal immigration then i will give you one chance to retract if you dont then you are getting kicked out of my home im not lying
seems like a huge waste of money with little benefit in my opinion
xray boarders mark of the beast
seems like most people are for a wall but just say they arent becausefuck trump
rought time for that buhl
wow
i knew crowder was sort of an idiot but after this change my mind i know for a fact he is instead of being a productive and effective speaker crowder goes for the arrogant im right and your wrong tone of voice which highly ineffective also has no understanding of what makes america so powerful its the cheap labor and opportunistic taking advantage of uninformed people so now all of a sudden you want to build a wall now that america is well established and the bridges and buildings are built railroads etc from the irish chinese africans and the more recent mexicans cant take back all the hard work that built this country the least we can do is be grateful and appreciative
lmao that dude doesnt even look castizo let alone spanish
1000 miles of wall is a lot it would take over 3 times the amount of concrete as the hoover dam and since concrete needs to be reinforced with steel it would take about 5 billion pounds worth or steel and unlike the hoover dam it has no financial benefit it will cost 10 times the amount as the estimated amount and thats not including maintenance cost its a ridiculous waste of money and wouldnt even solve most of the immigration because most of them come over buy flights anyway stupid americans
the internetz just became more stupid because of leroy
the last guy is a mestizo from america his ancestors were from spain and they obviously mixed with the natives a lot in america to create him mexican is not a race so he cant be one just because he looks like one and even culturally hes not mexican because he said himself hes not from a mexican family and he doesnt identify with being mexican and rightfully so if you want to be exactly correct hes an american by nationality and a mestizo by race he should have never called himself spanish and people in the comments shouldnt be calling him mexican
how come it seems crowder interviews people who dont know what they are talking about is it because it makes him look better or is it a situation where the most ignorant ones are the ones with the loudest voices like seriously out of all the people who sat down we get to watch xray border genius with his 3 mastermind team
the xray idea made me think of total recall
13mins long wtf
leroy needs a gps because he is driving lost he is all over the map on this
holy shit that guy sounds like hes high afmake scifi tech to let illegals in on purpose then give them citizenship automatically so we can put them into debt with taxesbtw im going to run for governor for new mexico
73 of illegals are on multiple forms of government assistancetaxing them lol make  them citizens lol alot dont want to be citizens umm e verify  fine the crap out of people hiring them not very bright
a wall is a bad idea but a giant xray machine that can somehow id anyone who crosses the border is good wot
xray guy is high as hell  holy crap and dumb as rocks
you need a borer wall to that chair those guys were dumb as mud
austin is retard city
this guy is an idiot
only cowards hide behind walls real men face the challenge
the guy who is against the wall  want the mark of the beast for all an rfid hehhee dam kinda worst than a wall to me
bro who is this dude with the white shirt hes a comic lol
x ray gate that can read your id
if the wallproject had a weekend working volunteer program i would sign up and help
i dont believe leroy is his real name
for somebody who thinks a lot logically most of the timebut with thisi think youre as dumb as trump after all just took my subscription back  to think you know peopleor from  canada shameful
we need part 2
make them citizens then tax them like that wouldnt start a whole fucking equality debate why dont we just chip them and put them in cages well tbh some of them belong in cages and should be used as food for lions
poor guy at the end is an idiot
can u make these longer
i love how the second guy doesnt want to build a wall but just wants everyone to have some kind of electronic marker it almost sounds like hes talking about an implant and then some sort of xray wall that automatically scans everyone coming in and scanners in cities that track your location  how about some robot laser cannons that zap you if you commit a crime then bro sounds good to you too holy shit talk about dystopian future d
usa is officially the dumbest country
im against the wall because its not worth the effort illegals dont just walk across the desert they usually use much more conventional methods like tunnels and using vehicles or just plain taking advantage of policy we really need to focus on the apprehension of illegals in the country already and fixing broken policies
now correct me if i am wrong mexico this week started its own earthquake by so many people jumping up  down during a fucking soccer game and they cant do anything about their shithole countries crime and corruption problem why
youre spanishyour family has been in mexico since 1550 yeah youre a mexican
crowders spooked look at the camera at the end if ever a simple glance conveyed the message wtf  it was that one
why do they vote for the same things that made them flee their country
heres how i see the wall imagine building a fence on your property except in this case its massive and is a wall spanning across the country back to the fence okay so you take your fence and you spend money to keep out animals criminals neighbors and to separate your property from others now continuing with this fence reference if someone jumps over your fence into your lawn and starts destroying the grass or just walking around wouldnt you call the cops to kick them out
even though my mother cuban born was an illegal immigrant should of been legal the moment she made it to american soil at the same time her parents did while she was in diapers i still say we need to build that wall only allow people in who come from countries whos government will kill them if they ever return just because they escaped their country like cubans used to have before obama now if an illegal immigrant cuban gets caught in the us they are sent back just to be executed by the cuban military police
a tunnel will get you onto the other side of the wallchange my mind
im against illegal  immigration but the wall is unrealistic
this is just stupid and umdermines all your other opinions
haha he is not spaninsh
mr steven more lemon pledge
steven crowder i support trumps tax bill i think dead billionaires and people with private jets are paying too much in taxes also sc illegal immigrants making less than minimum wage dont pay enough taxes
where are the memes someone make this guy a star he can be the governor of kekistan
cross the border illegally  we tat a dick on your  forehead a big one with vains sack hairs then send you home
why does the mexican ummm i mean spanish guy winkwink add uh to the end of a lot of his words so weirdedit he seemed like he was a little slow
talks about a sci fi future  says 510 years
what the second guy suggested is literally worse than a border wall lol
steven how did you not laugh your ass off when talking to the second guy
i want to say a couple things first i know its more of a kids movie but i think you should breakdown the incredibles 2 second i live near idaho state university in pocatello idaho i think you should have a change my mind there personally i think talking about islammuslims would be a good topic there please let me know what you think of my thoughts god bless
borders will become a thing of the past in 510 yearswhat kind of fluffy stupid gay ass imaginary world do you live in
im down for the x ray scanner
we need xray scanner towers bro
the xray boarder is the key
1316 why are we still here just to suffer
jesus christ that 2nd guy
i dont think a wall is a good idea change my mind
how dare you suggest building a wall lets build a massive cancer barrier and microchip everybody insteadlmfao
i think that people who are here illegally should be allowed to sign up for the us military and after serving 5 years in the military they are granted citizenship
b o i  g o t  a  p l a n t  i n  w a t t e r
hes very low iq
you sure spoke to some real winners on this one if anyone is for illegal immigration just have them listen to these idiots theyd quickly come to our side 
spaniard  not spanish  spanish is a language pendejo haha
built a wall or build a town to help them out to get out of war that is going on down there  can also get jobs up and running and give any person an aportunty to get back up from probs going on need a lot of people to get it running though and cash  but i dont really know much probably a stupid idea cough mexico and the us can pitch in to make it happen as one  yeah its pretty stupid darn brain thats what i would do if i were a president ill shut up now
dear america how about you diminish your criminality then you can think about mexican criminality
bahahaha an xray wall what in the literal fuck
mufucker said scientificallmmfao
you always choose people that dont know what they are talking about and have not done the research also when someone states an argument that you have no response for you change the topic you are a good debater and you know how to create conservative propaganda i want to see you debate against someone intelligent
build the xray wall fucking idiotahe is why we need the wall
ladders
second kid is stupid
nice to see you doing change my mind videos again these are the best
this guy is an idiot xray border
until everyone agrees to pay for utopia we wont have utopia
i would say that the wall shouldnt be built because it would cost a large amount of money not only to build but also to manage i think trump should come up with a better plan to stop illegals from entering
that was pure stupidity in the flesh 100 no cut
jared at 1145 lol
she was confused you fucking dick  i used to respect your show
lolwhat the fucki loved it
sorry but the dude with the camera was trying soooo hard to get his 2 brain cells to work together
why have a wall when the majority of illegal immigrants come by plane
isnt south africa a perfect case study as to the future of any borderless country
my roots are spanish  from spain  hes not one of us for sureuuuhhhh him or his x ray scanner  next time please provide drug tests prior to interviews
cos fantasy is so much better than reality that guy is such a typical whim worship libtard
i am for enforcing border security measures i was a legal immigrant that went through a 12 year process to immigrate to the us then another 5 year process to become a citizen but its very important to keep in mind why people choose to immigrate to the us and i hope we can secure the country without losing our humanity and moral high ground  but i really hoped you had a more competent person to argue against building the wall because this was just sad and you stevencrowder can do better than this
jesus christ that leroy guy is incredibly retarded how does he function in his daily life im just shocked with his stupidity built that wall already ffs
the wall is larping and will never be built im more hard core than any of you on the invaders but im a realist trump is a showman who has duped you into a pointless and empty hope
im selling trumpswallscom want it message me
my familys been in new mexico since the 1550s around therewut talking out of your ass boy
scientifical xray that reads your idthat guy is a complete dumbass he doesnt even know what the fuck hes talking about lmao
steven crowder should invite turd flinging monkey on his show change my mind
we ought to build a wall and we ought to go back to primarily giving status to european nations for immigration when america was running smoothly this is how things were done what benefit is it to the us to stream in millions more unskilled workers welfare deadbeats and career criminals thats all you get when you take in people from low iq average populations were not getting the next nobel prize winners were getting ms13 some nannies and some janitors
sure allow everyone in give them an easy path to citizenship then tax the hell out of them all the while making them eligible for every government assistance program under the sun  im quite positive that thatll be a way to secure our nations fiscal future
the argument that illegals bring money into the economy is ridiculous they cost way more than they bring
will somebody tell me how illegals pay taxes
i want to know what him and his mastermind individuals come up with this should be good
you could probably actually do immigration on a blockchain
understand but not quite on board with the woman who cearly gives a shit about her  neighborhood but the random mexican whos the clearly on coke can suck a broken needle
that second guy was super stupid no walls but xrayd everywhere he needs a mastermind group to think well he needs to get his own mind together first 
x ray border confirmed
you blurred out the first ladys face but i can still make out her face and some of her name on her name tag
we need to build a wall to keep the titans out
i dont think people understand what the wall is the mexican guy said he wanted a xray gate instead you cant have a 2000 mile long gate lol seems like people think its a wall without any doors or gates its so stupid there already is a wall in place its called a fence and it would work the same way as it has already done if it were to be replaced with a different material
that dude would struggle to govern his next sht let alone new mexico
i like his angleinstead of a wall shoot people with xrays and track their movements electronically thats not more terrifying or anythingbut why stop there you should also have drones to just shoot criminals from the sky xray showed illegal drugs bam 2 in the head at the border
build that fuckin wall   trump1
these are the most retarded response
the first woman is a great example of why legal immigration is great she may not agree to build the wall like me but she likes to sit down and have an honest conversation she even wants to deport illegal immigrants and keep the american dream alive great to see these kinds of immigrants
trump pardons el chapo and have el chapo pay for the wall
steven how can you hold a straight face good job at being compassionate and respectful i am sure i would have stopped the conversation at 447
1032 watch crowders reaction to the xray idea his eyebrows say wait what
you need to cite your sources you idiot  how did you get illegals commit 37 of homicides  no respect on this one how can i share if youre also talking without citing
does someone have a link to the crime statistic he mentioned
i support euthanasia of the dumb
what the hell are you parents and schools doing to these kids brains
xray border i mean with the way technology is heading hes not too far off
i disagree with the wall because of how expensive it is and how impractical it is i mean once its built itll probably stump illegals for a couple of years but theyll find a way to get passed it im sure of it
that guy from new mexico seems like a nice polite respectful guy so i am going to be nice here and not state the obvious about his ideasbut damn it if he isnt advocating for some sort of insane big brother type world microchipping people have them walk through xray machines as they move about and have them give written explanations about where they are going and why they are going there genius
arent you the guy who said what if someone has a ladder
that spanish dude had to be on his 5th coffee and 4th linehe is pinging
1st one was some real shit
dude you should not have shown that woman asking how to report those hoods bad form bra
as a non american i have a question isnt there already a physical barrier in place like a fence or something and people still get in not sure how building a wall will make any difference
im not mexican im spanish my family has been there since the 1550s hohoho this dick is more mexican than tacos this guy is the kind of person you cant have inmigrating because he will never be american he thinks hes spanish hohohoho im spanishi find it helarious
id like to see someone who disagrees that actually knows what theyre talking about those are the best change my mind segments
i got an ad for your last change my mind on this video
what 424 we might find some areas where we disagree versus finding areas we disagree
well that was retarded
so were supposed to implant a chip into citizens of a foreign country so our xray wall can track them
im a trump supporter but i think the wall is stupid and there are better ways to keep illegals them out
that spaniard needs to cut back on the caffeineor whatever hes on slow down buddy and actually think before you speak
so slavery more or less putting trackers on people
this guy is super smartuh
lmao build the wall with your ass bith
second guy just assumed doing all of this tech bullshit is easy lmao
i love you guys but i am seriously considering suing this channel for personal injurylistening to that guys insane incoherent ramblings had to have caused my iq to drop by several points particularly his misuse of various words how the hell can an answer be blatant and the part about pharmaceuticals
props to gary johnson for breaking the glass ceiling for retards running for office im sure even this guy could become governor if johnson can
this guy in some of that drug he was talking about saying things from the future like xray border and checkpoints hes in 2099
yo dude blur the lady more bro
steven please come back to canada at least for a while we are experiencing a political nightmare here and need you help
wow just wow  405  and this guy should not be able to vote 
man id like to see this same topic but in albuquerque nm and see what people around here say i live here and hearing some of the beliefs of the people here makes me feel like they dont know whats really happening
this is what gringos do not understand illegal immigrants are more afraid of narco traffickers and the corrupt mexican government looks the other way hence why they are coming here illegally fix the problems over there my step cousins from northern mexico who have came here legally said the sole reason they came to the states was because of the narco violence and corrupt mexican government
second guy trys hard to sound intelligent but he is spitting out bullshit and going off topic
this is why we have electoral votes cant trust idiots to elect the right people
does anyone have a source for undocumented people committing 37 of homicides
lol i got a crowder ad on this video
if he puts another a at the end of another word im gonna
i understand most come because they want a better life if youre lucky but i just dont think its fair for those trying to come in legally then  also that lady is snitching some truth that no one wants to hear about how the legal immigrants have to live in fear
best way to fight immigration is to end the welfare state
two words xray wall
my god that guy is an idiot bless you for not squaring up and slapping him right across his dumb head
scientifical
the second person is a fucking moron
please do this segment agian on a diffrent place that guy dosent know what he talking about  the lady called ice after this hahahaha
we need to build the wall 100ft into the ground and 100ft into the air with 20ft in front of it a 10ft deep pool of water drones patrolling 247 and at the top of the wall lethally electrified razor wire
listening to the future governor of new mexico made me feel dumber
what surprised me the most about this change my mind was the short length of stevens shorts
i just cringe at these videos anymore there is no hope lets just go to war they wouldnt even know how to load a gun
yeah here in new mexico we are a sanctuary city leroy new mexico is a state not a city haha
i cringed so hard at this
how do you tolerate sitting across from people like that second guy
if your illegal you dont nasally bring drugs if you bring drugs your likes a illegal thats how it works
miss when you did the hour long change my minds
why are people hating on the last guyxd i think hes a visionary hes thinking way ahead of most people and so that confuses people and makes them think hes crazy in reality hes ideas are incomplete but they are not entirely implausible hes perfectly right in the future traditional borders as we know them will become obsolete so their will have to be a way to track people leaving or entering a territory
despite the fact that illegal aliens make it up to 3of us population they commit 37 homicides and despite the fact that black population make it up to 13 population they commit half of the homicides mostly black on black crimesfact dont care about your feelings
no wall no country
that guy kind of half way described the process of coming here legally lol is he on drugs
these people sound retarded af
because it wont work and is thus a waste of money
remove her id tag ffs man
yay for microchipping
im spanish not mexicania 56 abominacin
what the fuck was the second dude saying  it makes embaressed that im the same race as this guy god damn he made us look bad 
did anyone check that guys id ha ha and he wants to run for public officexray party maybe huh who do i report these people to again
whats even bad about the wall
we need the wall to keep the honest people honest or anyone cought border jumping shot on site who is that dumbass guy he gonna get us all killed
ur a piece of shit youll get bigk x
wow that guy was a complete moron
leroy plans to run for governor of new mexico somedayno bueno
steven looks good in those short shorts change my mind
building the wall will cost billions of dollars which we could use instead as part of a comprehensive plan to reduce illegal immigrants from the source by legalizing drugs creating a bounty program for turning them in and getting tens of millions illegals that arent felonious criminals citizenship we dont want to end up like japan in a 10 year recession because of closed borders and falling birth rates
spanish that idiot is nothing but another ignorant uneducated paisa who barely speaks the english language lmfao spaniards are light skinned gavachos pendejo youre as dark as me hahaha
the xray border that auto tracks everyone and they send a note to space as to why theyre breaking the law then they get instant citizenship and can do whatever they want rape women murder its ok
sooooo the second guy wants to implement a totalitarian surveillance based government ok
hey at least the ethnic denier made a good point those who want a dystopian totalitarianism future are clueless and quite dangerous in this day and age of everyone is equal ffs
rip xxx
that death from above 1979 tee  yes
the cringe is real
build the wall why the hell not
lets have everyone implanted with a chip and have drones constantly flying over scanning people and life forms any human lifeforms that show up without a chip will be grabbed from the sky like the hook game that grabs stuffed animals   problem solved
thisleroy dude is definitely retarded speaks like realitys peter griffin xray spy machine and all
oh man steven your patience always astounds me  that second guys moronic ramblings drove me crazy in the first two minutes
i have no more family in mexico my family did it legally and came over here years ago im against all these entitled illegals as are most of us dont let the media fool you do it legally or get the fuck out of here
lets be honest this is about changing theyre minds
crowder debating low hanging fruit this is really getting stale
is the process of legal immigration fair serious question im not from the us
hes talking to idiots
how about a lazer wall call it the thanos wall it only allows 50 of people in the other 50 is turned to dust
didnt rome collapse from taxation of the sers cuasing citizens ot ahve uproar as becasue the benefit of beign a slave was untaxed but couldnt be a citizen hmmm strange world one should never support full tiem tax system it breaks down communication centralisation 
this showed how ignorant these people are
the first one made me sad
if she is that scared  why not blur her whole body and maybe even change her voice why not go the extra mile to make sure there is nobody from her hood that can be like oh shit that is ms  i mean if your from austin and you live next to this lady that little blur is not going to help much  that purse she probably walks around with everydayyou want to protect these people as much as possible granted there are probably not a ton of people from her neighborhood that listen to your show but why not go full james bond on the hiding her identity thing look she could owe the loan sharks money and be like how do i get rid of those dudes but it doesnt really matter  changing the voice might be hard  but blurring out her whole body shouldnt  at least do that  and im a fan  just saying
uhm that guy from nm is high i am not saying that facetiously he is literally high
im hoping crowder misspoke when he said 37 of murders are committed by illegal immigrants i couldnt find a single source even close to those numbers what i found said non us citizens legal and illegal committed 12 of murders and the source of that claim was poor at best now in curious what the actual percentage is
an xray gate with walls either side sounds like trumps plan but he wants a big golden  gate for legal entry he just wants open borders and thats the end of any nation if you agree to that you may as well disband the army if anyone else can come into your nation armed or not problem is the left thinks in the now about feelings the right think of long term impacts on the economy security and cultural change 
how does one tax someone who virtually doesnt exist document wise
the guy wouldnt mind that illegal immigrants dont wear any id detectable with his xray fence besides the fact that xray isnt a proper type of radiation for this purpose
suspend all immigration for ten years change my mind
god people are dumb
i dont think some can grasp the idea of a wall being more than just steel or concrete  border security you shall not passwithout id
some people are just a special kind of stupid
how do i deport these people wow crowder you are palpatine at this point in time
hes trolling
yea lets just tag everyone in the world jackass
this dude is dumb as a rock and of course hell support open borders for more of his criminal relatives to come to change the demographic in their favor
everytime i watch one of these its always constructed argument vs on the spot opinion one sided af
to start off i really like trump but the wall idea isnt the best way to deal with illegal immigration  i think we could send over the armed forces to mexico and hunt down gangs and destroy crime their  also we could force mexico to create strict laws and donate the money we would use to build the wall to mexico its an investment and if it was to work out well we could totally make mexico into a great place and maybe it would make people want to move there i think the wall is a short term solution for a long term problem
yes fuck yes
good idea good luck with your political career
is that kid real
that spannish dude is talking out his arse
this one guy doesnt have any idea what bee is talking about
heres something ive never understood why do a lot of liberals believe in gun bans but also believe in open boarders  the theory behind gun bans is that by disarming the public there would be a drop in shootings yet by allowing for open boarders you make illegal trade much easier to perform and in a disarmed america there opens up a brand new market for illegal weapons  the two ideas seem incompatible to me
im losing iq
if there are unemployed americans why does america need more workforce from another countrynext thing america will end up like the ukwith unemployed citizens and cheap employed migrantsbut boyarent the bosses happy
1316  my face the entire time leroy talked  go green global activist future governor of new mexico what the hell is creating these orwellian authoritarian collectivists on our soil  you know what it is  that shit needs to be fixed yesterday
leroy wants every citizens move tracked im sure by then freedom of speech would be a thing of the past so privacy is the obvious next thing to go as well
while i agree with some of the points made here this seems like just what we dont need its clear from the beginning that this guy is definitely not gonna change his mind yes some of these people are pretty hysterical but it looks like hes here to prove other people wrong hes constantly interrupting he nods his head but you can tell hes not really listening i dont think this helps our polarization problem he is respectful though ill give him that
congrats on 2 million
that zoomin at the end had me dying
how did crowder keep a straight face when questioning him about the xray border
chips in thier bodies an xray them makes sense beep beep
hey you should hold a online change my mind im a democrat and love your channel becuase it gives me a new view on subjects
the proper scientifical ray is a radio wave and cell phones already do this
ms13 are animals
sew a border made up of possibly trillions of xray scanners all up and down the border that will scan or inject a chip or some kind of tracking system all completely automated how wonderful i dont want to pay for that the wall is already expensive as it is imagine the maintenance fees
so whites came and killed a bunch of indians took their land and i now want to build a wall what you really want to say is we dont want any more brown people in america we want to keep it as white as possible and stop the bleeding
over and over in all these ask a liberal what they think videos on the conservatives channels all of them say that they havent thought it thru its all the proof we need to know that theyre clueless and we need to change their minds or just kick them over the wall
that poor lady i hope something can be done about her situation and i think eventually shell come to want a wall the guy from new mexico was hard to listen to hes clueless alsoi had a hard time hearing the uh sound after every other sentence it wasnt like an uhhh lemme think sound it was just weirduh
leroy was about as coherent as a bum ranting at pigeons about the lizard people
i was waiting for steven to ask xray man about how to stop people from walking around the xray machine if there is no wall
so no wall and open boarders hum is this for america only i do a lot of traveling around the world and every country makes it difficult for me they always want me to have a visa foreign countries insist you have a visa and dont do a overstay can not work with out a work permit basically no workingyou also have to have financial abilities to pay for your entire stay with out the help from foreign government you are on your own no financial helpand you can not just stay as long as you want you have to do boarder crossing and renew your visa you better have all of your papers in order or to jail you go and then kicked out of the country
its so funny how all these people seem to think it should be a free for all here in america but when it comes to theyre country they have a boarder wall with strick imigration laws but us you cant have any laws because we dont want you to stop us from violating and taking advantage of yer country bulled the fuckin wall asap
why have boarders at all no boarders means no countrys so there would never be a war for ground wow just make tax money of everyone that sounds so good mind  blown that dude was so right
i agree build the damn wall come legally or not fucking at all and stop all this asylum bullshit
xray border
srsly they will just jump the walls just like ppl has done since the inception of walls we need a better way to stop the illigals
lobotomies should be totally illegal change my mind  wait
this guy really just shouted himself out and walked away like he just destroyed him lmaooo
stevencrowder when youre a person from mexico or any other border country trying to escape extreme political violence and suffering in your own country the next best option is to find hope across the border and into the us they dont have time to sit around and be patient with paper work and look up the legal laws otherwise its too late for most of them at a point of life and death but yall wouldnt know that because all youre told is how important it is to secure the us from dangerous illegals which is such a false stereotype you know youre privileged when you advocate for a wall because you dont know what its like for them to simply try and escape corruption under the suffering conditions they are in
i would agree with the mexican dude with taxing everyone that comes here in exchange for citizenship the problem is they would take advantage with their children and collect government assistance which we would pay for but it would be legal and the taxes they pay wouldnt come close to covering what they collect from tax payers
the only way for people to realize the wall should have been built would be to let all of the illegal immigrants who commit the murders and live without a contribution to this country come in and do what they do best then get the guns to push them back its that simple if the wall is too much for people to handle then build doors in the wall that come both ways and only open with qualified access id tagging and stuff like the way the mexican guy is state of the art technology we wont have for another 100 or so years
youll need to do a part two to this one maybe a different location
the wall is a huge waste of money theyre going to get in somehow how about we use that money for education
leroiii high as shiiitt lmao
you have no idea
damn i wish i could sit down and discuss this stuff but i live in the uk i my opinion though the wall would be a huge waste of money as many illegal immigrants actually enter the country via planes and boats or inside legally traveling trucks and then overstay their welcome therefore i believe that while immigration control is important the wall would be ineffective a good case study is the uk as we have lots of illegal immigrants and as we are an island we essentially have a wall formed by the ocean many statistics ive seen actually suggest that many immigrants use the border to return home and so a wall may actually prohibit people leaving america thus adding to the immigration problem
future governor of new mexico right there
i agree with thanos decision change my mind
crowder so you dont want a wall what would you do insteadspanish dude proposes the most hellish parts of every dystopian world ever conceived
steven he has to be the most incoherent person youve interviewed i came back on just to comment because my mind is still in wtf mode an hour later
37 doubt it build the wall with drone towers tho
we might find some areas where we disagree vs areas where we disagree  steven crowder 2018
never go full retard
we all know that the wall will never be done
youll have to do this one again maybe in another location  it was a bust
im an observer and those people doing those things was great d i mean camps separateing children not letting people in because they dont where the same pants imagine a really drunk guy talking to you only half noticeing what he says uhh anyways you gotta see the big picture
build the fucking wall
people who do cocaine do that tongue thing a lot 415
a wall worked great for china great defense over open border keeps out tb chagas leprosy polio measles and a lot of other diseases that are showing up in our elementary schools illegals dont pay taxes their employers take it out and dont report it a scanner still needs a wall to direct people to it the drug war wastes millions to keep the price up to make billions all cartels send there profits to ny banks they only get to keep a  the cia owns them didnt we learn that with g bush sr and iran contra
me and my mother were naturalized on 2013 from russia after over 6 years of getting by to get approved and i watched my mother break down and cry as she put her hand on her heart and told mewe made it you are taking a shit on my story and millions of other people by giving your vote for destroying the process you need to earn your right to call yourself an american because we dont understand the value of antything that you havent done anything to earn and btw my mom became a nurse and then an administrator making over 140000 a year just in 6 year and she had to learn english i got ba and ma and i teach in the projects in chicago south side i cant say i would have this successfulif i ran here and was given free shit and didnt gain a positive feeling of actually appreciating and loveing this country    you silence or never speak stories of naturalized normal immigrants because we refused to be a victim respected the nation that finally gave us opportunities we never would have had back home whats going on with this country you can fight and call other people for people like me because we have worked and spend out time and adapted to make it here and be successful i dont need your pity and i dont call myself opressed no more heed these stories but all of this was probably white privilige you really shit on the work we had to do by being unable to separate your feelings from simple principles that willakethis coutnry great i look and i see many americans just loose the appreciation and love and respect this country seone probably made you believe you were socially orpessed or a victim and you gullibly went with it
hahahathis guy doesnt make any senseno wall but some sort of entry port build that wall trump
the mexican guy sounds like a 6 year old playing monopoly and winning somethings in it and they saying its time to call my real estate manager to take advice on my new property ideas
im neither republican or democrat but for me the wall has two things about it that really make me angry the first is that it goes against everything i was taught to believe in immigration we were taught the good the bad and the ugly about it all through history this country was built on the backs of immigrants  we even had school house rock teach us this between cartoons the second reason is i was stationed in germany when the berlin wall fell i was there for a world of emotions families were tore apart and finally brought together so thats a strong memory
a magic x ray wall it will automatically tag a person who crosses the border maybe the harry potter will set it up lol
this hispanic kid wants to be governor of the city of new mexico isnt this dummy also brainstorming that the illegals could be made to take the mark of the beast lol
where was this interview done no where near the border states lol
there is literally no good argument against securing the border via the wall or other solid barrier unless youre an anarchist or globalist
huge xrays that scan people hmmlike for broken boneswould they be sexy nurses too lol
that mexican immigrant woman is the epitome of a lowinformation voter no wonder the dems want more immigration
i dont support the walli have a cheaper solutionmine fields with project metal storm guarding our borders and other military area of denial weaponsplay survivor the real gamemake it into the country great your path to citizenship begins with deployment in the american foreign legion heres your rifle heres your camo get on the plane
this idiot in the white t shirt doesnt even have a spanish accent and his family lived in nm since way before he was born so he should speak proper english his halfitalian fake accent is so ridiculous just speak the queens d
what the hell was that guy talking about i think his argument broke more constitutional rights than a wall ever could
illegal immigrants cost america 135 billion annually and they only pay into it 19 billion
not gay looked like a badass
once the discussion was how to uphold the law now its seriously being debated if we should uphold the law
congrats on 2million subscribers man i joined before the 500k days lol
im all in favor of increasing border security but i dont believe a physical wall will actually stop them the amount of money needed to build this wall could go towards other means of security perhaps a gauntlet of laser and seismic sensors calibrated to detect people crossing the border a mile wide zone that tracks anyone on it and beams the info real time to border patrol a wall wouldnt stop people from tunneling under but seismic sensors would detect and pinpoint diggers
dont try to analyze what the guy is saying hes just not very smart lmao im sure hes a perfectly nice guy but hes absolutely stupid
earing man was talking about one world govmt and mark of the devil we can like travel anywhere like super fast and cheap how about a um electronic like chip
intriguing conversation but a dreamer in the end
visually we dont want to be walled in thats the biggest fear
im spanish not mexican my family has been here since 1550 sure they have buddy
that man with the camera had to try to turn it around to make it his showhe doesnt know what he is saying but he has a passion for it
that poor mans brain shorted out after simple logic was introduced
his face at the end oh my goodness
not gay jareds fanny pack looks fabulousssss
are you having problems with crime and jails are overpopulated no problem just make it legal  no crime no problem
geez that lady is exactly what happens to people that immigrate here legally  they get robbed burglarized and victimized by the illegals
that little stare into the camera like hes on the office 
i just had an awesome advertisement of ben shapiro educating us on the cringe of the leftists sexist viewsit was a very long ad and i watched the whole thing 
im actually a bit afraid the lady is not blurred enough she might be in a very dangerous situation
watching leroy was like watching me and my friends get high and talk about shit we dont understand but because were high were both like yooo ive worked out immigration bro
that guy has the dankest weed in the world lmfao an xray wall
oo my initial reaction lets see
scientifical ray
hey i kind of agree with you but i do not support a wall the money and resources that would be used in a wall could be better used in another way to better the lives of people disaster relief is underfunded last summer 1295959 acres burned here in montana houses burned down smoke made caused health problems for a majority of the people in the state the federal government refused to step in and help the fires raged on until the snow fell this spring the water levels raised and caused flooding yet again the federal government did not step in to help the people of montana a good portion of the state flooded 3 houses in frenchtown montana were lost to the clark fork river the amount of devastation we have endured in the last year has been insane
build that wall unfortunately its gonna be paid by the taxpayers
guys they come here illegally its ok tho we can just tax them problem solved111111111111111111111111111111111111
they dont want to build a wall they want to keep track of illegals and im assuming they want police interaction yea like they arent already in the spotlight
areas where we disagree vs areas we disagree
can we get that dude with the camera a drugtest fucker is just rambling s
im a englishman because at one point there were british immigrants in this country
change my mind is a great show but low iq people are a waste of time
i can not come up with an answer now id have to sit down and think about it 5 minutes laterive been thinking a lot about this in the last three years he must have been xrayed too many times
republicans conservatives puritans evangelists christians traditional and morale groups are the samesht that the nazi supporters said and did when they started to loss the warto save them selfs from retaliation for there hate racism bigotry elitist white power movement and went underground waiting for another insecure incompetent illiterate bigot racist elitist white power sympathizer low life like this father mother and uncle
i looked up the thing steven crowder said about 35 percent of all homicides being cause by illegals that is absolute bullshit theres only a few states such as texas that look into immigration status when looking someone up past being a citizen or non citizennon citizens who commit felonies are automatically striped from residency and deported so most states only look into if someone is a citizen or non citizen steven crowder lumps non citizen legal immigrants such as residents green card holders or visa workers with non citizen illegals in fact texas which is one of the only states that keeps separate stats for legal and illegals has a criminality rate for illegals of between 5 to 15 percent on most yearssteven crowder is full of shit
that spanish guy talks like hes constantly out of breath
i hope that first lady stays safe yikes praying for her lol
nice respectful dude but holy shit i did not understand a damn thing he just said
a wall blocking the sight of snipers using an hs50 to shoot people inside their appartment and a checkpoint where you say hello to people while second guy proposes to tag all human beings like animals in wild life migration studies and radiate them at an invisible line where you see no walllike the invisible fence where dogs get an electroshock if they come to close  the nonwall solution is inhumain totalitarian i prefer the inconvenience to say at the entrydoor hello i am
xray borders g
the spawns of college education
that guy in white shirt made no sensehow do you suppose to tax illegal immigrants if you dont know where they are and who they are
steven if you want more ammo for your arsenal why not look into mexicos immigration laws
traps are gay change my mind
lol the spanish guy is pretty much saying mexican immigrants should be dog tagged
that look at the end tho like wtf did i just listen to lmao
xray border
leroy was fantastic xd
oh first guy is retarded been in new mexico since the 1550s yeah no
i dont know how you could even carry on with the second guy for as long as you did my god it was like in 5th grade when the teacher called on the kid who could barley read
not sure if anyone already mentioned this in a comment but around the 528 mark when talking about illegal immigrant crime percentages the true statistic is 100 of illegal immigrants are criminals that is stated in the term illegal immigrantsthis whole debate is just too hard for us americans to come together and solve there are just too many people thinking with their heart and emotions rather than using logic yes generally 99 of people in the world are good hearted people but even a rapist can be a good hearted person 99 of the time spending several years in el paso texas i saw first hand the problems with illegal immigration and the issues law enforcementcommunityborder patrol dealt with on a daily basis i also spent time in pittsburgh and new york where the situation of illegal  immigrants is not so prevalent as on the southern border with that said i see how hard it is for a majority of the country not living close to land based borders to be so empathetic to these people and cant possibly comprehend the real issues our country is having with this whether you think with your heart or your head go visit a local homeless person or veteran and decide if their life is less important than somebody that trespassed into this country  if we would have a little more compassion in our heart for the american population struggling now and use a little more logic in dealing with the people that side stepped the law we could solve both problems just food for thought where would 5 go further mexico or usa wouldnt the solution be for us figuring out how to provide more foreign aid to foreign poverty stricken areas rather than looking the other way when a poor illegal migrant sneaks into a higher cost of living area
my iq dropped just by trying to comprehend what the last guy was saying 
its actually scary to see how dumb that guy from new mexico was like you can actually get that dumb  imagine having his kids
im not mexican im spanish new mexico used to be mexico and youre brown af homie you mexican lol grew up with so many fools like this thinking theyre spanish news flash homes spanish peole are euripian they consider themselves white
ehh im not against it my parents went through so many long years of fighting to become citizens in this country i dont think others should be able to just be here for free especially if they dont even put in effort to become part of the country but the nationalization process should be made easier and cheaper because most likely these people have nothing and can barely provide for their own familys even shelling out thousands of dollars that they dont have there is a good chance that you will still get denied citizenship and deported but i do believe in immigration reform but the us should pay for the wall and stop asking for mexico to pay for it if you want a damn wall then pay for it im not going to build a fence around my house and then ask my neighbor to pay it for me thats just stupid
immigration wasnt a big deal until we started asking for our rights the big companies got together and started spreading propaganda just like they did with weed most of you hating have never even had real interactions with us  sucks because most of my views are conservative and here youre spreading this narrative that were criminals and you should fear us
this guy said he had a show anyone found it yet
the new mexico guy speaks like a legitimately retarded person
i appreciate that the guy from new mexico sat down to have a conversation  but the whole xray wall is dumb not only would this be even more expensive the maintenance costs would  be worse than a standard wall  and even if we did put in a more free flowing border people who are willing to break international law as freely as illegal aliens do dont deserve to be in this country whether they are germans french english spanish or frenchcanadian
this dude from new mexico dude go home your drunk
they pushing for people to go into america rather than pushing for a change in their home country
woah wait a minute that first lady is clearly scaredi myself am a legal immigrant and ive been fortunate enough to be raised in a good suburban area in north houston but i can only imagine what that woman goes through she should not feel scared like that in her apartment complex i hope she reported those assholes and got them the hell out of this country
i got a wish donald trump a happy bday ad
it just depends on what your end goal is increasing legal immigrants or stopping it entirely
why dont we just build a nice wall of condos all the way across the southern border 
big fan of crowder however i gotta disagree with him on this one instead of building a wall we should allocate all these sources into fixing this broken immigration system of ours building a wall would be more of a short term solution not a long term one
this dude is the poster child of why drugs are bad
no borders only xray ones
mr pink mangina shorts gave a compelling argument  he needs to be on the other side of the wall before we build it
why do people automatically turn themselves into tagged cattle
oh cool another video that youtube doesnt even list for me and during the course of just opening this video youtube used their auto quality to ddos me twice thanks net neutrality
stop massaging your ego an actually debate people who know what theyre talking aboutlike when that kid destroyed on communismi could probably destroy you on anti wall even though im pro wall
leroy trujillo is a complete jackass lmao
why do a lot of these comments not have any thumbs up i thought we all agree we should build a wall right come on guys 80 of women crossing the border get raped by coyotes in one of gavins debates he said that and someone couldnt even have a debate with him they just walked away ever since then i have thought we definitely need a wall for that and many other reasons
no dont build a wall but im fine with implanting micro chips and scanners everywhere to track each individual person makes total sense
this is uncanny i just got into it on facebook about illegal immigrants i had people trying to say that crossing the border wasnt actually a crime and that they are simply seeking asylum i quickly pointed them the united states standards for asylum seekers in which it say in order to qualify you have to meet their definition of a refugee which the people crossing the border do not meet
huh so illegals get to go on the fast lane while legals have to wait get the fuck outta here
im so confused when deffending our borders became such a crime to the left
we should build a wall on the canadian border and through this guy back over it
he said 35 percent of homicides are committed by illegals i call bullshit on that
building a wall will be a waste of money eventually taken out of our taxes somehow building it will be seriously worthless and after a few years people will find a way of getting over it or thru it please remember that mexico is our neighbor and stopping them from coming in illegally is impossible best thing to do is make it harder for them to come in by securing borders better and adding more security and actual human reinforcement not a wall the government should imply to everyone how important a border patrol job is and make it easier cheaper and more accessible for the young generation to become a border patrol officer because security is what is needed not a stupid wallyes i do feel like what i wrote is good and i stand by it but i still keep in mind that this country was created by immigrants and americans are not the founders of this land and almost half of the us was once mexican land the us needs to stop seeing mexicansillegals as negatives just because of a small percentage of them commit crimes if that is the case all crackheads and druggies should also be deported or incarcerated for life because they also damage our country reinforcement is the key
the pinchazo mezican is why we need a disease
i also dont agree how trump is calling mexicans rapists and stuff because theres rapists everywhere so to say that mexicans are rapsists and murderers are unfair if u pretend to put russia where mexico is right now the exact same thing would happen im making this point because i feel like trump is targeting just mexicans even though anyone would come to the us if they were close enough and im sure there are immigrants who come to the us and commit crimes i could be wrong but i dont think that people get deported if your from lets just say sweden and commit a crime
im against the wall because of the money that would cost to tax payers because i dont believe mexico will pay it if mexico will really pay it than build it so the idiotic corrupt government of mexico feels shame if that wall will make the mexican and central american countries wake up the to really change the ways of its corrupt culturegovernment but i dont think thats going to happen i think we should hire more law enforcement officers that also arent corrupt i leave near the border in the us side and know many criminals that i dont necessarily agree with but grew up together in schools neighbor hoods etc and know for a fact that alot of border patrol are corrupt they bring the drugs in and also know a person who received weapons from   a border patrol on the mexican side they cross it through the mountains because nobody will ever say anything so i also believe that is something to be fixed in our government and we here about el chapobut do they ever catch drug lords from the us instead of focusing on building a wall that will not prevent anything from coming if corruption on the american side isnt delt with  maybe instead of border patrol have more military also drugs and people cross illegaly through the port of entry as well  many time with the authorization of us customs corruption is the problem there as well i say invest that money in removing sanctuary city laws really looking for illegal criminals in all neighbor hoods we need more law enforcement budget to really help build a better law enforcement around the country and in sanctuary cities enforcement with abiding laws from the federal government and not the state government all with respect no hard feelings just business get criminals out but help hard working  people and students get there legal status and pay taxes so the clintons bank doesnt get slimmer lolif they do build it ill make sure to put a taco stand as the ones building it will be hispanics hahahahaha what an irony also remove welfare ill guarantee lazy people all over the place  will do the work that illegal immigrants do that nobody else wants to do to avoid dying of hunger
lmao that guys ideas
do they realize we have a fence up already its more of a reinforce the fence idea
x ray border for 2020
please do a part 2 on this it needs to be discussed more because a lot of people are being led by their noses from the liberal media do it on a college campus teach the truth to the youth
who trusts that guys ability to track his ancestors back to the 1550s with any accuracy
the amount of people that think building a wall means there will be absolutely no way to get in or out of the country is kind of sad shows how misinformed the left is
im against the wall but these people had the worst arguments and no facts to support them it was very dissapointing
the wall is gonna be built this is not going to be a dumping ground for illegals no more fuck you illlegals and the cartel you rode in on
did i just became stupider
damn shes dead
wow trujillo just described a modern version of checkpoint charlie a 21st century version of the soviet unions border polices and our favorite the modern equivalent of the nazi show us your papers
i am a south african and i would love to become a american but i would never ever think of going there illegaly
stay in drugs dont do school right
literally couldnt watch the video this guy was so dumb
ok so building the wall would be devastating to our american economy even if we some how in fairy tale land get mexico to pay for the construction of the wall we as americans citizens will have to pay for maintaining the wall the wall itself is a very expensive and unattainable concept we would have to go through so many homes uneasy terrains and other limiting factors throughout the border land the border between mexico and america is not flat grassland ready to be build on im not even going to go into the need for a circular flow because that is more controversial than the factualness of price and limitations
bro the second guy is from the future to solve the immigration crisis
they take the whole keep austin weird thing pretty serious huh
ah the x ray wallor as i like to call it the cancer wall
i want a wall build like the one in the movie 300
since mexico is a hot topic issue for immigration i would like to see any possible cooperation between the us and mexico possibly help with the crime there through us military im not sure if this would help but its probably better than a corrupt and broken government
i agree with everything u believe in steven except the wall i would love to have the wall but only if people can visas much faster its easy for me to sit here and say well just wait the month then but people in mexico can not afford to wait for that month cuz they have children to feed and bills to pay i understand your point and i totally get it but i think there should be a compromise
youre all ass holes he looks like he has an impairment at least he tried i like how steven crowder handled him self respectfully i believe we should have a fence like we have now and they should lower the cost of citizenship give the ones who want to do good a chance if they cant afford it give them time to save money to afford it with work visas but dont make it so expensive
that guy had me in tears 
new mexico is screwed if that young man becomes governor get out and vote people
no no wall just an xray wall
lmao i wouldnt hesitate to report illegals
what are the odds of finding two people on the same street corner who were both dropped on their heads as infants weird
my concern is that walls can be used to contain people as easily as they keep people out and the last thing america needs is a berlin wall scenariothe other major concern is cost we cant afford major public works projects until the damned federal state and local overspending is under controli think a more reasonable path to border security is to initiate crowdsourced security set up a system of cameras along the border that live stream to paid subscribers of the program each camera stream can be viewed by any subscriber at any time and multiple users can view the same stream the subscription revenue say 1mo per simultaneous stream if you have multiple monitors each looking at a different stream each costs you 1mo so 10 separate streams would be 10mo total would likely encourage more people to try it and generate revenue for covering operation costs and installationthe viewers can report illegal crossing through the stream interface to prevent false flagging reports being sent the report would be checked to see if other viewers are reporting within the same time if it appears that its valid in that many different people are reporting itll send a report to the nearest volunteer security team minutemen if you will the minutemen who have registered as volunteer civilian border security will respond to the report on their own dimeas an incentive for the minutemen to handle captured immigrants humanely and to properly turn them over to immigration services the minutemen must video document each capture and at the end of the year the top 10 of minutemen groups will be exempt from paying any federal taxes that year as a thanks for their servicethere would also be two groups of captures captures that are clearly people who dont intend to assimilate into american culture and law such as drug runners thugs or just anyone who doesnt speak english fluently enough to be understood and those who seem like promising candidates for citizenship theyve learned english seem otherwise law abiding despite crossing illegally and appear willing to do honest work the candidate group can be granted asylum as long as they have a volunteer sponsor who will not only endorse them for citizenship but also foot the bill for the paperwork this will allow charity organizations to form who wish to help people legally become citizens and said charities must also document the people they help on their own dime charities will be reviewed every 3 years and if their candidates  now turned citizen  are staying out of crime the charitys staff will be exempt from federal taxes for the next 3 yearsthis system is far more realistic and cost effective than spending trillions on a wall and federal border security staff and will likely yield a much better outcome for all parties involved save for the drug runners and thugs by having nearly the whole operation civilian operated cost is kept down and the people maintain power over the border not the government a check against tyrannywhat do you guys thinkwhat would you changeadd and why
do this one again please
last guy made my head hurt
damn steven your the man for sitting through that one well done
that leroy guy just pissed me off lmao
what the fk is an emigreen
love the flow
this guy watches too many cartoons
stevencrowder im a deported veteran currently living in the dominican republic i have been threw a lot i have seen a lot based on my bad decision i was a legal alien resident since 1979 i oath in the united states marines corps from 20002005 got a bad conduct discharged just little back story and  like any other right afforded by the us constitution voluntary defended by me you can form your own opinion of me based on this information but just to be clear a non violent criminal act was committed on my part i was charge with fraud for uncovering and also trying to beat the system of recruit gear issues on parris island the reason of my deportation which was 27 years later was crime or moral turpitude if you do read this i share a lot of your points of view and this is one them being a legal immigrant either or not falling threw the cracks of a flawed system because as the government sends out a lot of bad people they also look away when they come in i can tell you about my own experience in the deportation process and my story conclusion im progun malefemale is the best foundation and building on patriotism it does not matter which country it is should be the number one responsibility of any citizen of zed country  thank you
i could tell steven was trying not to lose his shit when the guy said fucking xray wall
can we call the people who watch over the xray border xmen
he wants to be new mexicos governor and he been thinking about it for the past 3 years and an xray and written notice is what he came up with but no boarder and no wall
i think building the wall change my mind is an issue you should tackle again come this september
the upside of open borders is that when the country dissolves it will solve the national debt problem
did he just do the jim halpert face in the end 
will ms13 be able to join the space force p
a few mastermind individuals  would have to figure it out smh pure idiocy
x ray borders and masterminds lmaosteven let that train run right off the rails
that first woman is very bright
xray cringe fest
you heard it here first boarders will be gone in the next 510 yearsi guarantee if that happened it wouldnt be in the everyone holding hands and singing way you are thinking
leroya likes to end his sentencesa with an a
i want a moat with gators
lol that guy was higher then he thought he would be or if he was handicap my bad either way i was entertained
new mexico is a sanctuary city huh sounds worse than the england is my city guy canada switzerland and germany are great states north america is a great county and mars is a great continent
in episode 306 you said this binder would be on sale at some point how do we get it
xrays  confucius
please have this discussion again with someone who can spell his own name not because i disagree with you but because putting mentally disabled people up on yt for laughs is not very nice  granted that itll be hard to find a triple digit iq who disagrees
crowder sometimes makes me cringe because he just tells people straight up lol
build the wall with your ass bitch 
lets just make mexico the 51st state and clean out their swamp and then we can tax them and then when justin comes begging for help we got 52
i think we should tighten up the border and monitor who takes flights from south america or anywhere else more carefully a wall would be way too expensive and i dont want the american tax payer money to go towards that when there are police and firefighters out there who depend on this money if a wall could be built for significantly less money then go for it but for now many illegals come by airplanes so what use would an expensive wall be
youre right we shouldnt waste money building the wall when we got drones we can just drone strike the illegals trying to come in
dear mr future governor of new mexico umm wow where do i start so no wall cause thats bad but an xray wall is the ticket huh ummm ok so who tags these people in the beginning so they can be tracked mexico
cocaines a hell of a drugartem goat lobov
what a strange lady
you posted a video solely interviewing mentally  ill people
could someone post sources with facts concerning illegals and crimes couldnt find reliable stuff
the laws and the wall should be there to protect me and my family from crime child traffickingsex trafficking drugs the loss of jobs the loss of quality of life taken by the ileagal alians it is important to restrict the flow so as to get good representatives from other countries not there worst we must get them to asymulate to us not change america to there culture the argument that it is in human to send children back is biased and wrong in america if a citizen breaks the law they are separated from there families for jail time the parents that send there children here without family should be held accountable for inhumane behavior and bad parenting the originating countries of these children are responsible for them not america if the originating country can not do so humanly then the children would have reason for asylum build that wall
this is the united states of america we have laws if you want to come here there is a way for you to do it if you come here  legally and get separated from your children you are a dumbass for coming here illegally we dont have to change your mind you have to change ours the problem is were not about to change our mind as far as im concerned if youre such a shity parent that you are going to take your children into another country knowing that they will be taken from you why would you go there do you not love your children do you not care about your children or do you really believe that you can flip america the finger and just do what you want the screwed up thing is our government continues letting these people into the country stop them at the border force them to sign a statement in english and their own language that states if they come back here illegally ever again they will be prosecuted and executed do the humane thing and send them back to mexico well actually they would not make it into our country so just leave them in mexico and let the mexican government take care of them if they die at the border its because mexico would not help them if the children died at the border because they dont have food or water thats because the mexicans would not give them any food or water see you idiots have no problem with mexico flipping them the finger but its american slipped in the finger well were racist to every democrat socialist nazi transgender or otherwise screwed up in the head person out there i say screw you all and if you dont like america get the f out
build the wall up your asshowliterally how
leroy is sweet yet so lostlike a puppy
that leroy idiot is clearly as indigenous as the rest of mexicans but hes like 506 like im not mexican im spanish im from spain my familys been in new mexico since the 1550s hes a delusional and clearly intellectually challenged for sure
the first guy is so futuristicjust so happened to be the only guy lol
lol id chips eh  how about ear tags moooo
today i heard someone say scientifical unironically
one of his relatives came from spain almost 500 years ago and he calls himself spanish lol
forget governor the second guy should become a a sci fi writer xrays and faster technology everywhere
listening to some of those people makes me cringe so hard
do not click read morei told you not to clickstill going this is your own fault   next time dont click read moreokthere it is over maybe you learned a lesson today
people in the future will be able to travel super fast 
surely there were more able debaters out there that day
future governor of new mexico ladies and gentlemen 
im not mexican im spanish i call bs
you guys should upload a full uncut version
is leroy trolling
at no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you no points and may god have mercy on your soulthat face at the end was priceless man lmao
i find the unquestioned embrace of spending billions of tax money disconcerting from a conservative perspective  the wall should be fine as long as there is careful study of cost tax money encroachment of private properties vs result decrease in illegal entries to justify spending the money
leroy for president
wow i didnt realize that people were so incredibly unintelligent  unreal how completely clueless that nm dude is smh  steven how did you have the patience to sit there and listen to that  lol
 that last guys ideas were way more extreme than a simple wall if trump suggested it hed be attacked and rightly so
my god some people are just simply simple minded xray border wtf
change my mind shows arent very interesting when crowder interviews complete idiots
these guys always talk very fast like shapiro and milo
that lady saw build a wall and a table and thought it was an ice report and deport booth 
dammit leroy
good work you didnt blur that womans id card
that guy seemed like he never thought about immigration before and onthespot just started coming up with nonsensical solutions to a problem that doesnt understand hed make a great politician
lmao that mexican trying to say hes a spaniard im not mexican im spa  my family have been in mexico since the 1550slmao im pretty sure even the spaniards and italians that migrated to argentina in the past 200 years are now still considered as argentinians not italians lmao the bloke looks more mexican than danny trejo lmao hes got those asian eyes that the native americans have he clearly has never seen a spaniard before
i really hate when people come in acting like they know everything but they completely clueless
that guy made zero sense my brain hurts now
its sad how brainwashable people really aremost people are literally against the wall only bc its be given a negitive view and nothing more the media can push something so easy its crazy
leroy for governor step right up for the mark of the beast for your super fast travel 
tax them make them social security number somehow pass testsomehow somewhereover the rainbowlalala
masterminded individuals lol
the guy in the white shirt is ridiculous 
hes going to be the future governor of new mexico lol yay
i wouldnt have the patience to talk to that last time what an embarrassment
i moved to new mexico from california and let me tell you new mexicos high school graduation rate is 60 lowest in the nation he definitely fits into that population there are plenty of people that are just like him just bad bad bad
crap the last guy is the anti christ
so many dont realize we dont care about legal immigrants the wall is to stop illegal immigration
mexico still not paying for the wall
a country is entitled to its sovereignty but without a border look no further than the immigrant mess in europe and south africa
why throw them out of the country because they broke the goddamn law
built the wall to keep criminals and idiots out of america
i was a fan of crowder but i really dont hope he is a supporter of building this stupid wall i am not for illegal immigrants though
ouch i couldnt keep up with the guy either he is so advanced and i am too stupid or    
im not opposed to the concept of a wall but i dont think it would be effective or feasible
that last guy literally wanted to tax people coming to this country more than americans thats slavery also a xray border what the fuck how would that work a electro magnetic field lmao that whole thing is fucked
holy shit that guy was so thick yet so confident he was leadership material
alot of drugs are just walked over the border so the wall would help with stopping that theyre going to drive poles down deep too so they cant just dig under it too
he wants to run as governor lol he bout dumb as shit
leroy jenkins
governor of new mexico he cant even govern his thoughts and communicate lmfaooo im spanish youre mestizo sheeeeesh find someone smart pls
sure just fucking blame americans because american drug dealers are selling illegals the drugs you fucking idiot every civilized nation on the goddamn planet has drug dealers you stupid fuck
he wants to be the governorthats about rightcrowder this ones a wash
dude needs a few individuals to process his own thoughts hes addicted to scifi movies apparently bwahahaha
you decide to come in illegally youve broken our law so dont you blame anyone but yourself
xray border he has my vote
this guy should work for microsoft or googlealways online
part of the criteria to become a citizen is actually being a legal immigrant open borders do not work it will eat up the country
that guy made me think  but crowder didnt continue asking about how this guy would have an xray without a wallborder
pee is sorted in the balls change my mind
12 billion dollar wall will be stopped from a 12 ladder
if we have to give out free electronic ids and have sensors everywhere for them the materials electricity and services would be so much more expensive than a wall and thats just accounting for the people who would do it legally
the thing with becoming a legal citizen is that the process is not how many citizens think that it is yes there is a process but for many no matter how many times they try they never go through it does not matter if they have no criminal record or anything of the sort they just dont and i mean you might think that they can get a lawyer but the thing is that they are leaving a country full of poverty they themselves are probably in a state of poverty how do you expect them to pay the fines that are asked of for the process to go i understand both sides of the argument but i also believe that the us government can do much more to help them with the process and make sure that everyone has an actual opportunity rather than continuing with the hate and the comments that have been going on
this one was bad no one had a good argument
a thousand million billion trillion is a lot
id be happy to engage you concerning your misguided opinions on this issue fellow
sounds like this dumbass wants to chip people
change the wall build my mind
mexicannot mexicanwho in the 1550s was spanishfrom mexico at the timebut not mexican 
clueless absolutely clueless
an xray borderyeah that will work  is it going to make sure there bones are healthy and let them cross ilegally
taxing illegals means youre the government will only be gaining less than 12 of each individuals income and thats if youre lucky to receive the taxes from undocumented workers this guy with his own show doesnt know shit so how is this kid famous 
you really need someone there to screen out the fruit loops before they just rush in and sit down   lol
look i get that we are all kind of one world but not really but kinda because we are humans etcand i get that borders are essentially arbitrary linesbut if you think we are ready as a species to have a world without any kind of borders or restrictions of movementheres an experimentremove the walls from your house
leeroy for governer
x ray border lmao
lol that look was priceless
why you shouldnt build a wall  too much cost for too little return              there is already a border fence              there are a number of ways to illegally enter the country not just by jumping over the border fence  there are higher priorities such as healthcare infrastructure and education which need more funding  trumps wall is really more of a legacy policy for him rather than something which has been though out  wouldnt conservatives say that if somebody wants to do something illegal theyll do it in any way possible example gun control argument wouldnt this logic point to illegals finding other ways of entering the country
costbenefit analysis is the only question to determine whether whetherhow a wall should be built
honest question where did you get the data about the 37 of violent crimes are illegals im not against you i just want to know where all the info i learn comes from
lol that guy is living in 2048
i would love to speak my thoughts on this topic i really believe on all of the other change my mind but not this one there is already a wall built why waste more taxes payers money
listening to leroy talk makes me picture a group of people hitting the bong hard and coming up with ground breaking and revolutionary ideasconcepts that nobody could possibly ever think of that will absolutely change the world in their minds when in reality not so much they are just super high and cant think straight
yeah its stupid but yall should stop being so meanhe made it clear that it was a free thought so no he didnt think it through its an overthetop idealistic way of thinking and it wouldnt be plausible still no reason to be unnecessarily rude im pretty sure everyone here realizes its stupid without bagging on the guy maybe its just me though
i couldnt take him seriously after he said scientifical hahaha
this is about to be my new favorite video
314 im dying hahahahahah
lol what a jackass
i would love for you to argue with a professor who disagrees and has done extensive research on a topic similarly to how you do all the people you have ever interviewed just get picked on because they are only expressing their feeling but if you talk to someone who can back their opinions up with facts it wont be such a walk in the park
that guy needs to switch to decafffa
beginning to think crowder is just using change my mind to troll the left 
a working adult immigrant can contribute to society immediately but infants tend to take 1620 years before they canwe should ban babies not immigrantsrightor maybe how much people contribute shouldnt be the main deciding factor
this was horrible
a thousand mile long xray machine that makes sense a wall no thanks sounds silly
do a its okay to cage up little mexican kids change my mind video
sources for his statistics about undocumented immigrants make up 37 percent of homicide rate anyone
gonna be the governor of new mexico 
the one dude plays too many damn video games  xray border
scientifical
leroy is a brainless inbred change my mind 
leroy is a typical liberal all talk no  coherence
wow
he really thinks this is fahrenheit 451
that kid is about as sharp as a bag of wet mice
my family has been in mexico since 1550 but im not mexican im spanishlol
that dude did not have the necessary iq
bro wtf did i just watch leroy please do not procreate
the wall is still a fucking ridiculous idea and trump knows it
there is no wage gap change my mind
i feel like most ppl think that if we build a wall that means no more ppl from other countrieseven though thats not the case
omg that spanish dude has me dying
finally more change my minds love learning new things its pretty bad that i have learned more from here than i have in school
i am for immigration reform but im against the wall i think that the wall would be ineffective since people can build tunnels climb over be snuck through checkpoints or simply come over the most common way illegal immigrants already come that is to come on a work visa and then not leave when their visa runs out large empty land masses and desserts can be patrolled by air and giving them more funding for border patrol officers and maybe some walls in particular areas would be more effective and cheaper
is that guy an idiot
how on earth did steven not burst out laughing at the xray border with check points around the country
xray border lmfao
give the guy credit for having the balls to show his face and show what a fucking moron he is
try this somewhere at a sanctuary city like southern california a place dominantly populated by latinos n hispanics id gladly support the event if possible
you sure do have a lot of patience steven lol that 2nd dude was ridiculous
xray machines  are not exactly green nor cost effective this would also have every country chip its citizens  like pets i am not ready  for 1984
why is crowder even having this conversation this guy is the reason we need to deport 
how do i deportreport them that lady gave me the best laugh i had in a long time
people like that guy scare the ever living crap out of me
you know that guy didnt really have that bad of an argument because if we have these ports or stations that tag these tags that these immigrants have when they first enter the country it would keep track of all of them and if one decided to go rogue and not want to pay taxes or whatever anytime they enter any city any store it was being that tag its kind of a good solution but its going to cost a lot but if you really think about it its not that bad of an idea but we should still have our borders but again those tags arent a bad idea
i like your arguments but this one yeah man its a pretty easy one to change your mind on
the whole reason that we want a border is so that our country remains white come on people we know theres a iq gap with these mexicans and the native white populations if these people continue to come in and breed at the rate that they are they will outnumber us and vote for the left destroying our country they will transform the united states into mexico for that is the culture they naturally create we need a place for white americans to survive and prosper we know that the day of the rope is coming for us if we do not secure an existence for our people and a future for white children
xray gates ftw
build that wall fuck these wet backs back to mexico let america worry about americans and let mexico worry about mexicans build that wall 1000 feet tall would be fine with me
i have therory about why steven pretty much always wins the arguments on this showi believe that this show has been produced in such o format where steven has a massive advantage in these arguments one thing you have to relise is that steven must prepare for this show by doing research and by preparing what he has to say but the people who go on the show dont do research because they dont know that it is going to be there
build the xray border painful to watch someone so naive
theres no reason we should deport people who have been here for years working and who havent gotten into any serious trouble them and their families should be given a fast track to citizenship
also an xray gate is fucking stupid you dont need xrays to read ids xrays just give you cancer that shit works on ism frequencies sub 3ghz
steven please redo this one with competent individuals
just tax them holmes
i stupid feel after last persons talk
that ending
i felt my iq dropping with every word
wowjust wow
i got a headache listening to that first dude omg
i think he should have went to a state close to the border lol an get people real opinions
we need xray machines to read the microchips that we tag them with ill be working with scientists and other smart people to make this happen when i become governor of santa fe mom says if im late for dinner again im on my own so i gotta go steven i hope i edumacted you 
build that damn wall change me mind
fake news from crowderhttpcriminologyoxfordrecomview101093acrefore97801902640790010001acrefore9780190264079e93some people are concerned that immigrants are violent and engaged in particular types of violent crime to address this concern martinez lee and nielsen 2004 studied drug and homicide crime in miami florida and san diego california to determine if there is a relationship between violent crime and immigration although both cities have a large hispanic and immigration population martinez et al found that foreignborn persons were not responsible for the communities drug and violent crime the increase in crime was associated with secondgeneration youth who were more likely to be involved in homicides related to drug offending in both communities according to the researchers segmented assimilation among secondgeneration youth can explain criminal patterns since mexican american youth in poor neighborhoods despite cultural assimilation committed violent crimes if however immigrant families had economic stability eg jobs their offspring were not likely to engage in drugrelated homicidesmartinez stowell and lee 2010 analyzed the relationship between homicide and immigration in san diego during periods of major increases in the foreignborn population 19802000 they wanted to test the immigrant paradox the paradox is that despite social disorganization theorys prediction that people living in socially disorganized neighborhoods will have higher crime rates communities with large immigrant populations have lower levels of crime martinez et al posited that immigrants exhibit strong social controls education and mental health attributes and rejuvenate neighborhoods that had been previously considered to be highcrime innercity communities while the researchers found that socially disorganized neighborhoods experienced increases in homicides they also found that when communities had an influx of immigrants there were fewer homicides their findings suggest that while certain neighborhoods foster crime if recent immigrants settle in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods the impact on the violent crime rate can be nullifiedsampson morenoff and raudenbush 2005 analyzed data for chicago between 1995 and 2002 to determine if ethnic and racial differences in neighborhoods account for residents engaging in violence they found that age recent immigration status and ethnicity matters when analyzing crimes of violence youth in all race and ethnic groups are more likely to engage in violence and the level of violence peaks at ages 17 or 18 in addition they found that recent immigrants engaged in less violence than their offspring thirdgeneration immigrants had higher levels of violence than secondgeneration and secondgeneration immigrants had higher levels of violence than firstgeneration immigrants when considering race and ethnicity african americans had higher levels of violence than whites and whites had higher levels of violence than mexican americans even when controlling for neighborhood composition neighborhoods matter if a neighborhood had a higher level of violence prior to changed social demographics changes in the immigrant population then the odds that persons in the neighborhood would engage in violence were significantly higher than in other neighborhoods
yo im spanish and this dude is a straight idiot and does not represent us latinoshispanics lol dudes a dumdass
an xray boardernow why the hell didnt i think of that right along with our government
wtf is this idiot describing an episode of futurama god bless america build the wall 
second guy without knowing it literally is making an argument encouraging people to come here legally and then goes on to recommend that we should use star trek technology to tax illegals  ladies and gentlemen the left
he was proposing a global surveillance system of some sort putting electronic chips in everybodetc666
that guy looks as spanish as my irish grandmother and he has the brain of a potato no a potato is smarter
so if watch some of your clips from time to time im a freeloader and  cheap prick ok then ill stop unsubscribed 
for the love of god deport stupid mexicans like this guy
leroy can pretend all day hes spanish buts that dudes family and roots are a buncha mexicans lol he has just been told by one of his stuck up tias that he has pure spanish blood running through his veins lmfao ya right lol the look on crowders face after listening to this tonto mutt is freakin hilariously priceless haha
not gay jared in the background around 640
those mexicans that claim to be spanish lol
it amazes me how many intellectually vapid people there is out there
even when confronted with statistics this liberal cuck faggot tries to justify it  700 
im from santa fe nm and this guy just made us look so foolish  hes completely clueless
xray border 
maybe people wouldnt try to get into america illegally if it wasnt so hard to become a citizen citizenships and citizenship tests can cost a lot which isnt ideal for a low income mexican family some people just can afford them my dad is canadian and lives here in america hes not a citizen after 15 years of living in the states because he cant afford it not because he cant save up or is responsible enough but because between student loans his inability to get scholar ships in usa from canada and the price of citizenships the odds were stacked against them we dont need a wall we need a gate a gate were we can get well earned citizensships for cheap
oh boy
make one on veganism
building the wall is just a waste of money and pointless
why is so hard for these people  to understand the difference between legal and illegal
build the xray border
i think after that we might need a better part two
crowder always hated the wall and owned by joe rogan shill
illegal aliens mostly do manual labor and are overwhelmingly poor they are going to be consuming a lot more in government spending than they contribute in taxes if you make them legal citizens
wow i think that says it all jesus
omg these people 
god both of them were idiots
new levels of retardation have been exposed crowder is amazing
this guy says make them take a test whatever test they have to take hes not here legally and hes an idiot if they have a job theyre going to get taxed unless they get paid under the table which is another  change my mind episode
here is my problem with a wall its stupid because its super expensive and it doesnt really work its just not worth the money it just costs a lot of money
i laughed so hard when that mexican dude said he was spanish
that mexican is dumb as fuck xcuse my language
guy so there should be some kind of an xray machine or xray gate that reads yoursbody and gives you an idso you dont support a wall but you support a super high tech xray gate that scans your body and gives an id code
this guy just described a dystopian future i dont want to live in  also 5 years till we have an xray border wall thing what ever he said  i honestly dont know
do this again do this again
guy sounds like he hasnt gone to school for shit
steven how do you deal with the ignorance of the kids today kudos sir keep it up
man these people are kinda slow im not for the wall reason being is they will always have ways to bring what they want over or under a wall so it basically does nothing i just give a false sense of safety for most american when in reality it doesnt do shit except waste tax payer money donald trump knew what he was doing with he promised this wall he knew it would reach the masses dumb america and it would help get the vote for him to be in office but i know hes much smarter than you think and im pretty sure even he know that will not stop anything from coming through at the end of the day mexicans or whoever has that wall in front of them will figure a way to get through it
what kind of drugs was that guy on
i wish i could have been there to talk about this i am a mexican i think i could have had a better discussion about it
living in america is not som kind of human right
that white shirt guy is high as fuck
when my grandfather came to this country the officals asked him two hurtful racist questions  aif he had a sponsor already in this country who would support him or b if he had some type of marketable skill since he was able to reply in passable english that he was a trained stonemason they let him in  unfortunately nobody was progressive enough to give him welfare or other freebies so he was only able to be married for sixty years raise three children build his own house work in the coal mines and make extra money by building the town firehall and post office
smart man crowder as always and your next topic should be bringing people in merit base
these are mexican immigrants or mexican americans they dont know anything about mexican politics nor american politics they are uneducated and ignorant real mexicans know better
35 commiting 37 of homicide where did you get that number id like a source
we have a economic problem and have a lot of debt yet a wall is the solution how about we actually focus on paying the debt we as a nation dont have the luxury to build a wall and even with a wall it wouldnt be secure as many think focus on taking down the crime syndicates ill cost less money and solve the problem make a easier way for people to come work legally and with that many problems can be solved securing our borders is kmportant but fixing our country is more important
this man did not say i would have to get a group of select geniuses to figure this out tf hahahhhahahah how does he take himself serious
hmmm digital id still hackable but also can be upgradable it might also use as valid id or use it in grocery store  but it really cost alot iduno mmmm  mark dice looks like dead pool by the way at the last part xd
i think like we just need to have like a supermanlike figure to fly up and down our open border like to stop the illegal immigrants and be like yo gimme those taxes like
so spanish guy whats keeping these new citizens from applying to welfare cant tax someone if theyre not working
leroy has my vote
i hope the hispanic dude you spoke to never runs for office  talk about zero rational logic  of course hes getting an education at your nearest cesspool aka center of higher learning omg  i wrote this before 1140  this numbnut is totally taken with himself  what kind of an insufferable megalomaniac and selfserving tyrant will he be in a few yearssure they commit disproportionate crime but just give them a ss  and make money off of them because we all know theyll stop breaking the law after you give them citizenship and give them a ss  after all since crime does pay why continue engaging in itgeezus  fuckin chicken with its head cut off  these are the fucking morons supporting no borders because of course its working so well in europe right now smh
so no border but the government knows everywhere i go at any given time
holy fuck there are alot of stupid fucking people i dont believe in borders well why dont you fuck the hell off man taxs those people who come in yeah then what they ask for representation and get to vote because you can bet your ass the notaxationwithoutrepresentation thing will come after that soon enough
why have a real wall when you can have a highly radioactive expensive x ray wall
what if they just walk around the x ray machine
this guy is so stupid lol
we arent getting your fucking meme wall if we have a wall they will just use boats to get around it whether they send them to the east cost or west cost it wont do much
we waste millions and trillions of dollars on the drug war bahaha
the issue with the taxing them argument cant work im the end they come here to evade economic oppression why would they come here to be disproportionately taxed in which could very well put them in the same position they left could lead them to the same or more criminal situations such as extortion and selling drugs to make those ends meet in that case they may as well stay back plus it bring up discriminatory issues eventually  one would have to think on that some more
i love how that guy says just give them citizenship as if its that easy and cheap i have friends and family who have spent thousands of dollars and 10 years to gain citizenship while paying thousands of dollars to stay legally in america paying for work visa and applying for citizenship is expensive as hell so i can see why illegal immigrants do it but its not fair for those who do it legally
they act like america is their goody bag its not its not just about taxes you are stealing jobs if i hear hard working one more time i will scream ive lived in other countries i had to come home  people can relocate
this guys preferred idea includes identifying everybody who comes into the country and getting them all to pay taxes not just sales tax  even if you could get the former to happen the latter would not
seems that people who are against building the wall have misinformation about the problem like the two people that were interviewed those who offer a solution pretty much want the static quo an example  open borders and a run round border security  like we had in the last 30 years goes to show some people  do not want change
its drugs thats it not drugseh theres no extra syllable after the s
maximum cringe
two dumb asses in this vid do this in arizona
something tells me that second fella didnt get the best grades in school
room temperature iq
i support deportation but not the wall because the most of illegal immigrants come by plane avtually and the wall would cost so much money and wouldnt be able to fix the costs for a very long time increasing the american debt and it would also need a lot of security that would make it even harder to pay off the debt
the last guy just suggested a digital wall
the guy from new mexico has a really active imagination
rip first lady
these are the two to change your mind steven should set up debates with actual informed people instead of kids and random people who cant even conjure a debatable opposition steven comes prepared and well read the other side should too at this point steven is just having fun with these shallow arguments always fun seeing libturd get wrecked buuuut uptheantesteven
530  yes trump did say that illegal immigrants are bring in a lot of crime and he is completely right  the us sentencing commission looked into the numbers httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvsddkktlcuuq check 150 markthe numbers are staggering and this is a huge case for building the wall besides the other legal cases
that guy wants to party like its 1984
oh steven why do you always talk to poorly informed people i appreciate that the guy is putting thought into the issue but man thats some out there ideas that are highly implausible
the dude who wants to be governor has no clue about anything
what do you get from building a wall  eventually its going to be destroyed thats inevitable its really just a waste of money the usa should focus on bigger problems like gang violence before wasting money on a wall
that guy lives in a different world
we should raise taxes of the middle class and rich to help pay for the wall
that face at the end says it all no need to even explain what you thought about that guy lmao
love your content steven keep it up please lemme kno if you ever come to lubbock texas we have a major collage here for more content and also i would like to have a debate with you
please do capitalism is currently the best economic system available change my mind
they dont send their smartest
dude that spanish dude was obviously tweeking he was jaw jacking like crazy and didnt understand that he was explaining a wall with x ray scanners in it hahaha he had no idea he was agreeing to build a wall
new mexico must have some stupid people
do this in arizona
hahahaha his face at the end
i can kind of see both sides of this immigration issue every country has the right to protect their borders and keep tabs on people coming in and out of their country period but at the same time countries with powerful governments and military like the us went into these countries especially in latin america during the 20th century and did some horrible fucked up things then these countries were stricken by war poverty drugs no stable economygovernment then the citizens flee to places like the us its kind of like karma i read an article with sources where theyve listed like 20 horrible corrupt things the us has done in latin america in the past 100 years or so and thats of what we know it makes you think
that first lady breaks my heart she wants to do the right thing but doesnt know how to do it 
this guy is annoying and foolish
finally a more interesting change my mind topic
well  there ya have it
just felt embarrassed for that new mexico guy
it is so easy to change stevens mind just tell him a wall is useless put small outposts along the border and fill them with veterans thats the solutionbut that people is so stupid to come up with something good
nobody wants to sit down and talk because even though they disagree and have limited opinions on the wall they think that their stances are so obvious and righteous that all they have to do is yell rather than provide a real argument
why did you waste your time with that retard he couldnt even give you a straight answer it was like talking to someone who has done at least 2 lines
an xray wall is this total recall lol
hooey if all of the illegals are as bright as the guy from new mexico then i can easily see why the liberals want them to be voting citizens bunch of sheep
the second guy was stupid and had no valid arguments hes just saying his opinion on what the government should do go back to college campuses please
good heavens were on earth those people lives not in this world1 guy says in future we can go anywhere without wallhe should get more informed that was the dream of the left europeits not working europeans countries are building protections wallsaround their monuments publics space inside their own citys ludicrous its not even funny
the law is the law is the law millions more could lawfully immigrate but illegals are hurting them more and more
see kids  this egg is your brain this hot frying pan is drugs  when you put the egg on the hot frying pan youre logic will be like this spanish dude  yup an xray wall of some sort to keep track of illegals ok wait what  lol
tons of conservatives and libertarian are against building the wall for financial reasons but still believes in immigration policy that can be enforced im surprised you didnt get any of those types to discuss with you
first one sounds like an idiot at work that said trump is racist cause he wants to deport all mexicans per her listing to the fake news she sounds like the same this started cause i was looking at a fox news article on president trump and she called him racist i asked why she said he wants to deport mexicans i said nope he wants to deport those that are here illegally then said prove where he said anything else she basically ran away second dude that said his family is spanish guess he doesnt know how the spaniards killed the tribes in mexico just like the english killed the american indians yet not to the same point the spaniards dideta where is the video of the dude that kept contradicting himself
that man was on drugs but i thought caucasians had the highest rate of overall crime
end the drug wall and so many of these problems would be eased
the spanish guy watches too many movies electronic xray wall
why even give this clueless spaniard any airtime at all  he is completely incoherent
1316  1317 crowder decides to audition for the office
he will become the governor of new mexico his mouth writes checks that his ss cant cash in that aspect hes already a great politicianalsomarkofthebeastmakeitrealgiantfreeflowingxraywallxraywallthatcannotfall
i think immigrants should be able to come and work but we need to know who is entering the country enforce the border take down welfare or reinforce who receives it so we dont have people coming in and not doing anything positive and living off of citizens taxes i dont know if its clear what im saying  any comments
the face steven made at the end was fucking priceless
his family came over from spain to north american in 1515  mexican but i cant wait for the technology that scans people and tags them so they can be taxed he is a free thinker free from reality
he bout to get her killed
i bet i could totally change stevens mind on the wall
the wall cost so much money it is just retarded to actually spend any money on it especially sense its a wall you can get over a wall
the xray thing kind of makes sense
it the last guy half mexican half korean
you are a complete retard change my mind  yeah punish the illegals make them citizens and give them ss s tax them to the hilt and waste that money and give it to idiots and criminals
but if we did the tagging system people would argue saying but we are more than numbers lloledit 1104
some kind of xray scannerthats what i want every time i leave the country someone gets a picture of my dong
border should be strictly enforced on all sides not just mexican border those muslims responsible for 9 11 came from canada huge crime lords operate in and out of florida new york and california
fuck that spanish but not really guy was painfully annoying to listen to
this video is an iq vacuum
dude this actually gave me a headache the guy he interviewed has absolutely no fucking clue what hes talking about and couldnt keep his train of thought going in the same direction for longer than 30 seconds smaller attention span than a damn goldfish
my intelligence was just disturbed
hahahahhahahahaha an xray machine that guy is amazing
what can you possibly say to these peoplethey will only understand when they lose a jobor loose a loved one
jesus these people are ignorant as fuck
jesus what is this hellhole i feel sorry for you 56ers
i want to see you do something like this in san antonio
i am not for building the wall because i think it would be a waste of resources i also think that we need to actually enforce the laws we have and then maybe reform the laws to be more effective the only way to stop illegal immigration is that eliminate the incentives for breaking the rules
x r a y b o r d e r
this guy is a fucking idiot interview someone who has an iq of over 70 at least jesus christ
wow so that guy leroy is either mentally handicapped or has never thought about any of this for a single second before he sat down to argue it i dont know know if ive ever seen a more uninformed fantastical absurd argument even on the internet i mean come on magical impossible and eyewateringly expensive xray spy tech is cool for the border but a wall is going too far leroy is special for real and one day he plans on being the governor of new mexico a state that actually elected a libertarian governor watch this space yall this kid is tooootally going places
i think that the wall is just a waist of money but i do agree with the fact that we need to crack down on people illegally entering the country the wall will cost like 14 billion from what i remember and there are still other ways that people can get into the country like plane tunnels secret compartments in vehiclesps i am writing this off of memory from a debate i did in school so dont roast me
i can only say lol this shit was hilarious how do people get so stupid keep up the good work though steven
please redo this at a school pleaseeeeee these arguments were horrible
its 2018 walls dont mean shit go back in time and they didnt mean anything just a symbol nothing more 
i think its stupid how most people cant make a remotely sound argument against the wall because they are so worked up about trump
why build a wall i wanna know
build the wall keep the fuckers out i think it ought to be open season man woman child he is seeing a legal you shoot them on site and all you people that hire him you are to be shot too cuz your criminals so build the wall cuz its not right the ones that do things right there come over here pay their taxes work their ass off and get their citizenship keep them fuck the rest of them man woman child dont matter kill them sorry ass pics wetbacks
supporting building a wall via socialism actually destroys crowders change my mind segment for socialism is evil
i dont like how you kept the audio in that she obviously didnt want the mic to pick up
can we just get this wall built already
second guy makes no since lmao 
i feel like the only thing i took away from this is that the girl in the background has a cute butt
please never let the second guy be our governor
an x ray border that links everyone who comes through into a database sounds super expensive how about we save more money and build a wall
1314 that face when you lost some brain cells
wait a minuteblack dudes are responsible for 50 of homicides and you are saying illegal immigrants are responsible for 30 plus percent of homicideswhat percentage of the black male murderers are also illegal immigrantswhen i read these stats i always assume they were black african americans and not illegal immigrantson the face of it you appear to be saying that between them they are responsible 80  of all murders
anyone else get a 25 minute ad from tai lopez 
blur the womans badge
i dont see how the new mexican spaniard didnt see that his plan doesnt work if people dont want to have a border id tag because they dont want their illegal conduct being tracked  therefore a border barrier is required logistically to funnel people tothru a checkpoint
taxing illegals good luck doing that the government dont know anything about them
hahah legalizing and taxing them wont happen  all the parties involved are already refusing due process for their own gain  if you allow de facto slavery you cant make your slaves into citizens or else you have to pay them a legal minimum wage and be registered and monitored by the government in all your business practices and that hurts your business  you wouldnt just be able to pay them cash off the books in exchange for not ratting them out anymore  they dont want to pay taxes and aside from expensive and highly invasive crackdowns on every small local business nothing is going to stop them from illicitly inviting and harboring cheapass labor off the books  its like slavery too many people see it as an economic necessity  if you cant convince state government to cooperate with the feds as it is how are you going to convince the slavemasters themselvesnow they cant do the invasive crackdown without total hardline support from all agencies involved and the months or years of downtime alone in all the agricultural operations during this illegal labor crackdown would create food shortages or at the very least an economic panic for a very long time  the wall is the only answer  itll allow us to slowly drain ourselves of immigrants and replace the work force from our own willing population  we cant have another civil war over this  build the wall
these same people who dont want a wall lock their doors have a fence and wouldnt let these people just move into their house hypocrites
go green global lmao
i find these people that dont want the wall in the video is becouse trump simply suggested it the people all agree about knowing who comes in through the border but how can you do that with out the securing our border an xray wall wtf is that all these peoples suggestions different ideas but none of then can be done if we cant secure our border a wall really helps
even you build a wall they can go through you beaches just like in europe
we owe it to our citizens and legal immigrants to stop illegal immigrants from gaining access to this country i really dont understand how thats arguable
you guys dont know yet trump is bringing the great wall of china to america
most of the illegal immigrants are going to the usa  because they want a better future for their families and because the life in their countries is really hard and finding a job with a good income is easier in usa than in their country unfortunately the immigrants dont have the privilege of a easy life like americans and sometimes they made crimes with the purpose of surviving im sure that if the government give a opportunity to the immigrants to have a formal job the rate of  crimes would be lower  because a 99 of immigrants go to usa to work hard but most of the time they dont have the opportunity of getting a job and they need to do crimes to be able of survive life is really hard for them and building the wall is not the beat thing to do in my opinion
845 wow this guy literally says in the next 510 years country borders will not be a thing
that guy wants open open borders and a digital code that tracks usyikes its weird that todays resistance is for more government control hahah  hes a  poster boy for the nwo
forgot to blur first womans badge
find a smart one steven dang
well this was a cluster fuck
the second guy is absolutely confused
my head hurts
i love the look on jareds face as he is listening to that guys bs i dont know how steven didnt burst out laughing
family has been in new mexico since 1550 county was founded in 1776
where is steven getting the statistic that illegal immigrants are committing 37 of the murders in the us we always hear the stat that black people are commiting 50 of the murders so between black people and illegal immigrants were talking over 80 of the murders that seems inaccurate
seems 1 they kind of want some better border protection or 1 to scared to outwarding agree 2 dont know what the wall actually is better border protection 3 confused regardless thanks to the msm misinformation and fear mongering 4 have delusional support from white liberals who just yell out abuse so never really had any constructive and rational debate with anyone else
this was sad go to another more populated place
it is a shame that there wasnt any real discussion i would have liked to see someone bring up the potential effectiveness of a wall in regards to the high percent of illegal immigrants that arrive by plane and the significant impact a wall would have ecologically speaking also the financial cost of building and maintaining it assuming it was given automated systems to not need to be fully manned surveillance equipmentinstead we got xray borders facepalmi am  against the wall but i am not pro illegal immigration
a lot of hispanics i know legal really hate illegals they worked their ass to get here legally while illegals exploit the libtard hearts
i support protection along the border however i think that building a wall is pretty short sighted im not saying i have a magic solution i just suggest that we look into further advancing technology lets say drones for shits longer battery easier to manipulate in weather and just basics etc instead of basically throwing away money people could probably just hop the fence would effectively need more border patrol for a slow and boring job spend a ton of money not only on the wall itself but also its going to have upkeep and that going to cost even more find a way for technology to watch the border i guess is what i am getting at sending a group of specialized group of officers to a specific place just makes more sense than just mass number sitting and waiting
im actually getting bored of these simply because noone makes even a close to valid argument against steven d
dude im for the wall but i could make a better argument against it than these people
it would be nice to see steve sit down and talk with an actually smart liberal  not to see them destroy each other i just think it would be entertaining to see two intellectuals with opposing views arguing about society
i cant watch the change my mind episodes because i get too frustrated with these idiots
x ray  scanner  but no wall  ok lol
imoprtant with the new regulations in california i know need to submit to the california dmv 3 forms of real id to continue my 2nd amendment right since we now issue ids to anyone i now need to prove after 51 years that i am actually who i say i am to buy a gun or fly on a plane my current id is no longer valid for anything federal explain to me how it has cone to pass that the constant is now the one proving residence
hahaha im gonna have to sit down with some masterminds ill get back to you
man that guy is sooooo fucking stupid it literally hurts my fucking head
that face at the end xd you were probably thinking wtf did i just listen too
seriously whats the problem i am honestly confused on what is so confusing about the simple concept known as illegalz what do these people not understand about illegal we cant just go flaunting into their country or any other country and hide in a sanctuary city we have to do it legally with a passport or by being a legal citizen and thats the problem they do not understand that so they think they could just come over here there for the wall would be necessary its called security people its a very simple concept
more intelligent conversations needed
why so short
an xray border sounds really efficient and effective lol i wont say the rest of what im thinking haha
i got a trump ad 
these videos are so hard to watch because the average american off the street doesnt know enough to have a real conversation about anything political its so cringe
the first lady truly made it a real thing most of these idiots have know idea there are criminals coming in and out of the us from mexico illegally her statements really put this shit into perspective there are soooo many criminals coming in and out of the us its unacceptable
that guy sounds like he approves of the new world order lol bar codes scanners no borders  separating countries 
lmao
stop watching the video once you get to 410  the person who sat down at that point has no clue what hes saying and is saying it very loudly
hahaha a xray boarder with a written statement on why your going lol im going for governor
i just think its immoral
nice jim stare at the end
the meme i would post about the second guy is  oh no its retarded
this guys intellect is unmatched
i wish i can change ur mind about this which i know i can without saying all this nonsense and give u actual reasoning instead of what the majority of this uneducated specimens are telling you
he dumb in got his on show
i have to say i agree with some of the things you bring up in these segments but i dissagree with this one my problem with the wall is its just a political grandstanding move that would cost us taxpayers if it were donation based funded im fine with that although i really dont understand the use historically walls dont work so in a time when we have helicopters planes boats submarines and machines that can dig through our earth underground im less than convinced your going to stop much drug trafficking the cartels have fuck you money and they will find a way to get the product to the streets so the only people you would be stopping with a wall are the people in desperation the ones who try and trek across the dessert with their kids to give em better lives and honestly imo if they make it to the us and they are non violent they should definitely get a path to citizenship
if theres not going to be a border just annex mexico
press f for respect poor woman is gonna get killed by the illegals that are loan sharks in her building for outing them to millions of people on the web she probably owes them money and is trying to get them deported so she doesnt have to pay them back pretty fucking smart actually
you blur her face but no the id lol fail
tax illegal immigrantswhat in the fuck kind of idea is that
the problem is not going to fix itself and its never going to go away so lets just make it worsethat guy is unto something here
i see im not the only one that feels less intelligent after watching that the leroy part at least
im not mexican im spanish my family has been in new mexico since the 1500sif your family was in new mexico since the 1500s your ass is native mexican mexican are part spanish he does not look 100 spanish excuse me 
build the wall 
isnt an xray border still a controlled border though
they just come in with a visa and continue to stay once it has expired
anti brick wall pro xray wall oh umm okay
electronically tagging people as if that wont be considered a human rights violation
that second guy is def on something
i bet that guy would also defend pedophilia and incest if the discussion was about islam
america please build that wall i wish we had one in the uk
wow maybe not only a wall for old mexico might need one for new mexico too if that guy ever becomes govenor lord help them all but they did have gary johnson
this shouldve been longer and if drugs were legal and regulated the cartels would lose a lot of momentum
his fucking face at the end lolol
bless his heart
633 you said that illegal immigrants commit 37 of murdershomicides but that isnt true ive found on article that states this but it was wrong for example federal data shows that in 2015 illegals did 55 of murders  which ill admit is still too much being only 35 of the population  all other crimes they do commit a way larger disproportional rate though as wellrobbery kidnapping drugs possessiontrafficking ect
how disconnected from reality was the last guy an xray border because that wouldnt cost a fortune amirite
you should do this question again at a college like im against the wall and all but these were horrible debates he used the word scientifical
as an unfortunate resident of california the reality of illegal immigration is part of the culture here the reality is that our construct is is that illegal immigration is integral to the economic health of the state as a hole as a bug club subscriber i can say that in an unbiased option have found the illegals are just looking for a better life i still feel border security id important but there is no doubt that the democratic party is solely concerned about the vote
im glad homeboy recorded it alsoso he watch it over and over to see how stupid he sounds
the wall is pointless imo arguably even detrimental consider that most illegals in the country these days didnt actually run across a border many came on boat a plane etc and another large chunk are overstaying visas thats not to say a wall wouldnt deter illegal influx but it certainly isnt the primary component and its arguably not as useful anywayi claim the wall would be ineffective because walls already exist mexico has one along its southern end this hasnt stopped guatemalan honduran salvadoran colombian and venezuelan influx at all drugs illegal firearms and illegal immigrants still flood past those walls into mexico and then the us and canada adding one more wall isnt much of an obstacle when there are many up already in modern day the only effective border wall is the one along north korea its an extremely militarized zone that shoots anything that moves and has robots and minefields everywhere designed to automatically kill anything that comes near the us could never set up such a border wed be considered inhumane by the rest of the developed world and have the opportunistic chinese and russians and eu ready to spread democracy onto us for once then lets consider the cost mexico will pay for the wall has always been a meme we all know this this wall is coming out of our pocket and contributing to the disastrous mess the national budget has become it might not even provide the benefit people expect in other words were paying for a product that already exists in other countries and has not done muchfinally lets consider the implications behind it the immigrant communities seem to consider the wall to be a symbol of hostility racism xenophobia whatever whether theyre correct to harbor such sentiment is irrelevant the fact is that they do and because they do the wall would serve to create a further divide internally republican support from minority communities saw an increase leading up to trumps election can we afford to divide and alienate these same groups im not sure its not of debate that illegal immigration is harmful to the country it absolutely needs to be remedied but a wall imo does very little to target the actual problem
how does that second guy verbalize words without closing his mouth
ive been planning on being the governor of new mexico
so we shouldnt intrude upon illegal immigrants with a border wallbut requiring people to be chipped and tracked by the government at invisible checkpoints is totally kosher did i get that right
can you come to los angeles
i just dont think its worth the cost walls havent stopped people since they invented the ramp ladder and rope this is a waste of money
funny because illegals cost 135 billion tax dollars and only pay 19 billion in tax
fastuh drugsuh  scientifical dudes funny
protect our culture deport all illegals protect your community and family to report illegal aliens call 1866dhs2ice 18663472423
lol got a crowder ad
build the wall deport these parasitesthats what my mom saidps she is from mexico
looks like the mexican in the white shirt forgot to turn on his camera
that second guy was on meth
iq intelligence quotient it is something destined in your dna just like your hair colour and height  not everyone can be smart you cant make someone more intelligent just like you cant make a white swedish man into a black jamaican one  this false idea that somehow if we just give enough education and opportunity that low iq people will suddenly become high iq is well false  no science to prove it lots to prove otherwise   that being said this last guest was dumb af
illegal immigrants commit crimes at a disproportionate level yeah 100 there illegal immigrants
how do you tax illegal people probably not known to exist
wtf i just got a change your mind ad
the title alone had me laughing before i even decided to watch this
1306  so much cringe
that spanish guy was fucking delusional lol wtf this is why this country is fucked wow
this was very disappointing
oh hells naw get some real debaters here these mexicans were embarrassing and im one
wow an xray border why didnt trump think of that
you are shafting that  lady that came onif she was my neighbour or a work colleague i would recognise heryou either need to block her image out completely or remove the clipplease dont leave it like this i think you are going to be responsible for her being attacked
try a part 2 for this topic too short but yeah must be hard trying to find people who will talk and not just scream
i feel bad for the first ladie and i really want to rip the 2nd guy but he did say he hasnt thought it through so i want to give him the benefit of the doubt oh yeah build the wall
crowder is such a beta and im not even a liberal the dudes a pussy
this guy lol whats with his strange uhs that he throws in opiatesah ummm no it pronounced opiates
i disagree with the wall primarily because i dont think it is a cost effective intervention  the biggest problems involve tunnels and other underhanded methods
this was so cringe 
that intro tho lmao
im as conservative as they come and disagree with you steven we shouldnt build a wall we should setup military outposts along the border move bases near the outposts move 10s of thousands of troops to the area to patrol the border by land by air by satellite use drone surveillance laser fencing physical patrols and practice military exercises in conjunction with border patrol just my 02
break down the fence dont build the wall build towers draw a gun line wait for them to cross and ya know
did the pro illegal immigration guy just say tag em like having the border patrol agents tackling people and electronically tagging them on the ear like wild game  wow
keep up good work steven  company 
illegal immigrants caught by ice should be put to death change my mind
wowthe king of the morons has been identified
did anyone change his mind
the second person was an absolute and total dip shit oh man
fucking interviews the 2 un educated dumb as f legal mexicans that cant put 5 words together without stuttering please interview someone smarter stop showing these trash people and call this bull shit an interview
ummmmm what
leroy is retarded
you wouldnt believe the add that came with this video there were mexicans and americans who came together at a gap in a border fence so they could play soccer accross the border wow youtube really nailing it on relevance
bro youre mexican your ancestors adopted the spanish language because they were conquered by spain
only 13 minutesnopeyou did  not get the permits to set all this shit up only to make a 13 minute video
so what makes an xray border different than a wall
when they walk through the gate gates are on fences fences are walls
jaredpull your shoulders back and flex that piece on your hip
i bet the guy show if full of trollers lmao if not they are very slow
can you do another episode becausei dont think i need to explain myself maybe do it in a different setting as well
wait the guy said he is spanish but says he is from new mexico
i dont understand anything that came out of his mouth is he a student please tell me someone isnt paying for his schooling this sounds like a very poorly thought out dystopian storyline
drugsa a thing of the pasta databasea this guy is talking like a southern preacher
that the office moment 
did that last guy really call pharmaceutical drug companies drug dealers selling their drugs illegally who needs the fda or pharmacies 
love how the guy at 1030 was advocating for microchipping people and setting up a total surveillance state the liberal lefts wet dream apparently
the only reason to not build a wall is due to a desire for illegal activity on the border in my opinion
i really think you should have done more to hide that womans identity  she made you aware that the info she gave you was a danger to her  why leave the id card voice and unique purse
honestly this guy is on something this is insane wtf honestly
the second guy understand that not every one will obey the rules then why putting an xray gate would make them line up to be processed the logic there hurts my brain
i like it when people make the effort to try and articulate their thoughts i think i get what they guy was getting at like checkpoints with airplane scanners obviously he has to chuck the no borders in for his buddies it was obvious he didnt really want free flowing borders lol
the spanish guy was pissing me off idiot that think his thoughts are revolutionary
this comment section is as cancer as that 16th century mexican that sounds like he just crossed the border
watch machete 2  theyll dig while we build  mexicans might as well be mole people  look into the tunnels already found in the last like 20 years
this was the least eloquent change my mind ever
haha how his face changed when leeroy said xray scanner 1031
everyone on this video and in the comments  are in 2018 but leroy leroy is living in 3018 xray tag borders make that 4018
can somebody please give me a brief description of steven crowders facial expression at the end of the video it was kind of offputting
i think he was suggesting we microchip put trackers on people entering the country they would also have to go through xray this would all happen at different gates but how the hell are you going to get them to go through a gate that isnt part of a wall or barrier at the very least a wall will make it damn near impossible for human trafficking into the country
leroy is on some other shit lol
borders arent goin to disappear they are just gonna become stricter because humans and becoming more tribalistic
should you guys have blurred the badge  i dont know if someone could dox her from that
woow crowder help legal immigrant to face illegal aliens gangs and libtard who acuse crowder being racist hide in their mansion
did anyone find an ounce of logic in a single thing the second guy said
this guy is so cringey to listen to i cant handle that he cant understand that the reason they came here illegally was to avoid being documented and have to pay taxes
lol im not mexican im spanishlmfao no youre southcentral american my family has spanish ancestry theyre white no such thing as nonwhite ethnic spanish the spanish are europeans
was the last guy on c r a c k
yeah tax people that arent in the system ones that arent in the system are trafficking drugs humans and money in and out of this country illegal immigrants come from honduras mexico russia and many other places laws need to be changed to make the process faster more in depth backgrounds and follow ups with people in this temporary citizenship status the us agricultural department hire many undocumented workers that truly came here to help their family and be a us citizen and to those people thank you the biggest and best argument for a wall is the great wall of china it worked boom end of story sanctuary cities need to be demolished undocumented citizens that are caught need to quickly and efficiently be processed and if they commit a crime they should be handled even more severely it will slow down if the us enforces and makes better laws regarding illegals
that dude was talking faster than ben shapiroholy shit dude its okay to take a breath every once in a while
senor trump can you toss our football back over por favor  gracias
leroy actually said we can tax people coming into the country that are poor and have no money rofl
until now i have always been in support of stevens positions but i believe the wall would only provide the illusion of security at a high costa show i watched in the past hired 6 illegal immigrants to build a segment of wall to the proposed specifications perhaps the specs have been revised as this show was many years ago  it took a lot of time and money to accomplish this on a very small scale  then they split the illegals into 3 teams of two men  they instructed one group to go over it one group to go through it and one group to go under it  they provided the men simple tools  each team accomplished their tasking in under two minutesthe proposed wall will need to be more intelligently designed and implemented than simply a physical barrier   it will need sophisticated drone monitoring from above rapid response teams of security stationed across its vast expanse underground detection systems to sense tunneling engineering and maintenance teams to repair and constantly adapt it to the efforts of our undesirable etc etcwithout these controls and no doubt many more i havent  considered this wall is just a waste of money which provides only the illusion of security  with the additional controls i mentioned this wall may work but will likely cost many billions of dollars in materials and human resources to build operate and maintain  it would also require new laws in place to treat those thwarted in their attempts to bypass it as terrorists or violators wont fear the wallthis wall would also require making many small groups of special police with the full backing of the us and mexican governments who are authorized to treat the dangerous illegals as terrorists and prosecute them very harshly  these special police would also feed information gathered through criminal arrest and interrogation which will allow special forces groups to target  sources for this activity and eliminate them by any means necessary  hopefully with the collaborative efforts of the central and south american countriesthis wall will require all of this and more to truly stop this problem of these criminals thumbing their noses at our border and legal systembut the cost is high and will likely if successful only bring rise to a new breed of domestic criminal to supply the drugs and fill the power vacuum left by the former regime
this turned into a vid about our failing education system
stop using the drugs and mexicans will stop bringing the drugs stop the demand and the supply will die
because illegal immagrants who are already criminals are going to pay taxes
my mother illegally crossed the usmexican border before i was born and i am 100 for building the wall illegal immigration is disgusting behavior seeing unintelligent people like this try to prove their points is utterly painful since they lack the knowledge and vocabulary to put up a good argument and the statistics of undocumented immigration speak for themselves when are we going to wake up and start enforcing better border control
citations in the description please
second dude is the hood guy who started getting into politics last week and is now trying to preach shit with his crazy ideas haha
where do i find this tweakers youtube channel that would be amazingi cant tell if that is adderal or meth
i have to say the first lady that was talking was incredibly brave to bring forward information about illegals regardless of her initial stance
that new mexico hombre is on drugs he is a clear example of stefan molyneuxs theories on iq and society wellness  
so what that dude was saying was that there should be like an entrance of some sort where people can check in before coming into the country yeah that already exists its called a port of entry and what hes describing is basically legal immigration whos going to break it to him that thats what it is and that it already exists
scientifical
then end where he stared right into the camera reminded me of jim from the office
go green global lmaohe better stop smoking the green or its gonna get worse
how you didnt crack up when he said  idk one day i plan on being the governor of new mexico  but yet used words such as scientifical 
one day i want to sit down at one of these to pretend to disagree with you and at the very last minute yell syyyyke no brakes
go through scanners  fuck that guy lol  what an idiot  with no borders why would they go threw your scanners you asshat   holy fuck this dude is dumb
first of all anyone in the us illegally is a criminal because you broke the law fence jumping now steven id like to see a video asking why people cant stand up to their government and demand better conditions for them to stay in their own country are they too scared to fight for their right  why do liberals feel they have to put the burden of sorrow on us citizen taxpayers but then not protesting these illegal aliens own government i believe the majority of us americans really want to help but they have been taken advantage of for so long it causes hard feelingwe have plenty of  us citizens that are down on their luck homeless and disabled vets that our own government kick to the side in order to accommodate the illegal alien us citizens come first what i say
that spanish guy seems to think we were living in the year 2300 lol
xray gates lets ignore the obvious problem with that and tackle the other problem that poses gates are attached to walls
lmao this second nigga made me hurt my brain on a spiritual level poor crowder just has to sit there as that guy talks about futurama
more of these
lmfaooo xray barcode boarders    this guys lit up on something for sire
that last guy anti border nut job scary to see people like that roaming our streets sad
i am against the wall walls historically dont work the great wall of china caused the invasion of china  the maginot line was turned against the defendersfrench the berlin wall cause the smuggling of people to be a thing  to increase and they shot people at the berlin wall and people still tried to cross and got around it 21 billion dollars could be spent to stop illegal immigration in other way more useful ways such as better training better wages more personal court procedures  public education and better tech all much more important to illegal immigration then a wall a wall is only good as a symbol and barley for anything more
he was awful to listen to he cant talk or understand what is going on i lost it when he said about building some sort of xray on the boarder 
if the border wall is too expensive then why is leroy advocating for a way more expensive solution haha
why dont i get a notifications for your videos malarky i say
can you debate an intelligent person
that guy wants to live in total recall
brah was quoting the movie coco  if you ever saw the movie youd know what im talking about
243 i dont watch vox i watch real news like stevecrowder
please go to my school colorado state university and do one of thesei would love to see them try to reason through their points
that dude is not spanish bullshit
ladies and gentlemen the future governor of new mexico
take a breath dude your spewing vomit
im not for spending a bunch of money on some bullshit wall that wont work we might as well build me a mansion why because fuck you thats why
dudes familys been here since the 1500s he cant even speak proper english
lets put microchips in our bodies so that the government can track us 247 yay
a xray scanner border that can read their digital id code or have them write down why theyre coming into the country ok first off where would they receive these id codes or present these excuse notes without a border or check point technology isnt magic if such tech existed it wouldnt be able to magically tag a person when they just happen step into america if anything it would cost way more in maintenance and installation along with 247 cyber security than a actual wall
time to vent this series of change my mind is one of the best ways to expose the lack of common sense that exists in america today it shocks me how many people are genuinely delusional and cant seem to see the simple solution being proposed perhaps its the media outlets today polluting and infecting the minds of the masses resulting in a lack of intellect theres no point in inviting him back to share his grand idea of x ray scanning borders with digital pass codes some people are not capable of seeing the bigger picture or adjusting their stance on a topic like this people who think like this are operating off of someone elses logic and opinions and are simply following the leftie trend of antitrump everything rather than actually piecing a puzzle together which is to build the wall and finding common ground they resist logic to save their ego and poisonous mindset  this guy thinks he can solve it with his own creativity theres a concerning number of people just like this guy whos mission is to argue that you are wrong you allow these people to  make fools of themselves and it is necessary for the survival of the smartest very sad indeed
honestly being an immigrant i cant say i hate anyone who likes trump or wants the wall true i did commit a crime at a young age by coming here illegally but i wasnt even aware of it i have lived a normal life like any other kid until i was asked for my social security  i do see things both ways and i agree that some of the people that come here from other countries dont  help the usa but honestly the majority and i would say 95 of them are honest and hard working people that contribute to the us aside from that the law is the law and weather we like it or not we have to follow it and we cant change it if anything we are here at mercy im not making excuses for breaking the law but if only americans and other people saw us as human beings first other then just an iligal alien from another country things would be different and america can benefit from it so build your wall protect your people if thats what you bealive
his xray wall still requires voluntary taking an id with you  if you want to sneak in without such  just go trough the non existant wall  the wall is the an idea to prevent illegal sneaking in and out  not legal traveling 
do it build the fucking wall
when these idiots dont want to secure the border with the wall are asked what they do to protect the security of the country it always ends up being way more invasive than the wall freaking xray borders and id tags was this guy crazy
xray border democrats should run in november on that genius idea
the guy from new mexico is completely clueless
build it twice as tall as planned and throw every illegal over it and every liberal with them
im not mexican my family moved there in the 1550sguy that makes u like a 12th generation  mexican
funny how the guy still sees himself as spanish is against a wall when spain has a big ass wall to stop africans from entering search spain wall in africa for more info
150 she is very stupid beach
blurring her face wasnt enough this could get that lady into trouble from those illegals
an electronic id taghhhhwwwhhhattt  sounds like cattle marking to me
this guy from new mex is a moron
this guys living in 3018
that guy is stupid as fuck and is exactly why we need a 28th amendment to strip us citizenship for x y and z reasons
inarticulate ignorant unbelievable loonno real solutions just some video game inspired ideas from a person who has yet to grow upgovernor   i dont think sohow do you work with people like thischuck schumer has stated the democrats will not work with the trump administration and the republicans on any immigration legislation whatsoeverthat says how urgent they really think this problem isthe want to keep this problem going to use in the midterm electionsnow who is  despicableya
that guy seems to be addicted to doing too much drugs and then watch scifi movies where everything is detected and seen and caught through some electronic stuff and thangs lol
1 how do illegals pay tax they get a fake social and a fake green card employers dont check on the e vertify system why because they need the cheap labor 2 building the wall wont help because most border patrol agents let criminals in because all this drug money is most likely a war that wont end if people dont stop using drugs its a supply and demand
the us shouldnt build a wall on our southern border because it is simply a misappropriation of federal dollars the vast majority of illegal immigrants get into the country legally but overstay their welcome not leaving when there visa is up or having a vacation of an indefinite time a wall would not stop limit or otherwise reduce such forms of illegal immigration since those forms of immigration make up the majority of illegal immigration cases and being that the goal is to greatly reduce illegal immigration time and federal dollars would be better spent looking for a different solution to illegal immigration
build the wall
build that wall
2 million subs nice
they werent really arguements tho lol was that it only 2 people
tax them is this how stupid this guy is so cross the border illegally and if you dont get caught all is well and good life on the other hand cross the border illegally and if you did get caught granted them citizenship and tax them so forget the law and keep crossing the border illegally because the penalty for breaking the law is granted citizenship and tax wow hes not very bright hahaha
congrats on 2 million man wow how far youve come much love
the second interview sounds like so many leftists in the uk with the immigrants get them in they can get jobs  pay tax great idea what about the people born here who have paid taxes but are currently out of work maybe even homeless  want to get there lives in ordershame those virtue signallers are happy to help everyone from outside there own country but forget theres over 1 million already unemployed
people are against the wall because trump wants it if trump was against the wall there would be far more support for it
i rebuilt the name tag using multiple points of focus and was able to get her name
it is painful to watch this guy talk the lady exposed some truth though
these people are dumb as shit
when he talks it sounds like a child describing his lego city
a digital border isnt exactly the worst idea problem would be verifying the people crossing but also freeing up taxes on americans and instead start adding a temp foreign worker tax and also a extra tax on wiring money overseas too with the idea of citizens paying less taxes overall
jess christ hispanic people arent to greatest at debating im not sure if its just a lack of understanding or language barrier 
this woman at the beginning was about to tackle a very strong point on not to build a wall you see she comes from mexico that is to known for bloody ruthless cartels easily killing all the police and controlling a lot of area they also have extreme wealth and intuitive ways of using smuggling trafficking tactics that building a wall would be futile the fact is that they do have underground tunnels that nobody knows about a secret underground infrastructure that holds many passages into our country she spoke briefly about a war she was obviously extremely scared she was worried about increased conflict in mexico these cartels do not play games they have a serious monster grip on the throat of mexico and the us is a massive customer building at wall wouldnt work they will go under it around it through it and it really doesnt matter they just need to massacre enough people on their side to control vantage points so they can implement there devious plans
moronic leroy in the white tshirt communicates at a 3rd gradelevel  what a complete idiot i one day plan on being the governor of new mexico  i weep for the future
a wall or bullets there arent too many options here making tax profiles by status seems more unfair maybe there wont be a wall forever but until lives are fully monitored we have limited options
god bless that first lady i hope everything works out for her and she stays safe
i want what the last guy was onomg i almost died xd this is how a lot of people think these days and its so sad
leeroy has a killer valley girl accent drugsa
this was a let down for sure 
build the wall is dumb because you save more money just enforcingthe law change my mind
reasons why the wall would be a bad idea 1 it would cost billions to make america is already in debt2 its biased why isnt there a border wall at the canada border3 el chapo escaped prison through tunnels people are resourceful will find other ways to cross the borderreal answer to end illegal immigration make meth and cocaine legal then let natural selection do whats its suppose to do
that was a trainwreck
i think that man was on drugs
your videos never appear on your channel i have to actively search for it i have your channel home page open right now refreshing it and it still says this video has not been uploaded i cant only find it through searching
my only argument against the wall is a it amount its gonna cost is insane and can be put towards more important things yes i dont think border control is the top of our priorities and b i read that most immigrants come on planes they just get a visitors thing and then never go home so they are just as under the radar as if they were to cross the border basically making the wall completely ineffective dont ask me what the solution is if its not a wall cause i dont know i just dont think the wall is a practical solution correct me if im wrong
imagine if there wasnt a border period there would be tens of thousand of illegals coming over how would they live these illegal aliens would steal social security numbers have jobs under someone elses name open home loans and car loans under someone elses name sending money over to mexico to help others cheat the system once arrested for these two crimes houses would go into foreclosure cars repossessed and families torn apart and communities destroyed the actions of what many on the left say is no big deal these illegals can in effect destroy our country periodwe need a stronger wall we need stronger laws on the book as a deterrant for criminals and no amnesty become a citizen and quit cheating and stealing the upside many lives will become more safe periodlastly trump and his team need to address the major safety issues where these families are fleeing from they wont feel afraid if less bad guys around as well
it killed me that the guy in the white shirt was initially just describing legal immigration
stevens face at the end priceless
the guy with the camera is pulling shit out of his ass
im kind of scared to resume the video after those first 10 seconds lol
its like the immigration crisis in europe where the un is going insane
spanish my fucking balls sack scientifical huh this stupid mother fucking wet back beaner fuck should just kill himself what a retarded piece of shit maybe he should talk to his masterminds about not being a turd before he runs for office what a piece of horse shit this moron is
tax them  they do already pay taxes  these are things that i hear this is from the same people who say undocumented immigrant im not sure what part of undocumented they dont understand
is the guy tripping balls or
everyone will be micro chipped  change my mind   free vaccinations chipping  change my mind  trust me i am totally against the micro chip however would be chipping all criminals be out of the question   talk about a solution that will draw fire from all politics religion law abiding citizens illegals etc  let me get a 6 pack before you air that one  drones flying the border shooting micro chips  careful what you ask for from the tech world  beep beep
xray gatesssssssssss by the future governor of new mexico
you need to do this again
this is gold
should be easier to get here legally but harsher punishment for illegally shit sucks 12 years for approval unless by marriage 3  5 years is more reasonable imo
i am sorry but i have to disagree on this because most illegal immigrants came here legally but their visas expired so now they are illegal immigrants and the wall is too expensive to create and maintain
interviews with total mongos the wall is a redundant idea because the majority of illegal immigrants come into the usa on tourist visas via a fking airplanes look at the stats
x r a y   b o r d e r
why waste the money you have plenty of fucking drones or even a camera would do lol youd still need someone to watch and act when people try and climbdig or we so whats the point of a wall makes no sense and plenty of better ways chump train is getting old its a dumb idea lol
most of the mexicans i know in texas are pro trump and the wall and more conservative than i am  but they live near the border and get to see the people that have died because we dont have a border and hear from family about the people we dont want here
likea i dont knowa like written xraya when im the givoner of new mexicoa know what im sayinga
im thinking perhaps we should have a test for everyone to vote  these dumb bastards dont even know what they are thinking the fact that they can vote is really scary i suggest a fictional character to run like a telatubby or something of that nature see how many votes it gets or maybe something more simple like a shape  i vote triangle
the guy at 430 looks like hes on drugs
this guy is dumber than a box of rocks
leeroy is the type of person who believes that scientists are moments away from inventing the miracle pill that will grant us all immortality just any day now technology will fix everything
no do this again find someone who actually disagrees
1057 proper scientifical xray gate  you heard it here folks
plz build the wall
oh crowder i forgot damn i zoned out and thought i was watching idiocracy for a minute
xray gate hahahahaahahha
wat a dumbass messican lmfaooaoaooaoaoao
this dude is on something
i dont like people coming into america illegally but the wall would be expensive at around 25 billion to build itd easily be one of the most expensive single pieces of infrastructure in american history it would cost as much as 20 hoover dams or the entirety of nasas annual budget and also the fact that immigrants still come illegally by planeits estimated that between 27 and 40 percent of all undocumented immigrants came here on planes i just dont believe the wall is the best decision hope you see thissourceshttpwwwnasagovcontentreachfornewheightsnasabudgetunveiledforfiscalyear2016httpwwwpolitifactcompunditfactstatements2015sep08jorgeramosramos40undocumentedimmigrantscomeair
i canta standa the guya in the white shirta
the fortnite stink bomb seems like a really cool concept but im not really sold on it just yet it only does 5 damage per second and the blast radius isnt that good you have to be a really bad player to dye by it overall i think it will just be another item that you get out of chest but never take fortnite needs to stop adding items like this and instead make huge gameplay changes to boost the longevity of the game the bloom mechanic for pistols and auto rifles needs to go leave some feedback in the comments below thank you
are there american citizens who are adding to the potjust because i have garbage in my house dont mean im obligated to take in your garbage
aspergers its a terrible thing
i love the lady in the intro funniest thing today
there is already a wall why build another one most illegals are there because they have overstayed their visas
i feel the wall is way too expensive of a project and you can just dig tunnels or climb over it i wish more people came in legally but i also want people who are in dire situations to come to a safe place i feel like we should be more lenient to familys coming here illegally and forcing them to become legal or get deported
call ice
if that had been chopped in to pieces i would have assumed crowder edited it to make that kid look like an idiot buuuut since he didnt theres only explanation that kid was an idiot
i just dont think the wall would be very effective its an expensive project yet i feel like people could easily dig under it climb over it or go around it
the sad thing is that kid could sit down and watch this video and think he sounded very intelligent
simple accounting ledger httpsenmwikipediaorgwikieconomicimpactofillegalimmigrantsintheunitedstates if they cost more than they provide in economic benefit they are a hindrance and they want more
instead of a wall we should just build an invisible doggy fence and put shock collars on all the mexicans so if they try to cross the boarder they get 10000 volts to the jugular
did this dude just propose chipping the us population so the government would know where we are at all times this guy is delusional
whats more expensive      a 10000 mile wallor a 10000 mile xray
that last guy was painful and typical of the low iq who strangely do not know they are low iq
so he needs masterminds to give blatant details of the xray border
that look at the end just secured that we both know those people were bonkers
x  rays blasters causing instant cancer mutations niiiiice 
well that was the most useless 13 minutes of my day
china has a wall and everybody calls it great im just saying
i am amazed at the lack of thought put into this guys argument if you cant funnel them through a point of entry how can you xray or tax these people that is kind of the point of having a wall to make them responsibly enter the country so they can be taxed and what ever else this guy wants to do with them
this second guy does not reflect my reasonings for being against the wall that guy was very uneducated on the subject
lets build the waaaaaaaaaaaaahhhrip waluigi
are u fuvkin kidding me an xray wall retarded as fuckbuild the wall build the wall
people are not very informed about immigrantion or becoming a resident get educated people like the 2nd guy he sadly ignorant and talking about the mark of the beast chip them not good 
the iq is off of the charts
holyshit watching your show hurts my brain to see how utterly ignorant individuals truly are what the hell is happening to our country insanity zero common sense
since when its normal to cuss and swear in public like that so uncivilized
i like mexican food
an xray gate lol
no wall but xray wall is okay  wtf
so he wants us to tag them and track them like animals
waited for this topic
is that my mom
my brain just crasheddude electronically tag them so they get scanned when they go throughsteven how do you make them go through the scanner without the walldude make them go through a xray scannerme   same question as crowder just asked how do you make em go through any kind of portal without a wall to impede them and block them from bypassing said portal
tag em tax em treat em live livestock thats ok but noooooo dont build that big scary wall fuck sake these people are brain dead
free tommy 
building a wall is literally waste of money most immigrants come on over stayed visas
god please be with the state of new mexico when he becomes the governor
illegals of any race religion or creed should be treated like the invading armies  they are agents at the border should be given a standing shoot to kill order anytime an illegal is encountered at the border or anywhere on us soil illegal immigration would cease to exist almost immediately change my mind
btw your expression at the very end says it all  is priceless your face my sentiments exactly
its not that he doesnt want a wall he just doesnt want a wall you can see invisible walls in 2020
lord jesus steven you couldve just waited and gotten someone smart why do you only show the dumbassess bring back yousef
anyone have a link to the statistics showing that illegal immigrants commit over 30 of homicides
dear crowder this doesnt count
did that 2nd dude just advocate for a dystopian totalitarian state  cuz thats what it sounds like
the first lady is more common than you think
whouhisuhsellinuhthe drugsuhuhkind of blows my mind how ignorant this specific dude was it wont slow down so give in dont have borders but have passports electronically tag people with barcodes like the holocausthave an xray scanner at the border check points even though there arent bordersgovernor of his own ass
dude i dig the walther shit but i didnt know you did these things with no pants sheesh
wasnt his description of a checkpoint the exact same thing as a border crossing the only difference is we implant an electronic chip with a vin into individuals so as to track their time and whereabouts as theyre in the country thats almost 1000 worse than trying to cross the border legally no passports thats an old hat lets implant a microchip in these tourists much like we do with our pets when we take them to the vet such a great free thought that took him the last three years to come up with
this guy talks about making the illegals pay a tax and they are putting money back into the economy i call bs they send the money back to mexico for there families i want to know why the mexican government is not helping there own people
yes apply extra taxes to those who we cannot track that makes sense did he not realize that if they were documented enough to tax then they would probably be here legally why stop at governor anything is possible when you can just scan people when they run across an invisible line
goodness its like these people want to go up by going down or go left by going right
jesus christ that guy was retarded i really dont think he understood how checkpoints or walls work
that guy you interviewed just gave me brain cancer what a fucking moron that guy is dios mio
feminism isnt needed change my mind
that was kind of rough i guess people would rather scream and yell than have conversations about this topic
when brain storming ideas it helps to have a brain fyi
the uhhhh proper scientifical ray for uhhhh the job yeah this guy is clueless
that guy is fucking fried
i dont even know what to say about that spanish dude um dumbshit uneducated and a lack of common knowledgesense build the wall and get this shit over with without borders you have no country or security we lock our homes why not our border same situation keeping people out that shouldnt be therehere
trump will be elected for a 2nd term this is why
he would have to sit down and think about it but he was so quick to have an opinion lol
lol free thought  talking out his ass
i honestly believe mexico would benefit more from the wall than the us
am i the only guy who thinks the spanish fucker is genuinely messed up in the head like the way he talks
i feel likelike i shouldnt beat up on the mentally handicaphe was obviously a sperg of some sorts
we need two walls one for mexico  one for canada change my mind
steven was their really no one better that guy was an absolute idiot lol
lol an xray border dudes high af
i lost brain cells listening to this thanks crowder
so one of the problems is that the wall can stop immigrants from leaving the states back to mexico  which can possibly affect certain family structures where a parent work for their family in the usa and send money back to their families in mexico it will also put the usa into even more debt than they already are in
at 500 im not mexican im from spanish my family has been in new mexico since the 1550s around therelol lolthat dumbass motherfucker sound like he just crossed the border 1 year agolol lol
it hurt to listen to the guy in the white shirt and backpack it just hurt to listen to him
that spanish guy was coked off his ass
sounds like everyone wants the wall but dont realize it
yusef was better
he reached a new level of stupidity hahaha
bro this was some super low hanging fruit this could have been a great conversation that could have brought in some viewpoints that i would love to know about because im against the wall and id love to hear your points on this i really wish you posted this when you had a conversation with someone that had some solid points
steven does an excellent job of correcting the other persons misconceptions without making them feel like theyre being attacked
buddy are you high right now
cant tell if that guy was mentally ill on crack or just a regular dumb liberal  sadly that is the new american guessing game
the walk wont help much i think we need to support the border to make sure less people cross like a security with when people fly over and then dont come back we need to make them get a ticket back and if they just dont go make them keep buying a ticket until they show up and leave
soccer is gay as fuck change my mind
please more change my mind vids
these morons want illegals to poor in to the country but they will be the first ones to cry when their neighborhoods are infested with crime because of said illegals and when they are struggling to pay bills because they are paying to support these lowlives who flood into our countryliberals live in a fairy tale where it rains money and they get everything they want without really having to work for it
i think pouring money into a wall is a bad idea change my mind
modern political viewpoint vs ideological fantasy land dreamworld
dude coming in with his own podcast is a fucking moron holy fuck that dude has a double digit iq and this dude is pro rfid chip holy shit what fucktard listens to this fucktards podcast crowder love your stuff brotha but cant finish this video dude is just too fucking dumb you were way too nice
lets build the wall up in canada as well stop them from transporting weed and drugscome on bro lets get real yes lets enfore the law on illegal immigration which it hasnt happenedthe wall will coast way to much money lets just hire more border potrol to enfore boarderheres an other option if americans would stop buying drugs from mexico you wouldnt have a 3rd world country where everyone in there mom wants to come here its not just the mexicans coming in here illegally its chinese japanese cubans european etcits a hole network of races that come in illegallythis has been a problem for many years but yet where focused on it in 2018 cause the president tells us to focus on it really  how about us going into syria do we not care about that or that slowly our rights are being stripped from us how corporate companies own this country how my vote doesnt count why are we all of the sudden focus on race when mager events are happening now today wake up yes lets start enforcing really enforcing illegal immigration but not at the coast of a billion dollar walllets creat jobs hire more board agents and have the government really do their job and crack down on drug houses weapon houses instead of stuffing they pockets with laws that benefit major corporate companies
that guy is on an acid trip
cant wait for the new xray scanners across the usmexico border already started a gofundme
im finding stats more around a 1213 of murders committed by non citizens not 30am i missing somthing
 wow 
so this guy approves of monitoring american citizens wow im so awe struck of how clueless this guy is i cant put all my thoughts into writing  just wow
 you know you can tax them  make money off them you know not like make them slaves or anything like that  you can also scan them digitally  things like that you know maybe use an xray machine scanner nope
i love watching jared in the background
that hispanic male is a complete ignorant who has an infinitesimal cranium he spews vapid statements period hes a sorry excuse
hopefully drugsa become a thing of the pasta
he reminds me of damon wayans character on in living color who would also butcher english  lol
the wall wont really work though
xray border instead of a green card the will have cancer to show they got here legally
at no point in your rambling incoherent responsewereyou even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is nowdumber having listenedto it i award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul
you have to redo this topic
maybe we dont need a border wall just some kind of border funnel to cram all the crossers through so they can show us their note and get their junk xrayd over the long spans of the border this funnel might look like a wall but its really just a funnel with a big beautiful door for all to pass through good thinkin trump erm i mean leroy
that dudes family has been in america since the 1500s yet his accent sounds like he just came across illegally yesterday 
they will tunnel under the wall a wall wont do shit
something i dont understand is why not make laws or enforce more of it towards criminals that are illegal that just come in and screw things up plus a wall it will cost billions and billions of dollars plus me personally i think the government is deporting the wrong people the once that have family and working hard and just want a life should slide and the once that are criminal acts should be deported immediately plus immigration is more focused on mexicans but what about people from europe asia australia and other countries that immigrants do come from
this new mexico spaniard is an libtard idiot built the wall keep out all illegal aliens
why dont we just dig up an unreasonably large canyon as the border instead of building a wall that way the democrats get what they want and dont get a wall while theres still a way to limit the possibility of crossing just a joke
guy is literally advocating for a one world surveillance based governmentserious 1984 level stuff lol
not my new mexican oh hes a trujillo might be my cousin yikes
lol checkpointwallborder people dont get it
that guys a few fries short of a happy meal
go green global im thinking he was pretty high and id bet 5 his channel is about weed
1029 abort abort your about to say some stupid shit homes
the guy from new mexico is an idiot
soooo what i see is that everyone agreed on not having illegal immigrants but what they dont agree on is the physical wall
yesssss its here
yeah i wanna run for governor of a state that i believe should cease to exist within a country i believe should cease to exist vote for me    the second moron
did that guy just suggest we chip the worlds population like a dog so we can know whe and who enters country
liberals shouting obscenities and mindless insults instead of engaging in thought provoking discussion    quit joshin steven
trump needs to build a wall around the sanctuary states
i am against building the wall because those who want to cross will find a way any how over under or through it so i dont see it being efficient in the long run and we will be waiting too much money on it plus the upkeep
literally the easiest arguing point is financing no one even tried or they did
hes one scientifical mastermind
this second dude in the interview is genuinely the dumbest person ive ever heard speak
if you put a mark on someones right hand or forehead then you can track them and let them be able to buy and sell not like that hasnt been foretold
i cant even with this guy from new mexico he is too stupid to listen to by a lot
facepalmgif it may be an old gif but its the proper gif tonight
what in the fuck is this retard talking about
giant xray machine from the future governor bahahahaha
i agree with border security bit i dont think a wall would work and it would just just waste tax dollars  you ever the tv show weeds they made an underground tunnel the entire underground would be like an ant colony
that beginning tho xddddddddd
to anybody that wants an open border i ask you do you have a door on your home do you lock your door at night if you do thats the same reason there should be a border wall we dont want to keep everyone out we want to make sure whoever comes into our country is doing it legally but please if you are against this open your doors and post a sign on your lawn saying you have an open household and get back to me when you change your mind
scientifical
what in the flying fuck an xray gate instead of a border wallthat guy actually thought to himself alright i got this
i understand letting the man talk but did you have to put it on your channel seriously if i wanted to talk to someone that high i would go to any fast food place at 1 am
the second person was talking outta his ass the entire time lol
wtf are those arguments
i think that guy needs to detox for a bit
the dude talks like hes torqued out of his mind
what the fuck did i just watch
steven must get so tired of dealing with these unintelligent morons on the brightside they probably make him seem even smarter than he actually is
wow this one was surprisingly lame really flat not because of you but as you said not a lot of people wanted to talk it was refreshing to hear a hispanic women though at least disapproving of the illegal situation she may not like the wall idea but at least she doesnt support illegals either i respect that as for the other guy he is just going to go for the latino vote in his city when he runs for office if even does  because he was saying mostly no nonsensical gibberishtalking points
xrays bahahahahahaahhahahahaa
better start building that wall now thers no way trump will win in 2020 libs learned there lesson they will come out in hordes and vote in 2020
this is dumb asf the majority of ppl that are living here illegally came legally and overstayed their visas capitalism thrives off of cheap labor american citizens commit more crimes per capita than undocumented immigrants notice how crowder didnt mention his sources which most of the time are very misleading or wrong illegals stimulate the economy and pay taxes and no one is calling for open borders ffs
the second guy couldve had a point but wtf lol
do a colab with hunter avallone
what a nice completely misguided man
lol he just blatantly lied illegal immigrants make up 37 of homicides in america anyone can fact check that online and find out thats complete bullshit you just comes off as convincing so the stupid people they purposely pick to interview believe him and look stupid these shows are so scripted with the people they pick
says his family has been here for hundreds of years but cant speak english
i think the build the wall statement is ridiculous we blow money for something when we cant secure the opposite end of the wall they can literally dig tunnels as they have done so in the past they can also blow down the wall through sections with american patrols being unable to do anything as the culprits would be in a whole other jurisdiction the wall would only be another expense for us to build and also something for us to maintain
im not even an american but you do  need a wall  you have too many illegal immigrants  its not right
i think that enforcement is necessary but at least maybe we should make it faster to legally immigrate as far as i have read most illegal immigration occurs because they are too afraid to try and legally immigrate but be turned away
1138 i dunno i one day plan on being the governor of new mexico  dufuq steven that was gold right there buddy
im pretty sure that the first woman does not master the languaje im not saying this despectively im mexican
x ray border 
lmao if there coming through illegally their not going to have a hand written note to explain why they want to come to america who would they give it to there coming over hidden
i can actually debate this one building the wall would spell disaster economically because most illegal immigrants arent crossing at the border but at airports im all for security in the border but we should focus our security in airports rather than the already existing border control down south however i appreciate your work crowder keep it up
the second guy is an absolute moron my god he was trying so hard to sound intelligentbut failed spectacularly
did he say he is going to run for governor im dead 
do you actually believe in these statements and are arguing for them or are you simply arguing for the statements to have conversations
614 illegal immigrants commit crimes at greater rates and a disproportionate level sourcehttpswwwcatoorgpublicationsimmigrationresearchpolicybriefcriminalimmigrantstexasillegalimmigrantfor all criminal convictions in texas in 2015 illegal immigrants had a criminal conviction rate 56 percent below that of nativeborn americansdo you have any issues with the methodology or conclusion of this study
did that guy say his family has been in new mexico since 1550
that hispanic guy is not the sharpest tool in the shed
730 this happens when low iq uninformed oerson explains policy he does not understandelectronic id checked by technology is styl a border oh my god and this person walks freely among us iq 80
lol  this is proof liberalism is a mental disorder
wouldnt an xray border cost ten times more the a normal wall
good luck with the governors race bud hahahaha
wow mind blown 
xray wall magaagain 2044
just have them pay taxesyou mean the fuckers taking welfare and acting as a massive net negative to our economy we should just let criminals go and ask them to never commit crimes again i mean not all of them will be repeat offenders
leeroy blewuh my minduh
when stephen gave him that look and said an xray border to that guy i lost it 
dude you are the worst conservative ever that wall is a joke those guys tunnel their people miles trump and you are both fucking retarded waste of money our money by the way fuck you crowder youre like the equivalent of an sjw for the right wing and its like i cant even get a base camp set up because youre so retarded that i dont want to follow people like you just like with the sjws and the democrats trying to do all this crazy shit thats why i dont follow them either the walls dumb youre dumb trumps really fucking dumb
mexico is our third biggest trading partner if we build a wall it will slow trade and in some cases halt it many businesses will fail and it would hurt the economy
the dude in the second interview was an idiot
location location location  i think you put your table in the wrong place
geez whiz leroy needs to try the decaf his mouth is running faster than his brain can keep up i sure hope there is a part 2 to this where you can find some half decent conversation
im not mexican im spanish from the 1550s who came to mexico no youre mexican
tax them repeat repeat repeat should have shown the statistics of how much money the government spends on illegal immigrants or how much monetary value the benefits they receive living in our society is vs how much they actually do pay in taxes now its uuugggeee loss make them pass the test how the fuck do you make somebody pass a test requiring them to pass the test is already the fucking metric we use so yous ant the current rules so why are you crying about it or do you want to let everyone pass no matter what that dude was a fucking idiot parading as intelligent
yes the magical xray wall will keep the illegals out xdxd that guys was respectfully an idiot
what the fuck is this guy saying
to be honest posting this wasnt the greatest thing because it could put her in danger even with her face blurred out
you could have a gate for them to go throughno wall no gate genius
i just lost 13 brain cells listening to himat some point i blacked out and forgot where i was 
so invite the entire world to the usa and you get a citizenship if you pass a testthere are what 65 million refugees in the world you would have alot of desperate people comingand behind them the poor that can make it
holy shit is everyone that disconnected from reality or is it just leftists
look at jarrod just cooling in the back 
i expected steven to bring up trumps plan to provide a path to citizenship for 18 million illegal immigrants in exchange for funds to build the wall
shes afraid of killersthe face blur doesnt helplook at her body shape and her clothing the bag the watch her hairshes death by now
never give this mexican dude an ounce of power hes authoritarian scum
guy at the end was a idiot
i still think theres a more elegant solution to the wall profiling is the best way to go imo
lmao even the democrats wanna report and deport them hahahahahahahaha
after watching this i completely understand why this one was only 13 minutes long
that one guy is so dumb
this guy is not very smart
this guy is painfully stupid
yeah lets tax illegal immigrantswho have no job or moneyand dont pay taxes anywaybrilliant
the first interview legitimately hurt my heart i know quite a few mexicans all legal for my areas demographics and while in my particular state they dont have to fear much they absolutely hate illegal immigrants many of which are extended family who didnt want to go through the process and just wanted the benefits of our broken healthcare system and since they cant function in society being illegal aliens theyve resorted to crime it makes my friends incredibly depressed because of what their extended family or friends of the family are choosing to do and its hurting them because the illegals reputation hurts the reputation of legal immigrantsi for one am not sure building a physical wall will help a ton for how much itll cost in the long run but i do support more strict enforcement and perhaps greater security presence on the border i dont claim to be an expert but im definitely on the side of enforcing legal immigration and doing what is necessary and feasible to prevent illegal aliens from entering
hey guys  i just took on 120000 in debt and its all about to pay off  ready for this  wait for it  xray border  boomps  im also going to be the governor of new mexico one day
did that psychopath just casually suggest some ultra big brother dystopia that could monitor every persons every move wowwe need a flood
these people live in the land of make believe
of course an xray border and trackers what
jaredyou packing in that fanny
pretty much everything the guy said already exists all an immigrant has to do is claim asylum at the border right if they are legit then they can start becoming legal it takes forever and i see that is kind of sucky but why hop the border
his family has been here since the 1500s but cant speak proper english lol
the last guy proves smoking drugs does have lasting effects
i can just see people avoiding the xray border wrapped in aluminium foil
that dudes either on cocaine mentally ill or both
poor lady
i have an idea how about the us takes over mexico expands the us and bam no more borders
an x  ray fence  leroy is smoking some dop shit while watching star trekk for some past month you will still need a wall alongside the x ray scanner cos making the whole lenght of border x ray enabled would cost more than the large hedron collider
i dont support a wall  i support like an invisible system bla bla bla  ok so you support an invisible wall  wow typcial illogical reasoning of todays leftist generation
so we shouldnt have a wall but we should tag people in some sort of dystopian information gathering service on everyone everywhere goodness that sounds a lot worse than a wall
holy crap leroy gets a vote  think about that
so he said that he doesnt want a wall but wants an xray machine what if they just walk around the xray
is the second dude comes from 2118
so the idea for an xray border came from go greenthe irony maybe the green he meant was radioactive glow green
this ones gonna be a good one lol
im not too against the xray border wall stoner camera boy might have stumbled into something great
looking at the news these days more and more i just keep saying this to myselfbuild the wall enough is enough
i think that guy may give ben shapiro a run for his money on who talks faster
a little unrelated man but if i were you id be bragging about my wife like she was a trophy and i just won a championship i mean my goodness
it could be like a x ray scannerwhat fucking timeline does this guy think hes living in
debate1  not the sharpest knife in the boxdebate2  a knife that cant even find the box   im planning on being the governor of new mexico  oh shit 
i would be more open to immigrants coming to the us and working if there was no guarantee of citizenship we didnt have the vast welfare programs we currently have and they paid taxes just like us citizens until we cut our welfare programs allowing illegal immigrants to come and benefit from us citizens taxed welfare programs is unfair and perpetuates the problem if they had to be taxed and couldnt benefit from our welfare programs many illegal immigrants would be less likely to come here

i want what leeroy smokes
ah building the wall making the borders more secure i guess these would be my argumentaccording to research by massey durand and pren from 2016 if policymakers had done nothingnever increased the border patrols funding beyond keeping pace with inflationthe undocumented population would likely have grown substantially less  aside from doing nothing however there were other policy options available to officials beyond attempting to suppress migration through police actions at the border one such option would be to accept mexican migration as a natural component of ongoing economic integration under the north american free trade agreement  between naftas implementation in 1994 and 2010 for example total trade between mexico and the united states rose 53 times while according to data from the office of immigration statistics 2014 entries by business visitors increased 36 times exchange visitors 62 times tourists 121 times intracompany transferees 174 times and treaty investors more than a thousand times within an integrated economy people inevitably will be moving other options could include policies to encourage return migration such as lowering the cost and risk of remitting us earnings paying tax refunds to returned migrants making legal immigrants eligible for us entitlements even if they return to mexico and cooperating with mexican authorities to create attractive options for savings and investment south of the border the billions of dollars wasted on counterproductive border enforcement would have been better spent on structural adjustment funds channeled to mexico to improve its infrastructure for public health education transportation communication banking and insurance to build a stronger more productive and more prosperous north america and eliminate the motivations for migration currently lying in ineffective markets for insurance capital and credit massey 2009and yes there are better measures to ensure the safety of the borders than pumping the money in one way would be an approach described by amy ding 20141 estimate the number of illegal bordercrossings that occur stochastically during an r time period see the research for formulae2 link this with desired patrol effectiveness to determine the number of required patrol teams see the research for formulae
theres no way the kid in the white shirt is a real person i simply refuse he isnt an actor
he was saying just surrender america reistance is futile we will conquer you
thumbs up for the xray border
that young dude rambling on is an idiot and obviously knows nothing about the worldomg hes rambling on an on an on an on   shut the fuck upsorry crowder i cant finish watching this video because of that idiots rambling
the thought process of a libtard caught on tape xray digital scanners because technology makes thing go so fast that you dont really need borders because illegal immigrants want to pay taxes
me
spanish guy brawndos got what plants crave
shes probably from arizona we just deal with that kinda shit every day we get along ok though obviously things could be betterlike if violent criminals wouldnt be blocked from deportation by whoever has power over the executive branch
get an ad for the previous change my mind while watching this
i wish you would come to montana
leeroy was being pretty civil actually
that face at the end lmao
oh no
that dude in the white shirt is a fucking idiot
like the vans
100 of illegal aliens committed a crime become they hoped a boarder and are here illegally
walls have never worked and spending all of that money on a wall would be pointless considering that most illegal immigrants come here in planes and work visas so a wall would do nothing to stop that a fraction of illegal immigration comes from people crossing the border directly i agree thought we need to stop illegal immigration i just dont think a wall is the smart way to do it
fuck the wall and fuck brain dead trump supporters changemymind
im 100 for a more secure border but i never really understood the point of the wall isnt it just a fence that just cost more to repair im severely uninformed on the wall and if you have information that could help me understand by all means tell me
that guy in the white shirt does not stfu
im sorry like i really am and i hate saying this but that spanish guy was so stupid he was either stupid or just poorly poorly educated
crowder heres why i support the wallit is a deterrent it prevents people from coming in period of course people are still going to get in theyll find some way why secure the border this is a country this isnt a freerange wilderness open to the settling of migrant people we have laws and customs we have a national language and standard way of life people from the third world are bringing their standards of living to this country they are turning this country into a third world because this is how they are used to living in mexico central america etc have you been to any home depot here in vegas the illegals camp out around the store looking for work bless their hearts but they leave giant trash bags full of waste bits of clothes here a discarded shoe there a lone plastic piece of packaging of some type hanging from a tree branch blowing in the windthis is exactly what mexico and central america look like
that dude is retardedand this dude votes fml
very weak participants on this one
an xray border 
ending was priceless
xray border ohh boy thats a good one  just tax them in general make them a legal citizenwe already have this system in effect we have id numbers social security numbers we already have international documentation passports the issue is that we have no way of forcing people to abide by the rules or even pay taxes if we dont funnel them through some sort of check point with a surrounding wall
i want what hes smoking 
as long as rope and planes exist the wall wont do much
dontschu have kids mr president
the sanctuary cities are just promoting more illegal imigration and human trafficking the illegal immigrants are going to be put more in danger in their odyssey to this country prostitution organs trafficking kidnapping drugs more ear between the criminals because their will be more competition smuggling people into the country more crime will increase on both sides of the boarder they can seek asylum outside the boarders without breaking the law we have ports of entries and ambassys outside the country
at least he was respectful
can you link the numbers to show how illegals make up 30 of homicides 644
make one on veganism
deport that guy for being a dumb fuck
i think the wall is just a waste of tax money people can dig tunnels swim or boat around it maybe scale it with a grabbling hook or those tree climbing screws some people use another method is buying a plane ticket and applying for a vacation visa and never going back
what do you think that steven crowders presidential slogan be
so disappointing and hilarious at the same time 
we neeeed like some kind of xray border man and people can like leave a note as to why they are there leroy threo future governor of new mexico
that guy was probably on some drugzuh
we can only tax them if we know theyre here
youre a fucking idiot your stats are made up anyone with a cell phone and google search could shut you up in a heartbeat thats why joe rogan killed you in debate because all your bullshit fake facts were shutdown i would love to sit down with you and debate any of your previous topics because you lie and make up facts everytime you bring your fake facts i bring my cell phone no wonder you only debate children
can we all agree that building a wall is silly
he has a thick accent for his his family being here for generations
my thoughts are dont waste your time building a physical barrier as a wall  increase security using a less environmentally invasive method  fact is that no actual oldfashioned barrier will keep people out  they can easily go around your wall by boat plane bribes false identities on and on  theres plenty of high tech options that could be utilize  just check out military surveillance for ways to devise better security over already established borders  another idea  but this has to do with cooperative efforts on the other side of the border  create economic incentives for people to want to stay there  hmmm its like how tax havens work  people flock to tax haves dont they people flock to places that bring economic opportunity and better life quality   anyhow theres a few ideas  theres really multiple issues that would have to be addressed to reduce any incentive or gain for people to want to try to enter a country illegal or legal
wait do you actually believe this
what the fuck an xray border
the millennials are going to kill this country
go green globals stock price is 001
ohhhh good lordthe second dude is lost
so a gate in an invisible wall that people in good faith walk through to be scanned by xrays what do you call a gate thats not in a wall welli dont know but thats the one place they wont go dontcha think and he thought about this for the last three years but still needs to get some experts together ya think
wtf is the spanish guys talking about xray border  electronic id body scanning stuff 
i feel so bad for that legal mexican immigrant woman
x ray wall huh
lol the people trying to change your mind seem kind of slow on the uptake you might have to get jared in there or something
man leroy came off with the salute like he really did something lol go ahead leroy 
i couldnt follow this guys argument he makes no sense
dude now you lost me build the wall its stupidity from every aspect but most the economics the wall will be the last nail in your country coffin welfare its goin to ruin you by 2022 build a wall that size its not viablethe thing its reduce burocracy to imigrate and deport the ilegal or give then means to become leagland pay taxes some states have a huge portion of the manual labor dominated by illegal imigrants go in any construction site near border and just make then pay taxes oppsss become legalofcourse they will cause problems with violence becouse they dont embrace the culture they dont become american  problematic  like the oter troubled communites the problem its not race or where youre born the problem its the shitty cultureno every culture its different
its painful how dumb these people are
he didnt know what he was talking about lmao
you should censure the first lady card
so that guy is talking about lojacking all humans so we know who is where thats even more scary then a wall thats way scary
this guy is asking for chains for us all  peace
build the wall
that dudes brain was starting to short circuit
u blurred out her face but didnt blur out the id badge with her picture on her neck
check that man quick
deport leroy
wht does this guy sound high lol
so foolish these people are considered adults
these videos are great when you have a debate with someone they arent so great when all you do is interview total space cadets
how do we get smarter people to debate if they cant get anyone to sit down people dont want to debate they just want to be right
can we check that guys backpack
i have become  stupider  just from listening  to the last guy
dude wants to get a mark of the beast and doesnt even realise he is selling his soul to satan
holy fuck that dude in the white shirt needs to stop mixing adderall with cocaine
if we build some form of the wall id be happy at least walls in areas to keep the illegal immigrants from getting themselves killedthat way fatalities are lowered and the ones that show up can be safely returned back to where they came
you should do the same topic in southern california 
i like your videos but what reactions did you expect from people a lot of people see it as you being a racist if you want the wall built i understand thats not the case but us as americans why should we care if the wall is there or not it hasnt been for multiple years and hasnt effected me one bit that wall being built will actually effect me and with gas prices rising its going to effect everyone economically of course the privileged probably wont notice
im not mexican im spanish my family has been in mexico since the 1550swtf you uppity piece of
yahhhh just build the wall hahahaha edit and what in the living shit is this second guy saying we should get chipped loool and oh shit you in new mexico i do not want this dude for governor 
the last guy was really really stupid
the lgbtqaip was better
in leroy land illegal immigrants cross the border just to get free xrays
xray border scientifical lol
i absolutely love how two of my favourite shitdisturbers crowder and mcinness were canadians makes me so fucking proud good on ya lads
so if we shouldnt have any border walls then whats the point in having doors on your house  just let anybody that wants in walk in right its the same principle america is our home and if you let just anybody walk in it wont be long before we dont have a home anymore  and all the libtard rejects preaching this no border bs dam sure wont let anybody into their home will they
and im pretty sure he was high on cocaine
yes just what i wanted a government implanted chip in my body
holy fuckin xray
bless you for even hearing that guy out crowder
you should a larger video about this change my mind because its a very interesting theme but speaking whit american people
build your wall with your ass change my mind
solutionthis has to be solved in parts we take care of the people we have now and filter out everyone else that is new to the country the people here now must meet certain requirements like having been here a number of years speaking english no crime record etconce we give path to citizenship to those that deserve it we know that most people become illegal immigrants when they overstay their visa so when applying for the visa those people must explicitly put in their destination city and address so that they can get logged in some database for when the 6 months are over they know where to find that personthose that violate the rule will not have visa privileges ever again having their full information and other people to contact that know them will simplify the searching process once they realize its better to leave and then come back they will enforce the law themselves but how do we handle those crossing the border through land not with a wall you can dig a hole or jump it trust me there will be workarounds and the cost of a wall is just a terrifying number wed already taxed way too much as it is and being taxed even more to support something i dont agree with is intolerable i think the biggest influence for catching people would be to invest in more border patrol safety also its important to have some internal analysis on the areas that have more people caught and improve the surveillance around those areasi do think something needs to be done but there is a more humane way about doing things splitting families apart sending college students back and sending people that havent been to their native land since they were 2 years old are some examples of why not every illegal immigrant deserves to be sent back
that guy is  a moron  wow and hes allowed to vote lol
when you trying to talk about politics and the guy talks about cyberpunk
wow this dude who sits down lives in sci fi land
heres my proposal lets keep the border open if you come here illegally and murder or rape or commit any kind of assault or harm on an american citizen you are executed without a trial if youre here illegally you cannot obtain any support from any social program at all and doing so means you will be deported to columbia where you will be turned into a slave to produce drugs if youre here illegally you must report every single penny you earn in employ to the irs and pay a flat 20 tax on top of normal income and sales taxes if youre here illegally you may not own property and you may not vote you may not drive and you are banned from consuming alcohol that seems like a fair trade for illegal residence if theyre willing to put up with that shit and can make it with those taxes i honestly dont mind them being here
tag people we could just setup barcode machines and have people tattooed it could work they did it in the movie idiocracy 
what the fk did i just watch lmaooooooo
the wall is gonna be expensive tho but im with you
thank you for doing this on my birthday i really wanted this one we need them illegals gone an d im a brazilian legal immigrant and us citizen
an xray gate beam me up gustavo
im against the wall but just because i think guard towers with snipers would be much cheaper
how can we expect people who dont exist undocumented illegals to be held accountable and pay a tax we should apparently tattoo a barcode to identify them maybe a xray border would work and if there are no more borders that would effectively end the drug war theres so much flawed logic in this guys brain i dont think anyone on the left has spend 5 seconds thinking about this issue because their ideology wont allow any deviation from the globalist agenda
yeah guys just tax em just stop them while theyre walking across the border and tax them its so easy and simple fucking really
hispanics arent very smart its rare you speak to one that can articulate themselves very well that guy made my brain itch
tag em   lol
whoever wants it built should pay for it change my mind
an xray border huh 
id rather see the funds go to something better i mainly worry about the maintenance costs after a wall is built the us military is already drinking a lot of money due to maintenance of older vehicles etc and they keep reducing funding on other things like education and security to keep feeding the military theres no way they can reduce anything else to fund the wall without harming other important and necessary things
xray wall baby
that idiot could very well be the next governor of new mexico his accent was a strange latin italiano
1030 wtf xrays and chips inside people i think he said he needed a group of masterminds to come up with a solution lol
someone please make a xray border meme about leeroy
can we at least have some educated folks debate you lol its easy to shit on idiots
what was that
example of dumb people talking all these unicorn shit then put it on imaginary mastermind people to solve the problem btch there is no winwin solution there is bad and worse grow the fk up and pick your poison
losing interest in these conversations im fairly liberal and have really enjoyed crowders positions on most issues and helping me question my positions however watching him debate or converse with people who have little to bring to the conversation is really killing this series  id love to see crowder debate anyone who is actually educated in these topics because honestly change my mind is never going to happenit should be called stroke my mind because basically thats all crowder does by always being far above his guests  wellexcept the one college kid who turned him into a triggered little snowflake whos feelings got hurt and he decided to be a baby about it
that homicide stat is not correct
i thought that was dean cain in thumbnail
tax them 92 of migrants are on food stamps and nearly 63 are on ssi disability so how exactly do you benefit the nation by importing migrants who by massive margins absorb tax money and dont pay crap
by the way this guy is talking is the reason we dont need mexicans theyre the dumbest breed ever
seriously dude
i know exactly where that lady pov is coming from i know you do these shows around the dallas metroplex and as a latina who lives in dallas the amount of illegals that do crime here is just so bad yes there are good hard working illegal immigrants but sometimes when you see more bad then good something gotta change my neighborhood thats filled with hispanics secretly voted for trump because they also saw how the community was just deteriorating and how unsafe it was starting to become due to illegals doing so much crime
that guy was either really naive or really stupid
the second person sounds high obviously he doesnt live in la illegals are destroying this citythat guy was just bullshitting you
trump is orange change my mind
this is political hackery at its best folks lets forget that twothirds of all illegal immigrants overstay their visas lets forget that net migration to the united states is negative lets forget that a continuous wall is unfeasible across one of the longest geopolitical borders in the world lets forget that these people risk their lives and everything they own to come to the promised land with more drive and less entitlement than most natives would ever have but i forgot steven crowder just wants republican views for ad revenueyou should be ashamed
445 but todays standardstoday standards are raising the bar back to where it needs to benot where you want them to be
bro 13 minutesneed more cowbell baby i mean crowder lol
he plans on being the governor of new mexico 
complete respect for the guy who wants to build xray borders but no sort of technology exists except for extremely expensive gps trackers
organize local militias to protect the boarder that or bring in the french foreign legion
cheap maybe a lil lol
how come none of the msm have mentioned that turkey has just built a wall against the border with syria
414  shadeswearing jared mcbadass at your cervix
stephen seemed a lot moreannoyed in this episode
so she sits down believing shes for illegal immigration  and leaves wanting to know how to deport those wet backs crowder went beast mode
did anybody else think of the movie coneheads when that last guy was talking lets just put an invisible line with shock collars on all the deportees lol
 hey i wanna enforce the laws and have people come here legally bro that wall thats mean wat
the argument i hear the most against the wall is breaking up families and turning away people who need asylum the thing people do not realize is that when you have a ton of different people believing different things the country goes to hell take a look at europe there are so many horrible things reported in the news the guy being interviewed was trying to sound like an intellectual it did not make him look very smart
this dude living in the year 3028
trump is not paying taxes either
im from new mexico and to think this haphazardly thinking dude spitting out word vomit is exactly the mind set i moved away fromlol i would say run for governor but in todays world he might just make it but at least then i would know im never moving back to nm haha
oh my god how is that idiot even smart enough to keep breathing
build a wall on canada
scientifical love it wants to be governor scientifical wow
love how you interact with these people and how you are so cordial even with people who are rude
you guys should do a change my mind out here in la on the wall andor guns
reasons for no border  wall1 the wall would have a massive negative environmental impact and many scientists are already concerned about the effects of what the current limited wall is doing to the wildlife the proposed idea of expanding the wall has the fish and wildlife service and scientist concerned even more about 100 plant and animal species which are already considered endangered would be affected by the wall along with approximately another 800 different species many of these species have the area around the us mexico border considered to be a critical habitat dividing up the area could be fatal to the wildlife and would split up even more species2 27 or more that was the lowest percentage i could find some of the others were above 60 of illegal immigrants come by plane and overstay their visas3 if the wall covered the entire border it would be 2000 miles long which would cost over 15 billion4 the wall would cut through rough terrain along with villages rivers mountains and peoples homes5 maintaining and staffing the wall would cost taxpayers forever i would bring up more statistics about illegal immigrants but i already know that the sources that i would use to make these claims are going to be considered bias when compared to your sources which i consider biasthe war on drugs is a failure and you could easily say that it has made the situation worse in some ways so saying it makes the drug war really hard 1215 in the context of no border wall is false the war on drugs has lowered the price of drugs
god bless leroy the look at the end lol
the clueless moron was confident enough in his ideas that he recorded himself 
that dude is straight up psycho
lol the women ready to get real
its your fault he wouldnt shut up and you didnt stop him 
so he wants a xray border but thinks borders are a thing of the past weve got a winner over here
with the present state of new mexico i wouldnt be surprised if he was elected governor the education system in this state is depressing
stephens face at the end 
can you not find people who are of similar iq to you to spar with
yeh new mexico is fucked brainswashed socialists its majority socialist ill restate this a bit more clearly while in the us the silent majority is libertarian classical liberal the silent majority of new mexico is socialist to a degree that makes che guivvera look like ron paul especially northern half of nm
someone please take that last zoom on crowders face and turn it into the start of an office episode
steven please come to slc utah the snowflakes here would love something to throw a fit about and id love to come to one of your talks
that guy was obviously tweeted on adderall or meth
this only hinders any progress on coming up with a solution on illegal immigration i think most people just sat there after this video shaking their head in disbelief he wants a 1900 mile long weather proof xray wall wth
well this is the exact type of woman that i dont want in the country
the amount of time and money needed for the wall would take is too much but crazy things is what about those who take planes and just stay
that spanish dude is an avid thinker but not very intelligent lol
i usually enjoy these episodes but this guy reaaallllyyy made me uncomfortable and not want to watch this lol he is in another world and you were too kind to him he talked in circles for so long i started to feel stupid what is he talking about 
bless that first lady she seemed afraid  i hope things work out for her
scientifical free flowing computer engineers
wow as a new mexico citizen i hope this man never gets far in politics
the second joker was talking a bunch a bullshit
illegal immigrants take more in resources than taxes they may or may not be paying into the systemjust look at any hospital emergency room or any health care facilityand look at the public schoolsthey are dumbed down big time because of these immigrants
2 interviewee has watched too many sci fi movies   too many things he suggested are illegal aside from scanning them just tax them assuming we can find themand within the next 5 to 10 years we will be able to travel super cheap  why am i thinking of blade runner
im mexican and i dont get why people want open borders i mean about 40 of my family has come to the us and adding
hw do  rdpor he pepe
steveni just watched you video cmm build the wall for the most part it appears similar opinions and reasons keep coming up in a vicious circle people for the wall enjoy the greater sense of control and protections the wall hopes to provide this includes the hot topics of drugs citizenship taxes welfare assorted taxpayer bennifits assistance programs background checks and balances the people against the wall for one dont want it because trump does andor theyre against the expense they dont believe mexico will pay for it they claim the impact is not that big of a deal yet are still against illegal immigration they have conflicting views of the importance of secure boarders and they claim that the wall will violate the rights of immigrants amongst other things and thus the circle goes round and round  and then theres me i think both sides are wrong and hyper focusing on all the wrong things and i believe thats the way it was intended so mr crowder sit back relax and listen to be babble and i invite you to change my mind  when i was a kid id fall down and scrape my knee mom would put a bandaid on my booboo but my booboo was still there i just couldnt see it as easily i was focused on the bandaid now instead of the actual problem watching where i was going to avoid falling in the first place  we dont need our southern neighbors to cause crime for us we do just fine with that on our own for goodness sakes but you dont see us tossing up walls around the bronx but somehow the us keeps ticking on as far as im personally concerned lgbtqc c is for computer hahaha does more damage thats longer lasting for generations to come but anyways  boil it all down about the wall theres lots of issues at hand but the main ones that have always come up for years and years now and continue to come up includes gov bennifits all of them people quickly get their knickers in a twist when it comes to money everyone is looking out for themselves theres the real concern of the impact so many illegals have on the system which is struggling already anyways and theyre worried about getting whats theirs people are mostly pro wall because well mexico is paying for it afterall its a free asset protection in very real terms and wether mexico pays or not they dont care because itll still be free to them  so what am i getting at the nanny state not many people burn 100 bills and its the same with the nanny state people are not willing to abandon it why throw away an asset its typically not done yet it is my argument that is exactly what americans should be focusing on and talking about abandoning all socialist programs no matter what the cost  yes i live what i preach im unemployed right now i did not file for unemployment when i got laid off because i am not a socialist i do not believe in taking from others  but before i loose you honestly if there were no gov bennifits of any kind except for the protection of freedom what would be the dead honest problem of a nice family driving from mexico to san diego for the day with not so much more then a boarder check and perhaps a drug sniffing dog before they continued on their way while the spend money here they pay sales tax for goodness sakes the only lawful tax by the way sure theres more to it there always is but take the nipple out of the usofa peoples mouths and please explain the issue of any and all mexicans immigrating to a better place im not against the wall either not against the current boarder we currently have im simply against the greed and entitlement that these gov bennys have created our founding fathers would be ashamed of us and sorely disappointed that we have allowed these issues to get above us again and theres no garuntee with or without a wall that a mexican family will be any less lawfull or drug free then my neighbors next door does mexico have drug cartels and problems yes so do we humans suck instead of medaling in the middle east perhaps we could have been assisting with that same force within our own country and our neighbors to diminish the problems perhaps our prisons could be modeled after other countries invested in rehabilitation of inmates perhaps with a greater show of force and enforcement and consequence people would be less likely to do drugs perhaps if america didnt hate god then there could be greater moral courage and perhaps without all these gov bennys and grants maybe wouldnt be so dang entitled and lazy and depressed in the first place   sure fine go build a wall but i garuntee that it will not fix the problem itll most likely make it much worse  im not crazy im not closed minded i look at things differently i look for the constitutional element never once was the plan to flee here to tax people to death and give them free stuff taken from others and then get mad at anyone else who equally was desiring to flee their corrupt gov for a better life to the land of the free a wall really is this really what we have become  so again my friend im am neither for or against the wall but im against the reasons for both the only wall that we need is one around dc with unlocked crash bar doors opening into it and with inward facing barbed wire around the top  america is dying this wall wont fix the problemssincerely herb mason
edit her id tag fools
build the xray
i love your videos and i agree with your points 90 the time this however hits pretty close to home im a 19 year old latino from mexico i dont particularly care for the wall as i do understand that illegal immigration is not okay however this illegal immigration has happened many times throughout history biggest example european settlers fleeing religious persecution embarked ships and set sail to find a new land to be able to exercise these new beliefs another example would be swedish migration towards western united states in the 19th century due to the massive rise in population this concept isnt new and everybody has a different perspective there are times where it is okay to use a lawful compass and there are other cases where many prefer using a moral one i have had a work permit for about 4 years now and this work permit allowed me to study to get a drivers license and drive legally this work permit allowed me to come out of the shadows and get a social security number this work permit allowed me to work legally and allows me to file my taxes when people like the trump administration mislead and spread pseudo knowledge other people who know no better end up following his morale and decide to agree with them this creates separation within the nation and screws people over who pay 1500 to renew this permit per 2 year gaps im not saying dont build the wall im simply giving those people who bash on every immigrant and idea of what is going on i pay a lot of money to keep this permit and to actually be placed on the radar so when people say build a wall they also start to screw people like me who want to succeed over thank you for reading this
oh man how do these people just say no and when asked why they have no idea its just so sad that these people get to vote have a say
wtf lol
make him stop talking
ive been thinking about this a lot for the past three years wasting trillions of dollars i consider illegal immigrants a small percentage
the second guy does not understand most of the hard working ones come here work very hard and send their money back to their home country to live like kings that hurts america not help it
someone tell trump about this kid
i cant afford and im a cheap prick so please keep making free content
ive been thinking about this for three years but i dont know id have to get some computer engineers and really smart people together to think about it and make my xray scanner system work
every time he says you speak in paragraphs he loses
build the wall with your ass bitch lmfaooo im crying
honestly lost some respect for crowder this one thing i definetly not agree with crowder considering how illegal immigrants get in and the terrain of our border on the us and mexico
better watch this now before it gets deleted
1317 why did i know steven was gonna be shady 
what this guy purposed was way scarier than anything i can think of
i agree with the first woman the wall will cost way too much
yep cheap prick canadian here lol
i swear soon i will become a mug club member as soon as you let me know when youre coming to unt
crowder where are you at i kinda wanna talk to you about these subjects because although i dont completely disagree with all of these matters i do have a slightly different lens to look at things i would love to change your mind
lets not build a wall but put a chip under their skin and tax them more y did trump not think of this
cant tax illegals and they commit a disproportionate amount of crime but sure lets turn a first world country into a third world shit holeno borders  no country
that crazy guy just makes me dislike spaniards even more
these titles keep getting better xd
wait so he wants no border control but instead an xray border which he described to be like the checkpoints at airports or when exiting a grocery store but whos to say that the imagrents would go through it
maybe just need educated people who understand how the borders are run maybe get a border agent as a guest
kys all
yea lets tax people that will never pay taxes and have no desire to
bringisth thy an xray wall let thoust protect us from thy fears shakespeare 2020lets not be blaintant we need more change my minds
that guy must watch rick and morty
i just got dumber listening to this guy wtf hes a certain kind of special isnt he lmao
how do you get them through the checkpointcreate an xray thing etcokay but how do you get them through the xray thingidk i would need to talk to some mastermindshow about a wall so they cant go around
i wish that our country wouldnt need a wall yet it is necessary today children have been coming to the border on their own and adults with children have not been able to prove they are the parents this has made the people in our country responsible for these kids at the borders that is why some of the children at the borders are alone the mexican government needs to step up yet they are in so much trouble the past few months many politicians in mexico have been murdered and the country isnt in great shape it is such a mess right now yet i believe that we are doing the best we can
how highs the wall momma 10ft high and rising
being from new mexico i can attest that this is typical new mexican politics
that guy that made new mexico look like its full of idiots
people i promise  not all new mexicans are the same definitely not voting for him  i say we build the wall 20ft taller now
i love these there are some great stories from the interviewees and steven is very compassionate yet still affirmative on his position what a swell guy
yes yes the idea of xray border sounds reduculous but we all know what he meansweve seen it in scifi plenty of times a field that you walk through that readsregisters who you are where and when you passed throughthe idea is plausible we simply dont yet have the technology for suchjust because someone cant explain their idea well doesntean its absolutely a bad ideapossibly have mexico and the us mark each citizen with a number chip or something of the like think of the movie in timethen we could have readers across the border at intervals that mark when and who passes throughany crimes they commit can be registered along with their numberis it plausible at present no not at all but as he himself said which is true technology is changing faster and faster now im not saying i agree or disagree with that idea just wanted to try to give a better wording to his ideahes a smart guy he just needs to slow down and expand his vocabulary and understanding of technologysomething every one of us could benefit from if we each did it as well
obvious pink floyd reference
just give everyone a green card have stations where people can apply for a green card background checks and such give them easily so liberals will stop whining green card holders dont qualify for any government benefits health care housing food stamps but still have to pay taxes knowing there will be no ss retirement the benefit is knowing if they have a child here that child would be a citizen
this particular individual is unscannable
that spanish fool in the white shirt and backpack is a idiot
hahahaha building a wall episode but iglesia church van as their av room
illegals dont pay taxes because they arent american citizens
that guy omg lol talking like a little child
so unfair did you expect the vlogger guy to be able to explain his plan when he was away from his group of masterminded individuals for shame steven
man the future governor of new mexico was a real special  guy  i felt myself getting dumber by the second listening to him it just seems to me that the average american is pretty fing ignorant and stupid i used to think weed was ok but i gotta go nancy reagan and say just say no to drugs my friends
mexico needs the wall just as much as the us a lot of guns go down south
that guy in the white shirt is taking some seriously good lsd hook us up bro 
man i hate when he goes to the public
xray borders for all
510 years we prolly will have flying ubers and building the wall is also bad because itll cost a lot of money to make but for every other reasons yes its a good thing to do for us
xray borders wow thats pretty hightech lol
i do not support the wall for one main reason in trumps recent tax plan he had the money being put to the wall i do not want my tax money to go to the wall since it wasnt really anyones idea until 2015 i do however support the increased security at the border
feel bad for the woman because of her neighbors
steven is talking to a nitwit
dont build a wall lay a minefield along the border
these are always a healthy reminder that the majority of humans are stupid as absolute fuck
this guy is an idiotlet them come here and tax them  wtf
the wall is expensive and pointless most illegal immigrants come here legally and dont leave after their visas expire also net immigration with mexico has been net 0 since 08
people are so clueless how much crime illegals bring into this country and how much of our us tax dollars go to taking care of them
not gay fanny pack
im sure crowder still has nightmares about yusuf
i wish you did these with people who were actually informed on the matter thats way we could have some actual dialogue lol but i mean its not your fault the common citizen isnt informed enough
the guy mustve just watched minority report
sounds like that dude wanted a police state that knows where all noncurrent citizens are within a 20 minute drive of where they were scanned
q borders becoming a thing of the pasta thats called a new world order slaverydangerous freedom is preferable to safe slavery
have leeroy back for like a segment on how his xray boarder wall theory is going
the second was a cool guy
i realize or at least i assume the young man who had the camera had a few issues either way i feel that i must shine a light on the importance of a border no borders mean no country period but this is truly what the democrats want and all for voter turnout they would sell out every american citizen nay trade out any and all american citizens just for the mexican vote politicians dont see race color or creed unless the color is green ie money and this is especially true for those on the left green the color of money and pollsratings is all that matters in fact liberals will say and do whatever they can within reality not always and all to achieve voter turnouts
thats funny because a lot of the drugs come in straight through the border and through tunnels not through the fence thats on now
new mexico is in some real trouble is this dude decides too run hahaha
the this stupid don t no pablo escobar el chapo los capos ect omg why we have retarded like this stupid and this life
leroy is generating ideas in a dimension higher than we can comprehend
wow leroy is out there electronically tagging immigrants and tracking them at all times is as antithetical to what this country stands for that it just boggles the mind that boy needs to set aside the scifi and read up on some history
lol rather than have legal immigration lets use some sort of biometric scanner to track illegal immigrants thats way more in keeping with american valuesi love that he thinks we could afford to cover all our borders with his made up future tech
this man is brilliant president trump should hire him to tackle the immigration problem
hey dumbass  go find your geniuses to come up with an idea for the free flowing yada yada yada  if those geniuses dont tell you that what you need is a wall within 5 minutes  they are not geniuses  the solution to this problem was invented way back in the bce days  way back  like 15 minutes after mankind advanced past monkeykind
a great man once said  fuck the wall  mine the border instead
i one day plan on being the governor of new mexico lmaaaaooooooo
dose this camera guy think we live in the year 2177
so that guy is essentially saying each border needs a shock fence like with dogs
the wall was built with your ass bitch
if that dude becomes the governor of new mexico i will pray for them
that mark is not a spaniard
do one a vid on veganism
also leroy scares me with his thinking no human should be branded thats some devil stuff and thats demented and twisted
the wall would be a huge expense with a small payout many immigrants come to the us through planes a wall would help with that
was the guy high
dont build a wall thatll be ridiculous the cost and it wont work we need to build a bigger surveillance state that xray monitors you everywhere you go im sure thatll be cheap and will work also im thinking about being the governor of new mexico the people there dont like all the immigrants so i want to bring in more vote for me ps im not sure of anything im saying ill need to speak to a think tank funded by soros to validate my opinionskids definitely going places
i was really trying to give the second guy the benefit of the doubt but god damn hes an idiot
leroy isnt getting into mensa anytime soon
that mark is not a spaniard
do this in socal
i believe in lower taxes change my mind
jesus leroy how dumb are you  seriously dude you are reason why people are pissed off good luck with running for governor you dopey shit
yes yes i have been waitingforchangemymind for years thnx steve your my favorite teacher ps could you do gender is not a social construct
1317 same crowder lol
we could definitely use that guy in a leadership position in government
that spanish dude is dumb as shit and a little crazy
i think his vision for tagging illegal aliens like deer with an rfid chip will go over really well with the open borders crowd
lots of things need changed thats for sure
this man is clearly on drugszuh or pharmazooticles
lmao an xray border but were not supposed to have borders
im against the wall im very far right im a independent constitutionalistfreedom fighter look if they build a wall thats against natural rights of god given rights freedom of travel doesnt mean i dont think every last person should be vetted and background checked and watched if they dont have much to give us about them for a year or two and have them on a list also if the wall is built its anti freedom for americans who want to leave freely wherever the want due to their natural rights
well at least leeroy had some good ideas
uhhh so is steven just doing this for fun to see ehat people would say or does he actually want a wall he talks about interesting topics
americans think a wall is going to magically make people stop coming here  it didnt work in china  instead of wasting that money and waiting for the wall to be built you can take actions now and enforce illegal immigration in fact help make legal immigration easier  lets not have people wait years to finally be citizens make the containment camps more harsher so they wont come back illegal ever again make it so even if illegals do have anchor babies that they wont get free entitlements
this guy has the mental capacity of a potato
lol i am dead right now
did the second person suggest that immigrants get tagged with an rdif chip    fss   the madness never ends
the majority of illegal immigrants come in legally as visitors they then proceed to overstay their welcome im confused what kind of reform could stop this besides making git impossible to visit the country
new mexico is a sanctuary city dude its a state good luck with the whole governor thing
how about micro chip surgically in panted
i liked leroys approach get them through the system and instruction get them socsec s tax them in other words have them follow the naturalization process already in place but which is ignored lol that was rich
its interesting youre a great debater  the second someone says something that actually proves a point against yours you throw it away and they actually let you just steam roll them other than that  its a shame that in all of these videos you enforce statistics but remove ethics both fact and ethical issues are just as relevant in society and allow society to thrive it would be interesting if you actually considered ethical positions as well coming from a sociological background
so you did the wall great how about i believe in border security change my mind
the drug cartels have digging tunnels down pretty well by now i dont think the wall is going to stop it theyll spend the time  money and dig under it no problem only reason its less common now is its cheaper to send them across on foot and if they get caught the drugs are cheap and the people mean nothing to the cartels if tunnels become the new cheapest way it will be what they use
i think that dude was just trolling otherwise he has something wrong in his head
i already supported building the wall but after watching thiswhere can i volunteer to help build the wall
he sounds high
my girlfriend is a legal immigrant from eastern europe the majority of legal immigrants are for border enforcement as is she to be honest it isnt fair to those whom went the proper channels paid the money to get in and took the steps to become a citizen it isnt fair to those who are waiting to get in legally why should someone who has gotten in illegally be allowed to stay while people who have come here legally cannot get their family brought in
hahaha i think he can be the ca governor he sure did sound like her lol
lol  loved that dude id have to get a few masterminds for his plan lolman these people are retarded
you would be here with gogreenglobal holy shit hahahah
you struck comedy gold with this rofl you know its sad too because this is a snapshot of the typical uninformed liberal voter thats detached from rational thinking and common sense factsfeelings
so if not a wall then whatoh i dunno some kinda like xray scanner or somethingim done i just cant anymore
i feel really  sorry for that one lady in the beginning  here she is doing things the right way being put into a state of fear by illegal immigrants in her neighborhood  but also fearful that she could never visit her relatives in mexico because she believes that she could never return if a wall is built i still believe that a wall should be built  but we have to do more to secure the nation and us citizenship as many illegal immigrants come here via overstaying their visa we need to track people like that  microchip them
the mexican guy is an idiot lets make an xray border
this guy said he is not mexican he said he is spanish  my dude you are more mexican than a taco 
1318 literally jim halpert
let me tell you this there are no negatives that come from building the wall legitimately no negatives thee only reason that people dont want the wall is because trump is in office i guarantee the first 10 words from someone who argues against the wall will say trump if hilary did this she would be praised not because she does it better or faster but because people are in so much denial and still so angry that she lost they will argue against things that will actually improve their lives and the countries
worse cmm ever no boarders thats my suggestion no wall because most illegal immigrants get here by over staying their visa and  thing called air planes exist  free and open with no checking between mexico canada and the usa  just like the provinces in canada or the boarders between  states boarders are a joke and only artificially create divisions
wtf how stupid
crowder if you fail to seize the golden opportunity of both going after therealbosshoggs aka pharmaceuticals with straight facts to cut through that murky bullshit we all hear and make for another badass remake in lwc fashion riffing off this last interview i just wont know what to sayreach me with your thoughts comments concerns questions i have thus far fulfilled all my rational and obvious moral responsibilities we good 
dear god these two are making hispanics look retarded
before open borders can occur no citizenship unless you respect the inaleenabie rights of other citizens work visas can be easier crime background much more stringent and citizenship much much more difficult voting process much more thoroughly vetted and no voting for anyone other than citizens no income tax no irs no federalie feudal reserve simplify legislation so that there are zero riders on bills the content of the bill is only one item nothing unrelated to it added on if all this occurs the globalist fuedalist leftists will then say whats the point and they prove the point that the left uses foreigners as pawns not actually caring about them but using them to enslave other people under corporateneofuedalism theres no such thing as socialism anymore btw the left now is totally behind the very thing that socialism preached against but was secretly supporting and they are no longer secretly supporting it total colonial fuedalism even though native americans are rightfully angry about colonialism
that face lol
im not necessarily against strengthening the border it does have its importance and its mindboggling to have people saying we should just have zero border laws without thinking of the consequences that would come if they werent a thing however what i dont like is trump prioritizing building this wall over instead tackling the source of the problem building this wall isnt gonna stop every immigrant from finding a way around this thing instead what we should be doing is helping to solve the issues that cause southern americans to want to flee over here to our country when those issues are solved boom its a winwin situation for both sides south america is freed of their issues and we dont have to deal with so many illegals causing issues for us
can we get a change my mind about climate change i want to see that that would be so funny
i think the rays they should use on the border is gamma rays
he wants to be mayor of new mexicothe sanctuary cityyup hes a contender
one more  i believe in the 1st amendment change my mind
we need that wall thats why we voted for trump period
that guy talking about the xray thing basically described a border checkpoint but god forbid we call a spade a spade
its upsetting to see how lost some people are in society
those last few seconds felt like a scene from the office
scientifical proof that the mentally challenged are unaware of their condition
i dont know whats scarier the fact that he might run for governor of new mexico one day or the fact that with the mindset of many on the left he might get elected
dont know whats worse the people who interviewed or the sad fact that you have to have security watching your back while you try and filmkeep up the good work guys
creditable people
just taxem  makeem pass the courses pure entertainment
its a free thought well im glad we didnt have to pay to listen to this guys grand ideas
jesus christ could you have got a worse person to sit down this white shirt guy should be on 112 change my mind
the 2nd dude is just a meme
wow that dude has some mental issues he wants to be governor lol
as soon as leroy started talking i knew he was a new mexican its something about the way he was talking why not use the same technology used on toll road passes in our id cards since ss numbers are like our own personal vin and tax code drivers licences are in a database why not mash up all that info along with a dna sample and finger prints into a series of numbers and issue that to  us citizens of course thats big brother at its finest put all those scanners at every stop sign street lamp supermarket gas station bank and public restroom youd know who shouldnt be there real quick but youd have to give up some privacy big brother at its finest just a random thought i thought was interesting
this guy is wanting technology thats 200 years in the future im dying of laughter
this 2ed guy is on meth
it sounded like that guy wanted to microchip immigrants
nothing against the guy in the white bc he seems confident with what hes saying but hes saying a lot of nonsense and halfbaked ideas idky im not more confident when i at least have some thought out ideas
okay buildng the wall is an idiotic idea if you think that it will prevent illegal immigration you would be mistaken there  is an entire cave structure of tunnels that the wall couldnt take care of for it to take care of all of these holes there would be a humongous price much higher than the already estimated price trump is naming and this money would be coming out of our own pocket because theres no reason that mexico could pay for it even if they could furthermore there is a considerable lack of border patrol which would be a much better way to approach the goal of preventing illegal immigration when we dont consider that the biggest cause of illegal immigration is really people coming on temporary visas and then not leaving a wall will not prevent these people from coming into our country where better guarding of our borders by actual people would be more affordable further increasing the guards at the border provides more longstanding jobs than the ineffectual wall would  and from what i hear the wall would be more effectual in keeping people in rather than out seeing as more people are trying to leave than enter this country we also have people who live in the united states legally that have property this wall would run through which doesnt benefit these people at all
i wouldnt be opposed to making it much easier to come here legally but then at the same time make the penalties for being here illegally strict control the border and crack down on businesses that hire illegals
you shouldve explained to her how mexico has a very large fence on the border plus explain to her how mexico treats illegals there
a ad for your video in your video i didnt even know i was watching a ad for a second
presidente trump sube la pared
827 immigration is only going to get worse wew interesting way to describe the situation lol
please make longer change my mind videos

post your references
i think hes been talking to many of those drugs

thank you thank you thank you ive been begging for this one please do a part 2
hes trying to formulate his ideas but its not working out at all for him huge respect for leroy for being respectful and for being thoughtful but he just has no idea what hes talking about whatsoever and also huge respect to crowder for not being so annoyed at him for not understanding
is that guy for real
leroy is on drugsa
how do you tax illegal immigrants where the majority probably arent in the system anyway
oh leroy 
last guy is a real professor smh
when your calling for x ray scanners id scan registrys is chips and masterminds umm buddy that right there is the  recipe for really really bad things like i cant properly express how bad that is
why would they need to become citizens if there is no border non sense
this dude just scientificul what drugs is this man on
jesus steven edit stop letting idiots ramble on and on and on and on i would have asked the beaner 405 right off do you lock your housecar if so why also how many of the earths billions should america take in make citizens and give benefits to
i am sorry crowder has to deal with this i want to eat crayons now and is there a new flavor windex
this is what we need baby the second guy was learning thats important even if they didnt agree in the end its opening the door for him to change his mind since hes not ignoring the facts
what surprised me that its only 13 minutes long need more d
when steven sets up a change my mind booth they arent sending their best
when you receive something that is put inon your right hand or forehead and you can not buy or sell unless you have it you will also receive the full wrath of god  research mark of the beast 666 for you millennials that probably havent heard much about it  this is what all the brainwashing is leading up to so that you will take the mark willingly
that lady reminds me why getting educated matters
so lojack the immigrants
its like arguing with a goldfish
ya gotta come to southern illinois university edwardsville tons of people with debate you when school starts in august enjoy the show
can you do this in college campuses cause people in the streets dont bring forth good arguments
change my mind videos are awesome
unedited conversations that ladys face was blurred i doubt it looks like that in real life seems like an edit to me got him
is the great wall of china racist is the border between north and south korea racist are all the other walled off sections of americas borders with mexico and canada racist is the fence that keeps my neighbors stupid dog from shitting in my yard racist no
this guy is ridiculous haha
that kid has no senseajust invents statisticswants electronic tracking devices put into peoplexray bordersdrugsa pastafastathisadata baseaopiatesa
where did you find the intelligent spanish dude leroy having issues getting a point across our schools have failed america
do this again these people were just talking out of their ass
where do you do these interviews
most of the border is already covered most illegal immigration comes from overstayed visas dumb ass fucks it comes from planes not fucking jumping over the big ass wall
wow you clicked baited people
whack no one was right lmao not even steven
kinda need a wall with a gate to put that xray on unless he wants xrays running along the entire length of the border
the sad part is that the guy is actually trying to figure out an alternative way to solve illegal immigration unlike the democrats who dont change anything and want everything to stay the same he is truly more productive than all of them still i did not understand his logic of thinking at all
if they go through an xray and write a report then they arent illegal and how would you even do that without a wall
leroy 
1137 oh brother
your face at the end was like a scene from the office lol
bruh make longer videos with people that can make a valid argument maybe go back to college campuses
lmao hey the next governor of new mexico was on change my mind
lmao why would they walk through the extra gate if theres no wall
well that was disappointing  i feel like crowders studying prior to this episode was wasted on the people chosen for the debate  i was looking forward to hearing his stance on the matter not listen to some guy talk out of breathe about xray electronic passports and no borders  could be that they were unable to find a decent person to debate with in an entire day of filming but this episode was a total let down
an xray border would be great but uh how
we could all get those exploding neck collarsget out of lineyour head explodes
waste of tax dollars the wall will be a hindarence itll just slow illegal border crossings down until they can find another way to get through  cartels already have and had tunnels for trafficking drugs and people across the border thinking a wall will simply put an end to it is foolish
back in 2007 the us tried to build a 700 mile fence in order to secure the border it did not work because it is illegal to build anything near a river the rio grande in this case because it may interfere with the river itself so they tried to build it in land and by doing so the government forcefully took the property of hundreds of american property owners the fence was very expensive and a failure take a look at this sourcehttpsenwikipediaorgwikisecurefenceactof2006
taxing undocumented workers lmfao
you know like
just annex mexico
my reason not to build the wall lets say we do build the wall its going to take months possibly longer just to design a wall that size not only that a wall that size will take years to build chances are one of the future presidents will abandon that wall we wasted money and time to build that wall trump claims mexico will build the wall theres many things mexico could do to stall the building of the wall and wait it out until their free of building it also convincing mexico to build the wall is highly unlikely now lets say the wall is complete theres many other ways to get into the country building the wall will only cause conflict with mexico and right now we cant afford to be on bad terms with any other countries keep in mind im not against the wall im just thinking of the reality of it
theyre breaking our laws by how they come here but forget that make them citizensyeah like that would help
amazing how this guy is so comfortable with the idea of the government tagging and tracking you with microchips presumably surgically inserted into your body but the idea of a concrete wall preventing illegal entry is just too much to handle im pretty sure the average iq of most of the change my mind participants is comparable with the temperature of the luke warm coffee basking in your mug club cup
congrats on 2 million subs
that dude is an absolute idiot
xray borders brilliant
im not sure what subscribed means anymore either but i know what a freeloading cheap prick is and i know how to unsubscribe fuck you asshole
i was just telling my husband about these change my mind segments i was complaining you need to do another one then bam here it is lol too short though 
this dude is spun out of his fucking mind hes high did you not realize this
please make another onemaybe with some more intelligent people if possible
sounds like hes getting at something along the lines of a microchip or maybehmmmm the mark of the beast   a universal mark or barcode that allows you to be scanned tracked  and move about the world or maybe its just an xray machine what do i know
im from new mexico and yea that guy was pretty off
fucking xray boarders   what the fuck are xray boarders
im not sure what subscribed means anymore either but i know what a freeloading cheap prick is and i know how to unsubscribe fuck you asshole
is this game of thrones idiots just punish people who hire illegal workers wall wont work
that ending killed me 
xray borders 
societys have always built castle walls borders countries  to keep people safe 
im not mexican im spanish what am i missing something like is there a difference 
where can i find the citations for many of the statistics you bring up especially about the crime rates from illegal immigrants i believe you but it would be useful to have the citations to use for references in my own arguments
holy shit dude your face matched mine wtf xray wall llolololool
new mexico is fucked worse than california californa valley at least has a very high number of libertarians
im so tired of hearing about the woes of illegal alien im also tired of people falsely referring them as some kind of immigrant i want a better life where can i run to where ill be taken care of as good as they are illegal aliens have destroyed our country
invaders
you cant change the mind of entitled racist crackkkers its impossible
all illegals are criminals by virtue of entering the countrywait for itillegally
very idiotic people you interviewed this time around
lol the problem is a person who enters this country illegal can not become a citizen that would be like going to disney and cutting in front of other people also those who have been cause more than once are automatically deported again funny how some people have forgotten kate steinle already
wtmf was that guy talking about he sounded like a buffoon seriously leroy
she came here legally and she doesnt want her rights taken away by those that would abuse the rights we most at least take for granted  she doesnt take them for granted  she just doesnt want a wall  fair enough
people seem to be very appalled at the immigration laws of america saying why are you ripping children from parents arms my question is the report issued annually by the administration for children and families of the department of health and human services shows that 437500 children were in foster care by the end of fiscal year 2016 a year earlier the number was 427400 what regulations policies and marches are happening for these children and what is the defining factor of children that are considered being treated poorly half a million kids in care almost just in foster care i dont believe thats counting group homes as well what are we doing as a people and as a community to not only prevent these numbers from increasing and what are we doing to help the children themselves is it safe to assume that there currently isnt enough resources to support children in canada and america if these numbers are growing at high rates wouldnt having state and provincial child welfare laws mean geographical location defines that childs resources and when do people start rallying behind indigenous issues currently in canada and america love what you do steven thank you for being the voice we need
this is the first one ive seen notgayjared in
i think borders will be a thing of the past in the next 5 10 yearswhat fucking planet is this guy living on
this latino man thinks we are living in 3018 i cant believe how stupid he is but then again he does sound like your typical progressive
i got an ad for crtv with stevens last episode of change my mind in it for this episode of change my mind
the ignorance of the comments here are astoundingillegal say it with me illegaldont want to protect our country leaveand dont you dare call law enforcement to help you when you dont want the laws enforced
leory is 100 high on crack
thats the problem naive non thinking normal people dont think like criminals and theres some baaaaaad people in this world  these guests  cant even think right and could never protect a country
that pogo intro music so good check out his channel if you havent heard of him
0 intelligent thought
leroy is pretty chill
these people are retarded
this video has shown me a new level of stupidity i did not think could be achieved
i feel dumber having watched this
so the guy he talked to second is basically an advocate for giving up its too hard to defend the borders so lets forget it were not winning the drug war so why bother trying using that logic sometimes you have a bad day whats the point in pushing through it why not just blow your head off instead of trying again tomorrow i dont get that way of thinking
that spanish guy is talking some biblical stuff man  borderless nations rfid chipping combined with all the virtue signalars and sjw thought police everywhere it reminds me of minority report
its unfortunate to see these two people ostensibly agree with crowdermigrate legally pay taxes work dont contribute to the drug problembut theyve been conditioned to think racism when the word wall comes up
i dont agree with you but i still subscribed because i enjoyed the way you expressed your opinion
i got a steven crowder ad on this video
good luck new mexico
if im wrong please let me knowmy father is an immigrant from spain came to this country not speaking a word of english he worked very hard to get a green card learn the language and studied hard to learn his tradehis views on immigration are very conservative he says come legally and there wont be an issuenow on the other hand my sister is marrying an english man they both live in barcelona spainthey have been working for around 12 years to get her fianc to the us legally spent time and a lot of money they dont have to make this work its very difficult the fact that people think its racism its only mexican citizens is not true in any sense becoming a legal citizen of the us is hard for any immigrant  be you a white man from england a fisherman from japan or anything in betweenin my humble opinion the laws should maybe be fixed up to make it easier for people to come legally the process is hard  and desperate families will do anything to give their children better lives legally or notso maybe change the way we handle immigration so its not so difficult to come legallyif im wrong please let me know
get your hard hat ready 
shoutout to those who sit down and have civil discourse despite different opinions
i just wanna make sure that i get this clear the future governor of new mexico wants electronic id tags that track where the holder goes even in the city
does that first woman know you dont need a coke bottle to grow coke
xray wall poggers lol
how about i change your mind through a written text i think i can
holy shit someone just needs to mention how counterproductive building and maintaining the wall would be and how its just a spectacle of security and not actually preventing illegal immigration at all
governor of new mexico yeah right
boss hog def  wealthy old white men whose sole aim in life is to oppress and enslave everyonesentence those boss hogs be oppressing me
crowder blur the face on the first womans id lanyard you blur her face but not her identification with her face

that guy was high
on behalf of all new mexicans i wholeheartedly disavow this leroy trujillo fellow

1027 were all living in 2018 while this guy living in 3018
crowder i was a hippy liberal for so longthought you were a douche at firstuntil one of my idols rogan got a little too defensive about one of my favorite plants and was a little douchey to  you and i was like damncrowder is actually being rational on this onelove the change my mind series manthat being saidi think the wall is stupid havent watched this yetbut will peace and intellectual honesty for all alsohave you ever seen a shegator protect her young
build the wall designated marksmen every ten miles or so randomly distributed will take care of the leakers detain the immigrants  execute the coyotes the ones guiding the illegals
that poor fuckin lady
so brave of you to have this conversation in your underwear
that lady has to have a mental illness she makes less sense than democrats
i support legal immigration but i dont like the wall  superior logic right there
the dude gets an a for effort
1 physically impossible in the span of his term2 theyre just going to use another way3 do you honestly think one of the most renowned businessmen in the world would cut ties with arguably one of your biggest trading partnersthat being said these are more directed at why you wont rather than why you shouldnt
this guy making the raza look bad
keep em coming
leroya is high as a kitea talking like thisa
this was rough i could barely finish it
the difference is that americans who are buying the drugs are our problem the people bringing the drugs in are not our problem
just seems like it would cost too much that is if its literally a big huge wall all across the southern boarder
this is gonna be fun 
i feel like these change my minds have been dumbed down since the meme
that lady is against building the wall because shed rather just fucking nuke mexico lol
this dude made people in new mexico look like fucking idiots
what the fuck was that blur his face his kids might see this one day
822 omg this guy is a moron
when you live in the land where the government forces id chips into your children
this dude is coked up has no real idea
i agree on a lot of things but i honestly dont think the wall would do anything just because of the realistic principles on how politics plays a role in drug distribution both legal and illegal the war on drugs is the reason for poor borders honestly its all a sham our own country has lied to us and it seems a lot of things are coming forward since trump so hopefully this and more of the truth comes out
jesus is god  change my mind
the guy has a good point about the pharmaceutical industry being the worst of the drug problem lol
for that ladys safety you shouldve done some voice editing too see i get her point why shes not in favor of the wall to the fukced up shit that is already inside our country its not keeping them out but what needs to be conveyed is that the wall can potential limit how much of the rotten people can get in so that we can then focus on getting the ones still in this country out its just like if your house is flooding from water on the outside well before you try scooping water out you need to limit if not block the water thats still getting in first otherwise youll never get the job done
does anyone notice how you blurred her face but not her id tag with her name and face
honestly the whole wall thing seems like a big waste of money not even considering it as deterent to migrant crossings it just sounds like we could build more infrastructure where it actually matters
trump 2024 change my mind
steven i lost brain cells watching leroy
so the answer has been found its like an xray border ya know man brilliant i feel as if a wall has fallen on me
do you think location might have contributed to the drive bys lol
just got a louder with crowder ad on a louder with crowder vidnice
i lost precious brain cells watching that dude xray border  yeah okay 
bro the stupidity on simpleminded thought processes fucking triggers the fuck outta me
so what do you do when you want to opt out of the xray border the idontwannagothroughtheait
i hate it when mexicans say they are not mexican that they are spanish
i just entered a country illegally let me register myself down as a taxpayer even though i have no money to pay said taxes

was just watching game of thrones paused it for this
letting people come in does not stop the problem why they leave in the first place no one should have to pay for other peoples problems either
1317  when you heard the most unethical  way to deal with illegal immigrants
if most of the illegal immigrants that enter this country fly in on temporary visas and just stay past the time to go back the wall is just a very expensive way of preventing a small portion of those who enter this country illegally
the only people who get mad when you set boundaries are those who benefited from you not having any
lady and gentlemen new mexicos future governor
dont forget to make mexico pay for it
this guy is coked out of his head
thats dirty airing what she said when she leaned in to whisper dude you could get her hurt
i want the drugs that guy was on
honestly that first interview was just sad
if you blurred her face you should probably blur the id card hanging from her neck too
i lost brain cells watching this one
leeroy is an idiot
build that fucking wall asap
do people realize you do in fact need a wallfence or some separation line that marks where one country ends and another starts different places develop different laws  regulations you need a marker to show where different rules start and end also you may need to have barriers to keep criminals from other places from taking advantage of your territory this is very logical and should be selfevident
at least the guy is looking for a solution instead of being offended geez
i worked with a dreamer had a work permit drivers license car insurance speeding tickets wasnt deported
oh dear this is an argument for a better education
bunch of knuckleheads that felt like voicing their opinions on this one more so than usual i think a dont build the wall change my mind would have been more interesting even many trump supporters arent for the wall and it would be interesting to hear some super conservatives defend their position
steven you should have held that look at the end for at least 30 seconds and played twiight zone in background what the what 
freaking love the change my mind segments
what if i told you we already have one lol borders shouldnt be a thing bro try walking into any other country in the world we arent racist for wanting secure borders its a national security policy that every nation has
ugh
maybe we can get space force to build this xray wall for their first project
omg i lost some iq points listening to that dude and im from nm too our states education system at its finest
steven is wearing vans
i hope that women is alright she seemed really concerned with her safety
going for broke homeboy is an idiot
dude is advocating for chipping people like dogs jesus
that second guyhe made my brain hurt he wants to put xray gates all along the border yes lets give the immigrants and residents within the area cancer yes slow clap yes
how about we do special taxes where any dolt in america that wants to pay for a stupid symbolic wall can pay for it if they so choose and the rest of the population can laugh and keep their money
forget governor this guy should go for general of the space force
um are you guys done with the unedited interviewsif so you should stop saying thats what youre doing
104k likes in 3 hours still not treanding smh
i hate that these people lack vocabulary they probably could argue their point but most of them cant bc not vocabulary it was very hard to watch this
1058 just make it gamma ray and be done with it
how do illegal aliens pay taxes my township spends 24k per student per year you cant convince me their parents are providing 24k of economic benefit to the township each year
theres only one argument against the wall that i find compelling which is that a border wall could be used by an oppressive us government to prevent its citizens from venturing outside of the country without permission
i dont want to have illegal immigrants in our border as well but am i the only one who thinks this wall wont keep them out some of those illegals lifes are in jeopardy unless they cross the border so i dont think a wall will stop them
i feel like this video is just make liberals hear there arguments out loud so they know that they just sound straight up retarded  he should how ever post a actual intellectual debate cause ive been in many debates as well and would like to hear what he has to say about it
ill admit that an actual wall is a bit extreme but its only after decades of more reasonable solutions being undermined and shot down at every level by various special interests that it has come to this
421 lol
i like what the guy said he sounds like trump but without the hate
hey look its the new xray bordercool theres no wall lets go around it
suggestion i am for due process change my mind
the ppl interviewed are very low iq no substantive debate just mindless drivel im sorry but this video gets a grade of d
that guy was living in a fantasy land
the dude with the camera is fucking dumb he wants to tag peolpewtf hahah steven shouldve just walked away
steven crowder  we should pay for our own wall change my mind
leroy was just brainstorming on the spot his mind changed like 9 times
oh god  this is unbearable
wow steven you just were on the beaugreen global show thats like my favourite show of all time leroy sent me here  lolz wtf
as an ex opiate addict of 10 years i consider myself an expert yes i got hooked on pills when the government cracked down on prescriptions i went to heroin most of my dealers were mexican most of the drugs i did was mexican black tar if there had been no mexican black tar itd have been much harder to find and id have potentially had to get clean then blame it on junkies all you want but if theres no product theres no junkies is it too much to ask these people to use logic
oh my word this dude was hilariously stupid
that look  1316 lmao 
why does she have a plant in a water bottle
that was fuckin painful to watch wtf
i like this guy im all for the laserxrayborders build a laser wall
x ray border
the xray border 
dont build the wall instead violate peoples privacy instead by tagging them with xrays and this guy wants to be a governor no wonder there arent many mexican scientist they are all idiots
i bet his friends never argue with him
have you heard austin petersens argument for immigration reform i personally believe it is a more welfare issue than uncontrolled immigration
i got an ad for the only two genders change my mind and got so confused still a great video
just dont give them any hand outsno free lunch hereso it wont matter then cuz without money and no job they will quit coming
this dude is on something
ill have whatever drug that guy was on please
trump wants a wall bernie wants things free if they worked together they could build a wall for free
this guy in white shirt sounds stoned or brainless
another excellent post  these change my mind shows are excellent  raw and honest 
1040 this guys an absolute idiot he makes no sense stop them coming in and digitally scan them without walls whats he want a line of friendly security guards standing along the boarder  fuck my life
my head hurts  the lady wants to play narc the guy in the white t sits down like he has his facts and argument ready just plain ohhh confusion here i think there is a bar near
420 dislikes
props on the guy with the dfa shirt
we have a huge population anyways we dont need more people as well as their money  america has enough problems with out adding even more people yes america was born on immigrants in the beginning its not how america should be forever
he was talking from his azz
you hit two million subs
you have to find smarter people than this or these segments are pointless
friscal conservatives thinking multiple ongoing wars  border walls are economically viable yet healthcare isnt
first lady had a pet plantthats so cool
that last guy i lost so many brain cells listening to himmah
this dude doesnt want a border wall but is okay with placing an electronic device on every person in the country so they can be scanned through a data base one would argue thats a much more extreme measure sir
basically he prefers a digital wall
as a conservative the wall is a waste of time since they can fly over the wall or just take a boat but border security is important
xray borders give them all cancer 
im having a hard time believing the guy wasnt high as fuck lol
if these people are representative of the sort of immigrants were getting were in real trouble i know the second person said his family has been here since the 1500s but his accent tells a different story
borders are a thing of the past yeah ok
xray border lol are we going to put a chip in every mexican so they can be xrayed
i was really interested in learning what the left wanted to do with border control and it sounds like they dont have a clue
now that is profound naivety
tards cant understand their own retardation
that was a waste got some real bright stars there that guy was worthless 2 sentences in but i still managed to give him the benefit and listened for another 5 min nope could have stop and been good with myself
so he wants a border but not a border so confused
3
does that disproportionate stat about murder include the illegal immigrants who mass murder through terrorism i imagine that alone would make the disproportionate crimes weigh in their favor meaning its not illegals in general but specifically terrorists i personally dont care about walls i dont think they will do harm or good in the long run in the future all walls will be torn down as value convergence is approached until then im just curious how many of the murders in this stat were in mass murder events by a few
that dude was lit
come to this country legally like me
forgot to blur that womans id badge
for everyone saying the wall is a waste of money just use technology to monitor crossings we need way more border and ice agents to enforce your idea so if you want to increase bpaice numbers ten fold then im in favor of it personally id like the wall and the extra agents but ill take one good barriers also tend to create funnels and choke points making it easier to catch people even if they dont outright stop crossings
id love to see you revisit this topic once school starts so you can go on campus and get more conversations
the mexicanindian who thinks he is spanish is scary as hell if he is representative of what the future holds an xray wall that records a chip id these sort of deranged ones are the first to go when the  great purge  begins
that guy was a moron seriously i dont think he has a clue what illegal even stands for
what drugza is he on
damn making a difference i hope you helped that woman report those people causing her to live in fear
how the hell does he get that illegal immigrants commit 37 of homicide
this guy doesnt think before he talks hes just word vomiting things hes heard if he actually sat down and thought about what he was saying hed realize how stupid it sounds
the name should be crowder brainwashes stupid people
after three years of planning and a lots of mexican pot the rfid reading xray border wall is nearly completeisnt that still a wall thoughnobody asked for your logic
the homicide conviction rate for nativeborn americans was 388 per 100000 29 per 100000 for illegal immigrants and 051 per 100000 for legal immigrants cato institute  criminal immigrants in texas illegal immigrant conviction and arrest rates for homicide sexual assault larceny and other crimes remind me where youre getting these statistics steven and honesty ask yourself if thats the most accurate data available
omg  the look on crowders face at the end is priceless
hes talking about the mark of the beast man an xray machine that scans your id he wants to do this with really fast technology  hes talking about a world without borders whats the id that will be so easy to scan maybe a chip implanted in your right hand or forehead if it can recognize you so quick hes talking about quantum ai technology hardwired into a biometric database that will instantaneously recognize you please read revelations that is exactly what hes talking about
not gay jarreeeeed hi
can you please invite yousef from the socialism is evil cmmi know he was very insulting but im tired of yt videos trying to say you bullied himwould you be interest in that
his latino  card has been revoked
641 not gay gerard is providing that hawkeye alpha dog security in the back with his watch checks 180 head turn checks and perimeter walks
do a rape culture change my mind this whole rape culture bullshit is so damaging to actual rape crimes
just tax 10 of all the money that gets sent to mexico and south america  an that will more then  pay for the wall and might even keep people that are illegally in the us out
i think we can all agree that that guy was dumb as hell but can anyone here agree with me that it is just as crazy when some trump supporters believe california allows illegal immigrants to vote and that it was in the millions
i dont think it applies here in the youtube comments but i want to change your mind simply put its too expensive i know thats a point thats been made before but if you want to secure the border for the foreseeable future im not sure just a wall will fix it walls yes worked in the past for hundreds and thousands of years but we exist in an age where transport is getting cheaper and easier we have small inexpensive efficient planes and boats openly available to anyone and theres hundreds of caribbean islands to smuggle drugs through that aspect of easy transport is only going to make the wall less and less useful as the years go by in 1020 years the wall may be completely and utterly useless people like to use the wall of israel as an example for the walls work argument israel isnt america we have 350million citizens and thousands upon thousands of miles of border to secure so saying it worked there itll work here isnt really valid im not saying the wall wont help stop illegal immigration because it would but you have to think is the amount its going to help  going to be enough in the long run to payoff its massive massive budget needed
if we cant have a wall on the border  id like for all these hypocrites to take down their fences and their walls 
remember everyone this is not about race its about behavior   we are all humans and must follow the lawif you want to blame someone for illegal aliens coming to americablame the mexican governmentthey would have you believe that illegal immigrants only break one law coming to america but thats far from the truth here are just some of the law illegal immigrants break to be in the us illegally 1 entering without legal permission 2 working illegally and getting paid cash not paying taxes 3 driving without a valid drivers license 4 driving without insurance 5 stealing someones identity to get a better job this is a felony6 manufacturing a fake identity to get a better job another felony 7 receiving any state benefits with fake or stolen id another felony 8 receiving any federal benefits with fake or stolen id another felony note  the truth about illegal aliens committing crimes in america  the new study just came out proving what we all knew in the first place  whats that  that illegal aliens committ 2 12 more crimes than a us citizens  so the next time someone tries to spew their lies about illegals aliens and crime   stats came out february 21 2018these are statistic from the noncitizens federal crimes noncitizens federal crimes statsremember everyone this is not about race its about behavior   we are all humans and must follow the lawif you want to blame someone for illegal aliens coming to americablame the mexican governmentso the next time someone tries to spew their lies about illegals aliens and crime   stats came out february 21 2018these are statistic from the noncitizens federal crimes noncitizens federal crimes stats22 of all murders 18 of all fraud33 of money laundering29 of drug trafficking72 of drug possessionareas where noncitizens account for a much larger share of convictions than their 84 percent share of the adult population include 424 percent of kidnapping convictions  315 percent of drug convictions  229 percent of money laundering convictions  134 percent of administration of justice offenses eg witness tampering obstruction and contempt  178 percent of economic crimes eg larceny embezzlement and fraud  13 percent of other convictions eg bribery civil rights environmental and prison offenses and  128 percent of auto thefts62 of illegal aliens house hold have someone on welfareso now we know the truth  not like we didnt know this already  but now we have it in writing from the top source in crimethey also do the following that hurts the us illegals have killed hundreds of innocent americans when they drunk drive illegals have murdered raped robbed and beaten tens of thousands of innocent americans bring in various diseases since mexicos health care is horrible for the average citizens driving down wages for american who have been working for years to increase their wages using schools they didnt pay into the system for ie taxes hindering american kids education since most dont speak english using all the various public services again didnt pay taxes to support the hundreds of thousands of crimes illegals have committed the cost of supporting them in prison when caught committing crimes the unwillingness of taking responsibility for their actions ie breaking our laws then trying to give some sort of excuse to justify it its wrong it hurts american much more than helps the only people failing the mexican people are failing mexican people how about fixing your own country and stop hurting mine here is an option to fix mexico the mexican people need to apply to the un for help they can dispense nato forces to join with the mexican military to wipe out the mexican cartels until mexico does that they will not have control of their country mexico is a beautiful country that is run corruptly mexico has the resources ie minerals land for agricultural hard working people beautiful warm beaches tourism etc therefore all the ingredients are there for a very successful 1st world nation now they just need the will to enforce law and order from the top down again until they get that will mexico will remain a 3rd world corrupt country those are the cold hard facts now get the will and take back your countryobviously this is addressed mainly at mexico and their pathetic treatment of their own people but it applies to most of the south american states  its amazing to me how these latins call us racist for wanting our laws enforced  yet they treat their own people like trash  what a bunch of hypocrites  shameful  where is their pride in their own people  where is the integrity to follow the law  where is the character to treat their own people with respect
blame mexico blame mexico blame mexico blame mexico blame mexico blame mexico blame mexico blame mexico blame mexico blame mexico blame mexico blame mexico blame mexico blame mexico lets not forget people   the only people separating families are the parents that brought them into this country illegally in the first place  the parents know darn well they are breaking the law   if they really loved their children they wouldnt bring them on their crime spree   breaking into america illegally is just the 1st crime they will commit several others just to surviveagain not one person mentions this is mexicos fault  why isnt the mexican gov taking care of their own people   blame mexico for not helping their own people  mexico is disgusting for not helping their own people where is the outrage and efforts to pressure mexico to help their own people  blame mexico blame mexico blame mexico blame mexico blame mexico blame mexico blame mexico blame mexico blame mexico blame mexico blame mexico blame mexico blame mexico blame mexico blame mexico blame mexico
oh brother  why let this kid go on and on like that and never mention this is about a nations sovereignty  the kid is obviously one of those open borders europass types talking about how he is spanish from new mexico since the 1500s  what a joke  the mexicans hate the spanish  it is not about drugs  boy o boy
sorry but something like this being built even in 2018 with our technological advancements would be the single largest effort of architecture in the history of mankind it would cost billions and during its production mexicans would swarm the border and vandalization would happen everywhere not to mention what it would do to the environment longterm illegal immigration is wrong and annoying but a wall isnt the way to stop it theyre all able to find work one way or another when they cross the border in the south you need to pinchincrease regulation of work for american citizens and starve them financially with that being said theirs so many of them even doing this wouldnt be enough anymore to stop them you should have done something like that 3040 years ago
these people are fucking so stupid it literally makes my head hurt
that guy lol
interesting anecdote i have a buddy at work older guy hes a mexican citizen not sure about his us status but be regularly travels to mexico and votes in mexican elections so he either has a green card or duel citizenship i talk to him often about politics in mexico who better he says the country is a living hell if you dont play ball with the cartels as a politician youre essentially dead and no matter who wins the mexican elections the people lose because the government assures the people remain poor mexico has an elite class and plenty of money and resources we have to keep the near civil war conditions in mexico in mexico mexican citizens understand this if youre really interested in helping the people of mexico petition our government to arm the mexican people theyre ready to fight for their country the best way to help the mexican people is to help them help themselves the situation is complicated but the people are fed up
sweden tells women not to go out at night after letting in illegals because they might get raped every american was outraged when 911 trade towers fell and the statistics wake up america im not hateful and i have compassion for those who need to come to america but i want them to fill out the paperwork and be contributing to our economy
borders are necessary but the wall just makes us look like commies and its going to cost the taxpayer a lot more to build that wall than to have the illegals who cross successfully into our borders living in our country im still of the milton friedman mindset that illegal immigrants help our economy i live in a border town filled with food trucks and stands operated by illegals who are otherwise entrepreneurs they offer great food at lower costs which helps inflation on the effectiveness of a wall smugglers and drug cartels will be very effective in causing breaches in these walls and will continue their welldocumented bribery of border patrol officers in return for safe passage of the people they smuggle the drug cartels are notorious for already having infiltrated our municipal governments weve had many cases of border patrol officers and city police departments here in south texas that were bribed or even blackmailed into letting smugglers through the border it wont end with trumps wall how do we know this a wall has been tried bush built a wall during his tenure as potus and that was a major failure all it did was facilitate a land grab from local farmers in the area
i thought crowder was an open borders guy
i find it funny some in the comments are surprised most day to day liberals are just mindless followers and have really no knowledge of debate
i hate the latino entitlement mentality in the usa its embarrassing how and why do american citizens accept this i am a latino immigrant to australia and we all applied to come here no latino in australia has a entitlement mentality in australia our problems come from the illegal muslim immigrants and refugees and yes you guessed it they have the entitlement mentality build the wall usa
well this one wasinteresting
that guy needs to lay off the drugs and read some books
wow  1984 is what hes asking for 
alright bring in the masterminds
2nd dude says to explain his citizenship hes descended from 16th century spanish conquistadors that settled in new mexico  did i hear that right  that sounds pretty concocted to me  check his documents
you cant just make a xray border thats not how it works
trump is a good president change my mind
it might be a cheaper idea to just build more infrared and motion detector towers on the boarder and use unmanned drones to monitor the boarder for movement and heat signatures it wouldnt stop illegals from crossing but it would allow boarder control a way to respond
this guy is such a fucking moron
what a kook
build the wallim all for legal immigration  not illegal immigration  but the left wants people to think the republicans and anyone one on the right is against all immigration not true
it would be great if you did a portion on drug addiction i want to know your standpoint on whether its a choice or a supposed disorder
i just see the wall as an odd way to stop immigration
that dude must have been really high dont do drugs kids
it will cost too much is what i hear the most but the amount of people for the wall would gladly donate extra taxes to it
sigh
i am against the wall because the border isnt the main entry point of illegal immigration we build this wall and it will also be too much money the us is already in debt so we will be in debt and the illegal immigrants will be coming in through air and sea further more illegal immigrants consist of more than just mexicans there are illegal immigrants from countries around the world why are we concentrating on just the mexicans
most illegal immigrants are just coming for work we should just more offer temporary work visas so they arent here illegally and then they can return to mexico when out of workfinished with the job for the year
that guy is never going to be the governor of new mexico
yup just give illegals more shit
best argument yet i wish someone would have told him to stop
new mexico is a sanctuary city
leroy definitely has amerindian in him most likely mexican
the spanish guy was hilarious 
im glad you didnt really engaged the last guy  there is no saving that guy
the guy has an undeveloped idea it does make sense but it needs more research i think that we should have a boarder and maybe we could have something like he said with an xray type thing but only at select points on the boarder that we already have and they are given whatever documents the need to be considered a citizen and then they could cross and i really havent thought too much about thins but if they were to commit a serious crime then they either need to pay for it or go to court like normal but if they are guilty or cant pay then maybe then they would get deported and then if they try to come back again the have a permanent mark and at a certain number of marks they would not be allowed in the country and maybe the mark has a certain lifetime aswell so that the person would never be not able to live in the us peacefully again this is an undeveloped idea but i just want to put it out there
i think he was referring to some sort of motion detector idea was highly flawed either way scientifical lmao
those thunder thighs kept me distracted  the whole video
could you do a dont impeach trump  change my mind
i think the real question is why are illegals getting support from the us if they didnt receive any form of support than you would see less illegals coming across the border and save the taxpayers money right
statistics at 630 are wrong best studies ive seen are from the cato institute article title criminal immigrants in texas illegal immigrant conviction and arrest rates for homicide sexual assault larceny and other crimes 
wtf the sad thing is that this guy probably has followers hes fucking shot
facts trump opinions
xray wall with electronically tagged humans sounds like the perfect solution so everyone can be free
build the wall with your assso is that body shaming or are they talking about shitting a brick
he did not say mexicans are criminals he said mexico is allowing their criminals to go totally different
never mind the wall they need sniper towns the country going to fall like greece they can get over a wall but you cant out run a sniper mexico needs to stop being a shit hole and fix it self why not flood guatemala or belize
at least hes trying to come up with scenarios to help lol
lol the intro your reaction is so funny
i love change my mind more more more
all thats required to be an antitrump supporter is to have an iq of a fucking mosquito
please do one on white privilege
didnt liked this video  it would had been more interesting to do im against the wall   change my mindmy response steven to why im against the wall is the video the wall from john oliver last week tonight please watchkeep uploading this videos i really like them
not on 100 on topic but can we first talk about why people are immigrating illegally now im not saying everyone who illegally enters america has good intent obviously there are bad apples in the group but theres a reason why people come to the us illegally and risk being jailed and deported  its because those countries have one of the highest crime rates in the world in 2016 latin america had 41 cities in the top 50 of the most dangerous cities in the world according to the united nations office on drugs and crime honduras home to about 825 million people has by far the highest homicide rate of all countries in the world its unparalleled average rate of 904 murders per 100000 people means that in this country almost every 1000th person is killed thats insanewith the corrupt government police force to the drug cartels of mexico to the worlds most dangerous gang ms13 to extreme poverty  its obvious latin america needs help put it this way to those against illegal immigrants and to just give a different perspective to yall just maybe if their home wasnt so horrible to live in people wouldnt need to escape and seek a better life in the us maybe that would really bring the illegal immigration rate down from latin america
there has never been a civilization that survived massive welfare and open borders  once you lose your border you lose your country
im pretty sure she said lending not laundering i think she did start to say laundering but corrected herself multiple times i wish you did a better job of protecting her identity the left is now being brainwashed into accepting rfid the gay guy in the blue and red cap just standing there
heres an idea build the wall but in the mean time get surveillance cameras all pointing at the border from california fo florida and have a channel that streams live feeds from those locations so people that dont want a wall may have a second thought
guy at 620 asks what percentage of illegal immigrants commit crimes answer all of them as being here illegally is technically a crime
some people are so dumb
lets all just stop and take a moment of silence for the brain cells we all lost listening to that guy
good god these people can vote what should change is people need to be able to pass a small test proving they understand some of these topics to be able to vote lol
a tracker like for dogs is this guy arguing with crowder this dumb
ooof this is crimgby
the first guy is fun 
conservative build the wall liberal dont build the wallleeroy  xray wall
that guy wanted a world wide big brother with computer chip surveillance and all what a brilliant 
earth style mud wall
that mexican american women is amazing
why the hell would we spend money on an expensive useless wall that people will find ways to get around when we could just give incentives for people to come here legally like getting rid of the absurd citizenship testing that most natural born americans cant pass a wall is one of the dumbest ideas ive heard from this administration that will just put more of my money towards dumb shit that wont work
i get building a wall i do think making mexico pay for it is a joke im for immigration policy theres no reason for people to come in illegally especially when they come over to be criminals not saying all are criminals coming over to be criminals its stupid i dont get 
x ray border 
she didnt say money laundering she said lending they are lending to working illegals and holding their feet to the fire for interest and shit threatening them and shiti know am illegal who got a couple rub and tugs then had some pimp pressing him to keep up the business or pay the pricefucking jokes
this guy is an idiot how do these people have a number to scan x ray border  besides how asinine it is lets just say you could or would even want to afford that how do these people have numbers xrays are just that xrays bones period no tag or distinguishable difference between people who come through  ps hes gotta be on adderall or something dude was spastic lol maga  stupid masses
omg this was fucking painful to watch
ok this one sucked some lady that wants to deport her neighbors because she thinks they are loan sharks and some junkie that was trying to sound smart not much mind changing is gonna happen right
great video steven but i gotta ask why u in your boxers haha
xrays across the entire border im sure thats healthy and not a gigantic lethal public hazard s
want a quick solution to slowing down illegal immigration repeal the 14th amendment that will require expecting parents to prove legal residency or citizenship or the child born is not a citizen this will stop anchor babies and put us in line with our european and asian allies it will remove a reward for just making it here and popping out babiesonce that happens you then put out a limited time amnesty program with a path to citizenship that would give them a tax id number and a case workerprobation officer to track them for 3 to 5 years any jail worthy offenses will lead to deportation but if they keep their nose clean and take english classes then theyre given a citizenship test and will be granted citizenship in the end failure to comply is met with deportation if caught next problem to discuss
building the wall is stupid though you can dislike illegal immigration but the wall will be ineffective expensive and useless
okay im definitely unsubscribing from your channel i agree with 98 of your opinions and i recommended your channel to friends and family because i saw you as a visionary but this is just plain stupid im sorry i should just keep my mouth shut and move on but you are only doing this for likes and subscriptions before you used to respect yourself and you were so admittedly against gays and this new community taking over our country i was sure to follow you straight through the gates of hell if i had to but you no longer have respect for yourself i know youtube is your way of income but i am american yes of course i agree with stricter enforcement put laser beams machine guns guard dogs everything to stop illegal immigration but when you agree with building the wall then your inner racist comes out karma for you is your children they will see your views of life and thats a win for me
this was painful to watch
should have went to san antonio
fucking idiot he talks before he thinks just stop border agents dont work in radiology bitch
the young  sesquipedalian unpretentiously wants to usufruct immigrants saxicolous citizenry is quickly becoming auspicious his cynosure contretemps is based on cupidity i found his circumlocution comparatively gasconading
was that guy on drugs
leroy essentially created the idea of a legal immigration system why hasnt anyone else come up with this yet
a fine example of how drugs can help write scifi movie scripts this is why we need an application to breed
i like and follow your channel crowder but this is a point of view that i cannot support still pretty interesting video
mark of the beast with some gps tracking perfect you go first buddy
lol the first guy hasnt thought this thru
mariage is for couples formed with a man and a woman only change my mind
that lady has some mental disability sad you prey on her for content
this is why i hate being latino stupid ass white people always gotta assume were oppressed and shit seriously fuck liberals 
i liked the ending of the video very the office like steve looking in to the camera
without a wall wont they just walk around the scanner why would you go through it if there is no wall especially if you have a duffel bag full of heroin are you going to go through the scanner or walk around because theres no wall
borders are redrawn and that spanish man stops being mestizothat foo definitely has some indigenous dna
poor lady i hope things turn out allright for her
that guy had absolutely no idea what he is talking about 
no wall what we need is a gate with xray that identifies people how would you get them to go through the gate well youd make them go through it like  with a wall  some people are so stupid  they link wall to bad and dont think about why its needed
the second guy gave me a brain tumor
that mexican guy was on meth big time
this ass in the white shirt is all over place like a car thats lost its tire
that kid is an absolute idiot
i want a wall up on the northern border to stop all the american refugees from coming into canada illegally
bahahahaha  xrays  bahahahhahhah
it would be cheaper and more effective to build the wall and increase border security than do what the 2nd guy proposed
yecan we have a redo on this this was not constructive at all i understand that nobody sat down but we need people with real arguments haha
u shouldnt have  posted this video crowderyou put that womens life in dangeri can see her body shapevoice and the location of this videoif i knew her i could easily recognize her
homeboy is against a wall but is for microchipping people and making them have a written note on top wow
its so wwwwwwowwwwyyyyyyy in nk
that electronic keep pass will also be know as the mark of the beast and as a christian i will not be doing that it will start as a id pass but the later a bar code tattooed on us and thats how everything will be use is through that bar code
x ray scanner and some lasers would be cool oh and some bubble machines would be nice i dont have this planned out yet i would need to talk to a few people
so instead of building a wall hed rather build a few thousand miles of xray scanners with dropboxes for handwritten explanations of why theyre crossing thats the most ridiculous unefficient money sucking policy ever proposed democrats will love it
no borders no walls but have unconsented radiation to track when undocumented migrants entering ok
governor of new mexico  hes got my vote but instead of giant xrays what if we make mexicans wear those dog shock collars that sends a powerful voltages of current to anyone who attempts to cross the radiowave field  im not sure how it will work exactly but im sure we can talk to some really smart computer programmer guys and they will figure it all out
why was it so short
we are just trying to have a reasonable discussion
someone cite the statistics that say illegal immigrants commit 37 of homicides cause im calling bullshit
love these videos keep the change my mind vids coming pls
i rewatched the woman at the beginning speaking 3 times and i am still not quite sure what the hell she is talking about
according to that guy were going to have to invade all of south america and mexico at the taxpayers expense and radio tag every single individual so we can find out which one of them might enter the us he is a prime example of why the left is so stupid that my head hurts
taxation is theft why fucking pay taxes
loved that look in crowders face at the end
ahso this is how they sell the mark of the beast to the world  never take the mark  do not trust anyone promoting such a thing no matter who they are
i was really looking forward to seeing some conversations on this topic then this happened
haha an xray checkpoint but no boarders  this is the nonsense that is created by the virtue signaling left they have zero actual solutions to the problem but tons of newage ideas
hey can someone tell me how effective this wall will be its sounds about as effective the maginot line during ww2
bordersuh areuh a thinguh of the pastuh fuck thats annoying and a stupid statement
this dude talkin about some kinda orbital vsat
lmaoi waa waiting with everyone else to see what he would say at the end of the conversation with that guy and he just gives the camera that look i freakin love this show
steven is a fucking champ for politely listening to that second guy  yikes
there is this machine its called the us army why build something that wont work they tunnel or create delightful ways of entering the us unnoticed that makes it easier for anyone else that wants to cross over maybe with the means to detonate an explosive device or chem weapon our army would serve as serious deterrent with the mission of protecting the border its not that hard to enter legally unless youve something to hide
we dont need borders we only need a place where people enter the country and get checked um like a border
hopefully he was nervous
wow im mexican and im a little embarrassed by thisthese two have to be the dumbest pair of people ever featured on crowders channel
too short
why build a wall instead it should be a network of surveillance equipment it would cost less and be more effective
manah we just needah xray bordersah wow just wow that look at the end that you gave was priceless you just met the future governor of new mexico 
this guy literally unwittingly shilling for total human enslavement complete with full on police state scanners and id chips  how did we get here
that dude was dumb as fuck and he sounded coked up or something just random shitty ideas with all sorts of intensity behind it i wish you woulda broke his heart and just got up and said i cant even drop mic and walk away but his ignorant ass would be overhelmed with emotion and wanna fight probably
for me this is case closed its illegal its literally a crime so you know its enforcing the law
make all property private then everyone polices his own borders and decides whom to allow and whom to deny very simple immigration reform will do nothing
i saw an ad for crtv on this video maybe youtube isnt so bad
this sucked
steven made a huge mistake illegal immigrants do not commit 35 of all homicides in the country in fact they commit a disproportionately less amount of crimes this can be confirmed by the official ice and us customs and border protection website  wwwcbpgovnewsroomstatscbpenforcementstatisticscriminalalienstatistics
how are you going to debate a person with a mental illness crowder
he wants a xray gate with no wall i always thought gates and walls went together but there ya go the guy is a globalist all the way he wants to know who you are and when youre where
actually 100 of illegal immigrants commit crimes as they are here illegally
this young hispanic guy is a moron  hes a perfect example of how you cant fix stupid
the bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki is justifiable change my mind
this is very scary to see the future intellect of people running for office
then skate that shit change my mind go
leroy is on a sick one xray borders
these peoples arguments are so weakdont put up the wall because that communicates distrust   or theres no reason for itso if we put up the wall to keep people more honest why is this a problem   frankly im getting sick of my taxes going up every year and my healthcare wait get longer and longer every year because of these people that abuse both and arent even people whom are supposed to be here   i say build the damned thing and see if that shit changes   sick of this shit   just do it already
one more point everyone i hear says let the doca kids stay it wasnt their fault i say let their parents stay send the doca kids back the doca kids are the sjws that are demanding free stuff and destroying this country their parents came to work hard and have a better life were keeping the wrong people
mexico has a barbed wire metal fence with sniper towers on their southern borders why cant we oh because we would be racist thats why
73 of illegals sell drugs thats the stat on drug crime from illegals
god i seriously hope this guy never makes it into any political positionthat will only make new mexico fall behind in the us even more
the mexicans interviewed seemed kinda low intelligence surely you must have dismissed all the high iq mexicans that wanted to debate you
that guy wants to be governor of new mexico he couldnt make a complete thought
yeaaa im a texas conservative kinda jumped from the republican train to the libertarian train and fuck the wall buddy
i wasnt pro wall until this episode
lets implant presto cards into our brains thatll help lmfao
i think that it should be easier to immigrate legally here same amount of background checks just faster if thats pissible
a lot of people are angry over the fact that some familys or people that they knowwere deported due to illegal immigrationinstead of getting angryif a better life means so much to you why is it so hardfor oneto properly earn a citizenship the right way it takes effortand paperworki dont think thats asking to much steven talked about this before in a previous video that if we crossed over the mexican boarder illegally it wouldnt bea slap on the wrist and sent home it would in fact mean imprisonment along with other bullshit people need to stop being lazy
well they did elect gary johnson
your face at the very end said it all 
marvel is better than dc in every aspect  change my mind
not gay jared looks so lonely lol
we have always had a wall the only difference is trump wants to make a bigger and better wall then the old worn down ones we have the funny thing is when obama was president bush and clinton nobody ever complained about a wall and we had one then the cold hard truth is they just dont like trump because under obama we had a wall they never said anything the problem is all of these presidents before trump never really enforce the law now you have a president enforcing the law and people have gotten by with it for so many decades it doesnt register in their brain that theyre breaking the law its pretty simple just obey our laws and we wont have a problem
that ending was perfect
wow pathetic just make a video around someone who is uneducated
dude i dont believe in borders instead i want a even more orwellian situation where the border is guarded by thousands of miles of xray telescreens and maybe also robots
ha that dude didnt want a wall he wanted an xray wall
what a good citizen the first lady was if they were making the community worse then get them out i hope she stays safe
mexican intellectuals
no borders in 510 years bullshit
thats right lowjack every human being on the planet so there worlds governments know where every being is thats not over stepping government reach by any measure and surely couldnt go wrong in any way
tell us where you are filming
wow this guy hit a all new level of dumb
omfg this is gold
what is your opinion on tearing families apart at the border i havent heard the whole story so maybe someone can fill me in
featuring the future mayor of new mexico
that guy stupid af lol
has anyone ever changed his mind
how does illegal immigrants threaten your life  lmao yall greedy af just say that and it would be less of an issue
fuck illegals fuck daca fuck sanctuary cities too
they always say it wont work theyll find a way and we already have a fence smh
the first time i heard about the wall i thought it was crazy and then i really thought about it and i was like this man is a genius a wall a real wall hey rid of the chain link fence that does not stop 3rd graders and bring in the great wall of america if they want on they have to work for it
if leeroy becomes governor that place is going to hell even more than it already is guys totally incoherant for having spent alot of time thinking about thisthough the rfid stamping people bit has been a long imagined measure of social control usually in dystopian scify but a few politicians have tried to bring it to congress and the senate in the last 30 years
crowder what are your ideas instead of a wallspanish guy bro ever seen star wars or seven sisters maybe even equilibrium those had good ideasthats pretty much what i got from it
throughout human history theres always been war every war is fought over wealth resources and power although we still have traditional warfare war has evolved immigration is now being used as a weapon of that war in both the us and in europe people like soros have weaponized immigration to take away the freedoms of the west its unfortunate to say but theres a reason most people come here illegally they have little to no education and little to no job skills they cant prosper in their home countries and so they come to america hoping things will be different theyre not when you have no ability to prosper youre more likely to vote for politicians who will give you government subsidies we all know which party that is its the same party that wants higher taxes restrictions on freedom of speech and to abolish the second amendment in 1986 reagan signed an amnesty bill that turned ca from a red state into a blue state its been that way since ca has the entertainment agricultural tech and shipping industries ca also has the highest taxes lowest quality of living the most lawsrestrictions and is 13 trillion in debt people are fleeing because it looks like theres no possibility of changing things thats what the oligarchs want for the entire country they want to turn the united states from a 2 party system into a 1 party system essentially a dictatorship once they do that they will have total power theyll start changing laws restricting freedoms imposing higher taxes and there will be no way to fight what theyre doing america and americans are what keeps the world balanced we fight for those who are oppressed if we become the oppressed then the oligarchs will be free to go after the rest of the worldand while i feel for people who are coming here to try to make a better life for themselves i think there are better ways of doing things we wont be able to help anyone if we destroy the united states trying
nice fanny pack not gay jared
that guy doesnt have a single clue what hes talking about and xray scanner ya lets give the govt the power to chip us governor of new mexico  if you only had a brain n a wall is not feasible but neither is chipping humans
his face at the end had me dying 
this latina wants the wall
de wall is ressus  no se nada  yo no sirve para nada 
the wall is so stupid i predict the wall is going to be used against us mexicans already have all the numbers they need to out birth us and take control then theyre are going to destroy america and mexico is going to use our own wall against us to keep mexicans from returning home we needed the wall 30 years ago its to late now
instead of running across the border and trying to force another country to change its laws why not just protest your own country to change your laws since youre already there we all know the answer to that america is actually being way too nice about illegal immigration to be honest
can you do a climate change one of these
so that guy doesnt believe in border control but he still wants to have some sort of border control with xrays to make sure we know who is coming in what isnt that pretty much a very high tech border wall isnt he against the idea of building a wall to make sure we know who is coming in
do this guy wants everyone to have the mark of the beast
this guy had family in new mexico since the 1500s    heh
scientifical word of the year  2018
that dude sounds high as shit forget the crazy wall lets tag people like cattle and scan them with microwaves
yep just xray the hole lot of them give em some proper radiation sickness right in the 001 nm so it nuks their dna to shit lmao tags are probably impossible to impliment but not a bad idea
what surprised me is how extremely dumb that guy is like him saying he isnt mexican  and then contradicting himself by saying his family had been in mexico since the mid  1500s
rfid chip getting some end times signs from him
lmao dude sounded like a retarded preacher on crackuh
the  cost of a wall would be the same as 3 new aircraft carriers as of last estimate which do we need more
the retarded brown guy with the white shirt and backpack rambling on about no wall no borders is exactly what is wrong with the system this spic is and wants a freeloading lifestyle hes a fuckup whos mother should have shat him into a bucket of water rather than given birth sorry but true
that guy with the taxem and 1984 shit was super weird the first lady and how scared she is was so sad
if we tax them higher than other citizens why even come to the us for a better life if you have to be branded with a number lol with his logic we would have to tag them in mexico hahahaha
why is securing a border controversial all of a sudden
a wall is a waste of money
just build the wall already
too expensive honestly make it less appealing to cross over bigger punishment or promote more legal crossover
i think its awesome when you change up the scene a bit get tired of hearing college students regurgitate the bull their fed in the social whatever classes
meh
1000 this sounds way worse than a wall wtf
that guy is either really high or really stupid
bruh second dude was just terrible he was straight up on the drugs he was talking about crazy incoherent lol
we dont need a wall change my mind  im not trying to sound stupid but help me understand
i find it funny cause down here in south texas the border patrol are all hispanics and latinos and they are proud of their job and do not hesitate to deport illegals
we need to put that dude on the other side of the wall special kind of stupid that one
so this guy who wants to be governor of new mexico thinks his state is a sanctuary city holy crap are we really getting as dumb as this kid in our society
instead of a wall what you americans need is a giant ditch filled with landmines and then a 100 mile kill zone behind that where shooting illegals is legal and encouraged  this is much more cost efficient and excellent sport
shiiiiit his lovely gray hairs fuc  i mean make love to me daddy
the children should help build the wall
the second guest is a fuckin retard  who the f would actually watch this dudes show
it is quite amusing reading the comment section with most everyone thinking the guy was on drugs i hate to break it to you but this level of intelligence is to be expected of the average middle to low income liberal
a lot of this seemed like wild ramblings from uninformed people not a whole lot of constructive conversation
wtf is wrong with a wall and locked doors   it is the only sensible solution to tool up border security
im so glad that guy is not in charge of anything
lets sum up the second guys argument lets just turn the border into an airport customs checkpoint
the first lady who sat down was interesting to listen to and raised valid points of concern the guy who came after her clearly had an iq inversely proportional to the number of words he used
who are the mastermind thinktank friends
more than half illegal immigration involves air travel done
this guy is complaining that a wall would be too expensive how expensive would it be for that xray thing
this guy actually is smarter then the governor of nm and the ones running for governor
i have possibly a just as controversial policy in mind rather than building a wall i think we should get rid of any incentive for illegal immigrants to want to be in the country this is not to say make it so immigrating to the united states is unfavourable what i mean is crack down hard on any incentive illegal immigrants could live here without going through the process legally from my understanding many illegal immigrants stay in the country because they are able to still make a living andor live off the government which leads to little reason to go through the long process of becoming a legal citizen and paying taxes if we were to crack down on their source of cash in the united states then they would have no reason to stay in the country illegally now to help push such a policy through knowing that the left would despise such a policy we would take a percentage of the money that were to be allocated to the wall and put it into streamlining the process to legally enter the united states of course this would not mean skimping out on the regular process but hiring more people andor restructuring some areas could help the process move faster thus allowing more legal immigrants into the country doing this would decrease the amount of illegal immigrants could potentially convience the left of immigration reform and would bring more tax dollars into the states while spending less of the tax dollars on illegal immigrants living off the countryi may be wrong in someall areas my knowledge on all these situations and statistics are limited but to me this seems like a more logical approach to the illegal immigration problem whats at least a bit interesting about this proposed policy of mine is that i wrote about this as the moral approach to immigration in my philosophy class at a very liberal college and i ended up getting an a that surprised me
2nd guy sounded like he was on something
did i just get an ad of your video on your own video thats extremely useless
i have a fence for a reason build the wall
calum von change my mind
that ups truck beeping in the background
these guys were retarded
hey steven you should talk about the elephant trophy that trump is thinking of making it legal maybe its already legal or maybe not im not really sure
i love how steven was slowly leading him to contradict his own idea
we need a scientifical xray stargate at the the border
this moron wants to be a governorof a city fucking retard
steven you didnt even provide links to your new buddies channel 
i can feel my brain cells dying 
yea put chips in them lmaoooo
god help new mexico if that guy becomes the governor
second guys lost me as soon as he sayyeah you know how like someone who talks like that is illiterate and has no philosophical knowledge for me to listen to them i just fast forwarded him he probably barely reads you can tell just by the way he constructs sentences
haha the last super speaker im spanish is the reason you guys need to build a wall if nothing else but to protect the gene pull hes been thinking about it for the past three years and this is the best he can come up with he will breed and drag your intelectual pool further down into the mud
you censored the ladys face but you forgot to censor her nametags although i couldnt see it clearly however an intrepid observer could see it
trumps way behind a wall how about an xray field  zapem n taxem baby
build the wall trump 2020
i agree with your views on a lot of your videos steven crowder but your view on this one and the way you handled the interviews in this video has me think youre just a super republican like a what ever the republicans say im all for it kind of guy
thats almost like tattooing serial numbers onto jews
hey steven you may want to blur out the first ladys name badge too
the rapid advance of technology is only going to increase the need for a physical border also does it need to be said that rfid chips for humans is an incredibly bad idea damn that guys got a screw loose
thats our future  cheech  for governor
lol an xray border
this guys stupidity hurts
iq test at the border door
the second guy used up all your time seemed like a useless idiot
instead of doing issues i would like it if you started doing people for example jordan peterson is right change my mind
this guy lives in la la land
can we make people take an iq test before they voteits getting ridiculous
give leroy a break everyone building a wall is just as silly an idea as a carcinogenic xray boarder
and to add i forgot to saynot all illegal immigrants are mexican anyone from any other country is a potential illegal immigrant and a number of them are probably poor and cant afford the citizenship test and need to work in order to afford it but cant make enough in their own country or threats are too great to wait any longer or they fly in with a passportfake or real and just dont leave and because everyone is looking for mexicans they remain unnoticed
im so embarrassed for the second person who sat down
omg that guy is a retard low iq
im pro security and deportation but ive never seen the numbers for the wall add up i think thats a large part why people make jokes about it even republicans
so we can taxe them means we  we can steal from them they have multiple fake ssn why have borders if no one is going to respect them  so what your saying is invade mexico and make one country
all illegal aliens are criminals every last one broke the law just to be here it really is that damned simple
leftist wont sit down with you because they have no argument
im convinced that we need to build the wall
and what about the wall in israel yea yea fuck you all bunch of hypocrites
taxation is theft
so let me get this straight when they come here just tax  them and make them pass the test or criteria and make money off them hey stupid thats called slavery and you wonder why trump is president also he said that within the next 5 to 10 years there will be no borders sorry i just spit my bud light across the living room floor
lmao i dont think i wouldve uploaded this one
i feel like i might have lost brain cells listening to that last guy
we need border control but i dont feel the wall is the best way to do it people could probably find ways around it
that second guy was asking for a scanning wall basically which would be a form of wallborder control
it seems theres no storage of moral relativism its  definitely running rampant
so wait the guy who sits down at 5 mintues wants no borders but claims we will keep track of people via electronic id well with no border where would we check this either we have a check point where you can enter so said id can be checkedso a fucking border or the id tracks you at all times in which case welcome to big brother
you should really only do these on some type of educational location
please nobody let that guy be governor of anywhere
the wall really is a dumb idea and waste of money itll just get torn down once trump is out of officewe just need to enforce the immigration laws theyre already in place
this guy is like that one guy everybody knows that comes up with million dollar ideas but still doesnt have a job
xray wall jeez why didnt i think of that damn guess i should just throw out the space based solid state laser projector i built piece of junk that was my meal ticket the governor just put me out of business
for me to execute this i would have to get a few masterminded individuals
only let in the people willing to contribute to the society doesnt want to enforce border security
544 sweet baby jesus i cant even with these people the short answer is that the wall is immoral because it uses extorted tax dollars as funding also it will most likely be brought to fruition through the use of eminent domain which is also immoral i saw you bob and weave kokesh actin all offended when he caught you in your logical inconsistency love your show though keep on keepin on but follow your philosophies to there logical conclusion
xray border ah fuck 
how come i only get notified after i watch the video
i was born and raised in new mexico about an hour from santa fe and that guy is an embarrassment and an ignorant loser
anyone who is against a border wall should be prohibited from having doors or security systems on their homes
should do a part two this segment sucked nobody really even had an answer plus it was too short
these are gold keep them coming
watch adam ruins the borderwall by adam conover who explains how the borderwall would make immigration worse of an issues
the way that guy talks with putting an uh at the end of every thing hes says really irritated me
the guy that got interviewed went full retard
no benefits to any undocumented immigrants  that is the only way to stop this mess
i would think the statistics for illegal immigrants committing crimes would be 100 lol thats why they call them illegal immigrants
wow
the future governor of new mexico is this fucken moron serious this jackass basically just suggested chipping people like animals and tracking their movements for a more free and open society i fucken knew liberals were orwellian fascist in disguise damn that guy was a fucken idiot
wow that last guy he he was nice not very bright but nice first of all you dont use xrays to scan any sort of implanted chip unless you want to fry the shit out of it youre way too high on the electromagnetic spectrum youre looking for radio waves specifically rfid something i thought everyone knew abouthonestly who the hell would listen to that guy talk
removing all borders would remove all government cant have social benefits without borders
my opinions will trigger you  change my mind
as a hispanicamerican im embarrassed by how this guy is expressing himself hes ridiculously inarticulate
making us new mexicans proud  sarcasmincaseyoureanidiot futurenewmexicangovernermyass
you happen to post this today today what a way to get clicks right
that was it most of your change my minds are like an hour long
1000 man that guy is an idiot lol
i have to say i am against the illegals in our country i mean if u come here normally its because you have nothing to hide you are looking for a better life and is willing to express that life freely without trying to hide it i mean u can become a citizen here as well but those who come as illegals there are many who are committing wrong now the wall yes would prevent illegals from coming but thats only on foot or by car theres still boats and planes lets just think out of our whole country 37 of crimes are by illegals out of those illegals its mainly the cartels and gang related community those gangs have a shyt ton of money so they can buy thier way in or just fly or a boat they got the money the wall would only stop those fleeing from their country to find safety put urself in their shoes this wall wont bring down that 37 percent because that is controlled by powerful gangs who can easily find another way in we would only build a wall to waste money and stop those who actually need help and safety from coming in i mean even if the wall could bring that percentage down by a lot who is going to pay for it nobody
im a legal immigrant and taxing illegals who come is one thing but what abut the illegals who kill or commit crime  im sorry bit that i guy against the wall is retarded
build the wall
xray border 
that dude may not be high but he definitely has partaken in lots of them
trump should impeach
i dont think that guy knows how xrays work i think he was more or less describing a gps tracking system but i dont think many would be very happy about their privacy being invaded
crowder is proof that a legal immigrant can be a great american
love stevens walther tshirt
i get my notifications anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes after ive watched your vid
a xray machinemetal detector just one at a courthouse costs like 15k imagine what that would cost to cover the entire border yeah i like the wall better
wish i could half like this it just wasnt long enough
this guy sounds like hes been dumbed down by happy meals all his childhood
without illegal immigration our economy would collapse large corporations dont have the money to pay minimum wage to all undocumented people and if you deport them all no one will want to do their jobs
holy dude had an iq of 72 there didnt heffs
as stupid as the guys solutions was hes the only guy ive seen in this change my mind series that talks about solutions to the topic rather than get offended and insult steven
that second guy just didnt want to say he agreed
my family has been in america for over 500 years yet i still have an incredibly strong accentchange my mind
and thats why i moved from new mexico to texas
the second person is stupid he had an idea that makes sense sure but then why have boarders or legal immigration
im not mexican my family has been here since the 1500sjust ignore my thick foreign accent
leroy 2020
the ending was me the whole time the spanish guy was talking
my dog has a chip he pays no taxes
death from above shirt baby
that guy is not spanish lol
what surprises me is that lady is now dead thanks to you i can read her name on her fucking dogtag rofl
wow that 2nd guy is literally calling for the one world order
wow does that last dude work for nasa cause he is a true space cadetlol why is it that when when the younger generation try to think of solutions for tough problems they go full retard
tax the illegal inmigrants whatkdbfb 
next time i get pulled over by the police i will state  i cant answer you that i would need to find some mastermind individuals and sit down with them
at 1012 steven is looking at the guy like can i please just go home 
that guy is watching too many movies smh
im a mastermind individual
this guy watched too much scifi movies
with respect to your second guest the problem is dumb people dont know that they are dumb
honestly this is kinda sad its crazy how little people really now about this topic
stevewe need a pt 2 with someone with half a brain cell
build the wallbuild it tallmaga
omfg  this guy is so unintelligent that listening to him has given me ear cancer
506 im not mexican im spanish my family been in mexico seen the fifteen fifties thats the dumbest thing ive heard every mexican family has a spanish ancestor from the fifteen fifties thats like an american claiming hes english because his family came from england to the us in the fifteen fifties really stupid from him to claim that you are an american who has mexican ancestors and tradition thats the truth
x ray gate
for her safety you should have blurred out her whole body and changed her voice especially if she was from that area
bro im not even mad at this dude he was off the wall im dying lmao
steven crowder you were treading lightly
that bitch gone wind up dead
i would like to apologize on behalf of hispanics for this guy and his genius ideas he doesnt represent us
short shorts
every time i see one of these i think it cant get any better wrong everytime keep up the good fight you guys rule
you changed my entire political views with your channel
this may be one time i could sit down with you and actually have a stance different from yours i want tighter restriction on immigration in this country but i feel the wall is a finacial sinkhole and it would be better to just buy mexico and make it a providence like puerto rico and use their border wall to south america to keep immigrants at bay while improving mexico itself it would be a more worthwhile investment than a border wall i say this because the border of the us and mexico is so big while the one for mexico to south america is so small
scientifical xray border with like uh data points all over the cities and uh lets just make reality uh into minority report featuring tom cruiseical and such
esse is a friggin geenyus meng he should go back to mexico and work for masa the mehican space administration i hear they are hiring
holy shit that last guy was retarded
i feel like that guy was only there to get a free shout out lol
scientifical 
scientifical
holy shit someone plz comment he has got something goin here thats a great idea
i think that a wall is useless a lot of people south of the us border come here to work and they dont collect taxes they just pay into the system which benefit the economy drug cartel  wherever they come from find a way to sneek in drugs and lets be honest its no sneeking when your beloved government is in on it beside in the long run the us will have to ask china for more money when comstruction and maintenance become too much of a burden which war will get us out of this shithole next a civil war trump is already dividing us
holy cow that guy was on some drugs
this guy was at least understanding of the problem and gave a solution viable or not he sided with his side but still tried to come up with a way to make it work so respect
that dude was high af
xray border this is great free flowing xray border of tax paying immigrants hmm
if a wall were to be built it would have to surround the entire country through the caribbean sea pacific and atlantic oceans and over top at canada the money resources and potentially even loss of life dealing with water construction would be too great to he worth the effort and it would take too long the next presidents could easily say yeah we know a lot of time and money has been put into this but we dont agree with it so were shutting it down and it would just be a hassle if we put a wall at the boarder at mexico theyll still get in via the water theyll just come over like the cubans in rafts and if theyre really determined theyll make their way up north still in rafts n stuff and come in through canada or the easternwestern shorelines
i like the last guy lets micro chip all the mexicanslatinos like dogs
the wall is a good thing how could anyone be against it
1 too expensive2 it wont stop shit3 httpswwwnytimescominteractive20180330upshotcrimeimmigrationmythhtml
its too bad we cant just use sensors remotely manned and automated systems to police the boarder walls are so bronze age ew
i support the president change my mind pretty please
you probably should of blurred the woman at the beginning completely and changed her voice just a future safety thing for your guest
all illegal immigrants are committing a crime so the crime they commit isnt disproportionate if you look at the likelihood of a criminal committing another crime
did he really just say scientifical
a wall wont stop anybody  ending the drug war might
i dont want my tax payer money going into paying a stupid wall that wont stop criminals or drug trafficking coming into the country the only thing an expensive big ass wall big enough to make it difficult to go above through under or around it is going to do is make stupid ignorant rednecks happy
the fact it was in austin and you couldnt find anyone to sit down with was pretty shocking  it really speaks to people just wanting to cry and rant about trump but dont have any actual solutions themselves
link to the xray borders youtube or website
worst one yet a rare miss
dude clearly does not want his mind changed
well at least these guys werent super hype like those white liberals at college campuses smh
1316 stevens reaction is priceless 
that spanish dude is a moron
how do you restrain yourself  so much in not calling them idiots to their faces
the look at the end priceless
the drugsuh
im not even watching this can you do it again in a more well educated community that can put together coherent statements please
yeah lets just cattle tag everybody i get he was just openly thinking and im against the wall but that was a weird one
your a fucking mistake walking broskie
that guy had know idea and his border control ideas unrealistic
i am sooo glad that trump is finally forcing the left to take a stance usually they hide behind the  but reply  no no i am for legal immigration  but  bla bla bla bla and what you saying is just raciest then talk for an hour and never get to what they really thinktrump has a way of making the left show their cardsthese are the same socialist bunch that was around in the 60s but like a bunch of dumb arses we let them get their hooks into the media and the schools now they are assembly lining dip shits en mass
lol all you guys talking about build the wall build the dome
the only problem i potentially see with the wall is that walls also keep people in   the surveillance state is already frightening enough  with a big beautiful wall there is no way to flee then from future despots
this aint futurama bro youd have to find willing people who want that chip on a lesser not i really hope that lady gets protection and is still safe
mr crowders face at the end was a rather sedate reaction to that shockingly selfcontradicting position proferred by leroy
sigh that dude with the camera
omgembarrassing for new mexicojesus cant we catch a break i promise there are a few smart people in new mexico
a spanish guy thats a bimbo
in an ideal world there would be no borders but our cultures are so different we have to sadly look at japan their culture fosters an incredibly low crime rate i heard they let in ten migrants and two or four of them got arrested thats 2040until all crime rates throughout countries are near zero we need borders and thats just one reason we need to be able to keep track of everyone if youre undocumented if someone murders you we have no way to identify your body and get you justice its not just for the host countrys sake its the immigrants safety as well
so we should tag people like cattle to track them this is a solution this is better than a geographical border wall so i guess he is for making a continuous series of scanning stations in order to prevent circumventing his cockamamy idea sounds like a wall to me
my man never posted his video i can tell you that for sure 
this guy is a real genius  
people are retarded
enforce the laws change them if necessaryand build the wall where it will be effective
i want communism and open boarders that will solve all the problems that could ever happen i will tax the rich to achieve this it will work forever with no flaws ever ever
heheheh xd
you know right
tax the illegals lolwhat the ones that arent on welfare
more and longer change my mind videos please
racist ass nigga
what the hell
that guys on too many druggssuhh
1318 he looks so helpless for some reason  i do like that hes trying be be as impartial as possible not condescend or strong arm people debating this and the last cmm he did hopefully it would be the same for when he revisits college campuses
the look on his face after leroy left was priceless
xrays  well that wraps up that problem easy
doesnt want a border and then proposes a border system and in typical democrat fashion tax them
if this stupid wall wasnt going to make people rich and provide jobs for thousands id be completely against this dumb idea a wall will only deter crime but it will come over and under eventually
xrays are the future
you cant even imagine how many terror attack the gaza wall prevents with the border check every day
i had this same conversation with my dad last sunday on fathers day
every single one was retarded
the last dude was from the future from cyberpunk 2077
these  change my mind videos are going downhill fast can we find someone with an iq over 60 to debate
i was born in santa fe and i would like to say not all of us are like this
so this guys for and x ray wall but not a concrete oneookkkk
im gonna cry yall  build that big beautiful wall 
the earth is round change my mind
leroy is an idiot borders are going to be s thing of the past wtf and he wants to tax illegalshow does he expect them to be rounded up to enforce that  againhes a complete idiot using nonwords such as scientifical and masterminded individuals smdha new holocaust for idiotsliberals would seriously help our future
the frightening thing is when the apple ichip gets released the world will think it is great just like this guy never thinking through its implications  beastsytem nwo
get everyone in all the illegals and give them citizenship right away and tax them people dont try to get citizenship you cant tax illegals because you dont know where they are working under the table and you cant get a id tag someone that quasars over a wall and not through a border with a passport legally
only 13 minutes
is it cheaper to target the demand for illegal immigration or to build a wall say those that employ illegal labourer face prison would that reduce demand
thanks for the quality sustenance
why does she have a plant in a soda bottle
free thought  in order to execute this he would need to get some masterminds xray id  with explanation  huh   the icing on the cake his name is leroy does anyone know a smart leroyreal question
i want to do one now the earth is flat change my mind
there is something seriously wrong with that dudecant beleive someone like that has so much confidence in his stupidity that hes live streaming in public and wants to become mayor if he ever does run liberals would probably elect him just like theyve elected mad maxine watters nancy polygrip pelosi and crying chuck schumer
look at the back of the dudes neck
lets let el chapo set up open meth and heroin markets and have  cartels war on our streets that way refugees wont have a reason to leave their countries america will be just like the place they left so there will be no insensitive to come here we can all live in utopian favellas like brazil itll be great our kids wont have to worry about school shootings theyll be at war on the streets and everyone can get in on it a true leftist paradise and just like that poor lady we as good citizens will be afraid in our own neighborhood to tell on these guys sounds great
this man all the way out in left field 
democraps want to ensure a criminal peasant underclass to maintain their supply of votes clean toilets and heroin
if you build a wall would you not only keep them out but keep yourselves in idk lol
can you still do the brain voice
the spanish guy is retarded  wants to be governor but said scientifical
i dont even really support building a wall but god damn i admire your patience and understanding in these segments
did this man really say he isnt mexican cause his ancestors from 1550 were spanish but lived in new mexico which let me remind you was mexico for the longest time until manifest destiny look buddy youre mexican own up to it theres sadly a lot of mexicans who deny being mexican and say theyre dead ass spaniard af while looking like a whole beaner  come on now
im spanish my family has been in mexico since the 1550s bro you are mexican or mexican american that or i am english
this guy is as high as a kite alll illegals have committed a crime  they are part of the cartel they steal identities to work they skip out on er bills with fake id info they drive without a valid us driver license they are known to be loan sharks and shake down legal immigrants in areas like santa ana in caliyou try doing that shit as someone legally here and you get deported you try doing that as an american and you get your ass thrown in jail illegals dont get double standards cuz they want to break the law and say f u to every american and legal immigrantmexico should do the no border law first since they have a zero illegal policy and mexico should destroy the wall they built to keep these people outmost illegals arent mexican the travel a
this guy is not the brightest
need to do another pro gun
condelingus rice sounds like a mexican dish maybe we should put her on a plane and send her back to mexico so the mexicans can eat her
buildthewall
so make an xray wall
that last guy didnt seem very smart but he was at least very imaginative
rip x
that second guy sounds like the burger king foot lettuceuuuh guy
well mr new mexican i will not be voting for you i was born and raised in albuquerque new mexico and you sound extremely typical
crowder just do me a favor and stop calling yourself a libertarian and not because of closed borders
i wouldnt elect leroy to be the secretary for a local hoahe is clueless
the second dude was on one for sure
this guy is living in 3018
xray wall  lol
the wall is useless it is genuinely a waste of money and will not keep out people who are dedicated to committing crimes walls can be used to keep people in just as effectively as keeping people out we humans are all one manifestations of consciousness expierencing reality from different points of view love conquers fear walls are a physical manifestation of fear
lol its a free thought thing scientifical magnetic scanner xray thing blah blah blah brain in the blender with diarrhea of the mouth leroooy
i was fully expecting the alia intro to play after that intro
that guy is dumb as
that last guys solution was sooooo far and stoopid but god i want to have a smoke and drinks with him soooo bad lmao
i am mexican and i have nothing against the wall but mxico is not paying for it the wall is an american solution that didnt involve the mexican government therefore the us is the one paying if only the us was more open to dialogue instead of abusing its power to force other countries to cooperate we would have a better solution for both countries but i cant imagine trump doing that after all the wall is one of the reasons he won btw the us is open to dialogue with shithole countries only if they have nukes aka north korea
leroy has an iq of 80 and is high as a kite
that look at the end
look at jared trying to be ba in the background  love you guys keep trying to educate
build the wall  interviewing retards
huh scanners tags x rays wtf you smoking brah
a drug war is a crime on reality learn biology learn how drugs are made look up maps read up on how dopamine works how drugs like caffeine work on the same receptor sites as the  hard stuff then make your decisions even prescribed drugs that are heavily controled and in my opinion are caught out because of such status like alprazolam arent much different in effect or how they work on the brain in comparison to alcohol which actually raises the level of the barbaturate phenobarbital in the brain in my opinion more education more freedom and a libertarian approach to drugs would be more effective at curbing drug dependence drug dealing related violence and drug related immigrant based crime then a wall
thats what i call cringertainment
next do ls is better than coyote change my mind
please do 3rd wave feminism is useless change my mind
second person is a fucking idiot   slow as shit rolling uphill 
since fbi statistics combine white and hispanic races into one category where is an official source that cites the 37 murder rate by illegal immigrants
i mean i dropped out of college so im no team of masterminds and surely not one to pass judgement on the future president of new mexico but props to you for not breaking down into laughter about the blatant scientifical maybe i dunno free flow x ray wall
this man foshou smoked a blunt before sitting down
this was a bad episode lol only one guy talking and hes sort of loony
interested to see where this was filmed in  new mexicans are stupid in general we are close to last if not last in education
scientifical xray thingy just being blatant i havent thought this out yet no way seems like youve studied this
wall is a waste of fucking money and can be defeated by a well placed ladder it will just alienate people and fuck up food chains for animals living on the borderwe should probably clean up our legal paths into the country just because it makes things easier for everyone involvedcorrect me if im wrong but we dont have to let anyone in from that direction and whatever happens happens and we dont have to take shit from anyone because we arent required to care
who wears short shorts
we dont need a wall  the us space marines are going to install a laser curtain down from orbit  try climbing it you communists
meanwhile mexico hates illegal immigration from its southern border
yothis dude is retarded his brain is fried
the second person to sit down adds an ah to the end of like 50 of his sentencesah
this guy was high
wtf was that guy talking about he s delusional as fuck
1028 build that xray scanner
i got a been shapiro add
lets just fry everybody with xrays lmao so they can end up like this guy lol burnt the heck out and cant even speak think or do anything properly lmao
420  we may find areas where we disagree vs areas where we disagree  haha
this is a stupid fucking ideainstall a minefield and use hunterkiller drone fleets for fucks sake return on investment is way better
governor of new mexico dont come near my state
i think borders in general are going to be a thing of the past boi what
i think the second buy did drugs
god is it just me or do you also cringe when you hear some one butcher the english language i grew up in a pretty bad latino ghetto but i made a point not to sound like that man
ill bet the last guy was an illegal immigrant
that mexican is huge idiot
damn it steven stop putting my people on camera we obviously dont do good good video though
get rid of welfare as an incentive to come here
if youre gonna come to my country come here legally good job president trump for starting to build the wall just what hispanic americans need good work on president trump on starting constructionno borders no countryamericafirstbuildthewallsecuretheborder
yikes that guy was talking some orwellian new world order globalist cuckery do not vote for him
at no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul
that guy is so exhausting to listen to
that second guy was a trip
priceless endofsegment mug ftw
i tried taking the guy serious but i couldnt after he started talking about xrays
this was one of the craziest shit i ever seen
need to put a wall around new mexico too trying to get rid of the old mexicans dont need any new mexicans
this spanish dude was next level el stupido
literally had a ad for the show before the showl
i want to limit legal immigration too
an xray border somebody get this man a team of masterminds asap
respectfully this man is stupid how in hell are we going to electronically id people that have never been to america and how are we going to create a xray border that identifies these people and what would that even accomplish
buildthewall  deportthemall
republicans arent racist  change my mind
so people will be able to travel very fast and very cheap in the next 5 years but we should tax them and boarders will not exist furthermore we should have an xray scanner that reads the id chip that is somehow implanted in everyone wtf was that guy going on about
a spanish senior called leroy that wants to be the mayor of new mexicoi call bullshitand why does he want everyone that crosses the border to be blasted with radioactive x rays does he want them to develop cancer
the one spanish guy actually had a good point why not make money off of them by taxes it would show whos doing illegal stuff too because they wouldnt report their taxes and wouldnt try to become a citizenedit okay didnt watch it all xray borders haha i think he was just super nervous and panicking to come up with an idea
leroy said nothing
wow that second dude was spouting so much nonsense and is so inconsistent what a moron
cant tell if the guy was trolling or just incredibly naive
xray border man 2020
as soon as yiy get an electronic tag you are automatically a slave to the system this guy clearly on some next level opioid kind of shit comparing illegal crossing the border to the technology
i have a solution make illegal immigrants conditional temporary residents no access to welfare and paying a fine for entering illegally and be deported for any violent crime or felony conviction and a mandatory sentence upon reentry based on convictions of said crimes and previous deportations i have an illegal aunt and cousins theyre always in fear of deportation they arent here to commit crimes or take advantage of the government shes here for an opportunity and not all immigrants are in the same category so we need to stop putting them in one category im sure hundreds of thousands of people in that situation would not hesitate to take that deal the ones that dont are criminals lets make people that can be productive help this country excel and the garbage funnel out through their actions and enforcement ps if a bill like this would be endorsed by conservatives the liberals would lose there backing and we would be better suited to fight for the 2nd amendment with the support of the hispanic vote just food for thought people got to be closed minded
tag people with rdif chips and taxsteal money from they wtf
not to mention mexico has their own southern border walland tons of countries have border walls to prevent their country being taken over by other countries and illegal immigrantsand the border walls actually work over in the eastand no criticism what baffles me is nearly every president has said they are for border security but then dont follow through trump is actually following through on his campaign promises and gets critisized very harshlywhy i use to work for western unionmoneygram and tons of illegal immigrants would send thousands of money they made in the us to their home country on a regular basis which ultimately robs our economy i would see a lot of fake passports when trying to send even larger amounts of money which get declined so most would break up the money into separate transactions using other friends to send the money over as a way around presenting a legit id or passport
good video but bring unfortunately
1 no chance this guys not mexican and his family came in the 1550s  not possible bro2 yea forget a wall lets just build a 1900 mile long xray machine  3 oh yea passports and tattoo a fckin bar code on them at birth  oh wait just make these people that are undocumented pass a test lmfao  if someone could please tell this guy that when you cross the border you have to show a passport majority of the time go through an xray machine and write why youre in the country thats so brilliant it might just not work so scientifical  so free flowing to track humans via barcode lmao future new mexico governor right here
how do you check that with out a borderwall uh urr duh hurr im not smart enough lmao
love the checkerboard vans tho 
build that xray border build that xray border
jesus crowder maybe you could have blurred out her entire image come on man
what nice people who just dont seem to be thinking at all were seeing real time cognitive dissonance
build it
that guy was an idiot
funny how they talk about immigration and always thinking hispanics little do they know that their are more illegal people coming from asia europe and africa why talk about the people coming from mexico drugs
the wall is a huge waste of money
so dude there wants to just go to a different country and start microchipping people at random in case they decide to go cross the usmexico unborder xray radar laser wifi star trek gate that doesnt exist because it would be border security and borders are bad gotcha clear as brick
that guy is fully retarded
build the wallmake welfare recipients pay for it
build the freaking wall put sniper towers on it and let the chips fall where they may  i dont care if that lady cries even though she did seem like a nice lady
the look on your face at the very end of the video spoke volumes
the glass is half fullplease lets not be dumb enough to overflow it if we spill things shit will hit the fanon a humid summer day
the mexican dudes has to be high
this mf was definitely stoned for this convo
why does leroy keep adding extra vowels to the ends of words
so i agree with nearly all of your ideas and thoughts on most of these matters however i just cant get behind this idea i mean i can overall understand the issues with this but i just dont understand the point of a wall i would like border enforcement and further actions taken but i dont understand why putting a mini great wall of china there would help
it would cost billions if not trillions and as it turns out walls have not kept people out of a place since the a few hundred years ago kinda stupid idea tbh
i am against illegal immigration but i think the wall is a massive waste of money and resources it blows me away how much traction the wall has gained because its such a retarded solution theres already a barrier between mexico and usa i mean they have tunnels leading all the way into california a big ass wall wont change that
i wish i could of been there to change your mind usually i agree with you but the wall is just a dumb idea logistically and financially its a disaster
wow that leroy guy genius
build the walldeport them all
i think that most people shouldnt be allowed to vote time to implement starship troopers law
1318 pause it there and you get a thousand words just from that face
so this guy is against borders and his solution is a global government tracking program how high did this bastard get before this there are some dumb people in this world
the downside i can see with the wall is just money how much is it gonna cost and im pretty sure its gonna take years to build fullyalso theres a risk of the wall being built then out of nowhere its construction is cancelled and all the money that is already gone it is now gone to waste and giving liberals more fuel to add
tax them uhhhhh
word  uhhh
i feel like after watching mr drugs ramble on i have become less intelligent
this dude is brain dead lol he wants chaos lol no boarders  lol
so leroy do me a favor when you go and amass your group of masterminds find someone who can work out that one tiny little detail that you seem to not understand we already have gates and illegals choose to go around them
sorry but is that guy ok
the trouble with the world is that stupid people are cocksure bertrand russel
well america needs stricter immigration laws for sure but building a wall doesnt look good america is built on freedom and a wall just looks oppressive almost
how can a person sign up to lwc if heshe isnt a student in a university 
911 was an inside job change my mind
that end shot haha
318 the look
the last guy described the movie idiocracy
just start shooting them for trespassing on federal land problem solved
 cheap prick
as a new mexican you would defiantly not have my vote if you ran for governor lmao that was embarrassing for new mexicans smh
dude in white is a dumbass
this is interesting i thought people in texas would want the wall
this guy just described legal immigration
two moronic guests  what a shame
hahahah 250 they have the white guy robbing the mexicans thats a fucking joke
hey stevencrowderi love your channel and mugclub but putting in this clip can put this lady in danger the people theyre talking about they dont play
i think not gay jared is packing around his waist there securezza
dude is advocating for 1984
this is so dumb the correct response is ladders
he said i want to be the mayor of new mexico he has me dead lol
its simple just build a borderwide xray scanner that magically tags everyone who comes infucking hell this guy is one dense motherfucker
xxxtentacions death made me sad change my mind  
my goodness arguing with these people is like trying to climb a mountain of nails
this was like one if those videos where people interview 7 year olds about politics for the comedic value of their answers
dang i was disappointed with this change my mind a great topic to have a political debate over but people were not willing to have an open discourse the only two people in the video could hardly complete a sentence let alone formulate a logical argument
except maybe colombia south american and caribbean countries are socialist shitholes illegal are bringing that socialist crap with them and if they are given citizenship and right to vote they will turn the us into a socialist shithole send them the illegals all back and build the wall
this made me cry stupid leftists and their ideology are hurting good people they have no morals
holy shit xray scanners lol
when you are high as fk and have a million trillion grandiose ideas but when you open your mouth and cant get a coherent sentence out
the way that dude makes a extra sound after the last word of every sentence tells me hes on stimulants no im not saying thats everybodys habit thats on stimulants but he definitely got some extra energy
biometric scanner is the word hes looking for
lord can i please have the last 1344 minutes of my life back  please
hahahahaha xray i dont know if i should laugh or feel sad for him because he seems mentally challenged
200k iq
not sure if this guy understands but to funnel people through a gate there needs to be a fucking wall either side or people will simply walk around it what a dunce love that look from crowder at the end there 
why did i get an ad for a democrat running for governor 
i think the wall would be a waste of money because of the tunnels what about the tunnels 
xray scanner with a data baseuhand theyll just decide to go throw a scanner
they keep getting dumber and dumber
well at least the guy has ideas not exactly good ideas but ideas
could you please post the statistics you use in these change my mind segments i would like to be able to use them in my own debates
i like how the people at the beginning saw your sign and just broke sown and screamed your ass because they couldnt come up with something clever
what the hell was that moron talking about he wants to rfid tag people  no thanks
his family has been in new mexico since the 1550s huh
just make it a minefield  with signs  or not
dude needs to change out his bong water  omg what a fing wastoid
what in the world is this guy on this just makes me want the close the border even more
give them the right to vote and make them pay taxeswe already tried this in 1920  they have since voted themselves unsustainable amounts of money most will die never paying net taxes and theyre still demanding more free stuffbut sure lets try it again its not like weve spent a century proving it doesnt work
much more humane than a wall microchip all mexicans like pets good idea guy
xray border man wants to be the governor of new mexicoyeah i died
he thinks they pay taxes 139 billion welfare pay out but they only pay 130 million a year 
the spanish guy in the white t shirt was an idiot
i am sure confused with the person he first talked to
welcome to america heres your complimentary rfid butt plug enjoy
guy with spanish accent families been here since the 1550s eh that guy seemed like he was on meth or some kind of upperor just has a lot of anxiety
steves face at the end cracked me up best wtf look ever
no borders no culture no language no country
build that fucking wall
the first un cut interview was pretty good
that look at the end
comedy gold
let me assert my position first because we might find some areas where we disagree versus areas where we disagree 420  as much as i enjoy these segments i think this freudian slip says a lot i really dont believe that you want or that it would be possible for anyone to change your mind on these subjects
1054 this kid wants citizens to get essentially chipped cause illegal immigration fuck that stop the whole lot shoot them where they stand were full
this man must think we are living in the future
this channel has disappointed me  i was hoping for someone with conservative viewpoints thats open to logical discussion  however after viewing several of your videos its clear that is not the case  very unfortunate  youre merely here to push your own viewpoints which youve already convinced yourself are correct on other people
who let this idiot speak for hispanics
these people were so fucking funny not the brightest bulbs on the panel this time crowder lol
this is about to reach a million fastlol
as a life long resident of new mexico i would move if leroy was ever put on the ballot for governor
we need to build a barbed wire fence system 100 yards south of the mexican wall and a barbed wire fence a hundred yards north of the wall we can put signs on the barb wire fence anyone beyond this point will be met with lethal force if they happen to get by that and over the wall then we have another hundred yards to apply lethal force i think we would have 0 illegal crossings as american citizens if we go beyond a certain point at area 51 we are met with lethal force so why not illegals
lmao that first mexican dude is fvcking ignorant talking about fvck a wall put in an xray scanner across the entire border 
wtf was that second person talking about
scientifical 
who are the ones salling the drugsa
that one self described spanish dude didnt want a wall he wanted frickin xray laser grid  so much cheaper and more practical than a wall right
lasers sharks sharks with lasers
the guy at the end was clearly a slave to group think nothing worse than a confident stupid person
im pretty sure the guy in the white shirt was strung out on something hes obviously uneducated on the topic of immigration but he was all over the place he would just throw random crap against the wall and hope it stuck
this guy is deranged
an xray border with people bringing notes on why they want to come inwhy havent we thought of this before facepalm this is so stupid oml
the man at the end had no coherent thoughts sweet christ
1550s and scientifical lmfao gov of new mexico  just wow 
if that dude is on the ballot for governor of nm i will drop everything and move back to that god forsaken state native born new mexican silver city cobre highshcool fool and run against his dumbassoh bye the way im hispanic tooi say build the wall and man it with recon snipers
without a wall whats stopping immigrants from just going around the xray gate
farmers ceuticals 
really just scientifical
if they dont build the wallthen put a price on the illegals heads
i seriously hope the second guest does not have many listeners to his talk show the man needs to start working towards a career when fast food because i dont think hes smart enough to do anything else
can you film another one i need more 
what about the 10000 kids that showed up without parents why are children being shipped across the border like cattle
you need to require an iq test before you let someone get up there and ramble for 20 minutes this was a massive waste of my time that ill never get back and i feel more ignorant after listening to this  seriously though if you start talking to someone and can tell within the first 30 seconds that theyre more than likely on a second grade reading level tell them thanks and say goodbye move on to the next this seriously isnt doing anyone any benefit other than giving dumb people youtube air time 
that guy is so stupid
the wall itself is a stupid idea i mean trump even defeated it in his own speech hahaha idk maybe a rope lmaomexicans arent stupid they come up with clever ideas to get around the wall heard of the weed catapult plane drops tunnels mules etc the wall is stupid and pointless or at the very least stupid to build such an expensive and massive wall to the level that trump wanted it would be cheaper to save the billions of dollars and hire massive amounts of people that patrolscope out the border looking for crossers1 billion dollars can pay for 16666 people at 60 grand for 1 year to drive around the 1954 miles of the border the wall is gonna cost what like 70 billion thats 70 years of patrolling or even better just set aside 10 years worth for patrolmen and develop ai cameras that can detect movement within 12 miles and alert patrols to head that way drones even too to keep an eye on them that way you can have better more efficient surveillance 247 that doesnt get tired and cant be bribed to look the other waythe wall is stupid use your brain to think of better solutions a wall will not solve anythingshould there be at least a sturdy but cheaper to install fence with barbwire or something like that sure why not at least not let them walk right in unsecured plus you can put motion sensors or something to detect people climbing over it and alert patrols to their position with cameras to verify false alarms or diversion tactics
blurs out her face but not her keycard on her neck nice
get rid of an overreaching leftist legislator or politician get a free citizenship
thats not a bad idea if the have some sort of tracker on them when the come into the country we can make sure they have a job and housing ect then they can earn their citizenship by proving they can live here respectfully
we shouldnt enforce the border but we should make sure we know who is coming into the country
fuck the wall and fuck donald trumpchange my mind
that woman may end up in a ditch on the other side of the wall now
the second person either cant articulate themselves well or they arent very smart 
what are seriously only these two people i was hoping for a real conversation about that goofy dude lol
why hasnt the wall been built yet
the xray borderxraywhere are those mastermind individuals
what a waste of money we are in debt and these idiots think the wall and a space force are a good idea what the hell happened to conservative spending no wall no socialist programs small government try those out
but illegals are documented we cant tax them
this is just like all those clips of americans not knowing their history etc you just cherrypick this stuff and dont talk to experts and such like imagine a debate competition where you got time to research and study vs somebody who just found out what the debate topic would be dont fucking act like your opinion is 100 right when its not a fair fight
honest question  how do we insure that those crossing have the correct immunizations so that they dont get polio measles mumps rubella or that they dont bring those maladies into the country  venezuelans are starting to have higher cases of polio due to their situation and they are taking it into other countries
i love how that guy wanted no borders because they are a thing of the past but he kept on proposing ideas that would require some kind of border and checkpoint system he should have really thought this over before making himself look like an idiot
why is trump not going after the companies why not also punish the dealers they are also breaking the law
i support the wall and yes im mexican every country should have one and trump is a great president but i didnt like when he said meixcans are rapists and shit but i support the wall 100
lol last guy hosts a show called go green drops the most fascist idea since 1936 though lol
the zoom at the end was beautiful
 genius passcodesuuhhh great ideauhh
build the wall
hate to say it but can we deport that new mexico guy  he seems sketchy and dangerous
you should do a trumpreagan was a good president change my mind
as much as i love technologyknow it is advancing rapidly that 510 year for fast transportation is overly optimistic as is his id system  meh either way i am glad you respect those who have a differing opinionarguing against your change your mind topics
that look into the camera at the end  pricelessthe thought of that guy becoming the governor of new mexico  wow
httpsyoutubenlpsfesw4y i recommend everyone to watch this video it talks about why we should be the wall how we should build the wall and what to do with the 11 million illegal immigrants already in the us
future governor of new mexico everybody
illegals are shitholers from one big shithole
that guy is mentally retarded
this was weird 
what a dumbass this guy wants to build a two thousand mile xray border that will run 24 hours a day 7 days a week for ever how many people a year would that kill 1 months power bill would cost more than the wall 
so im gathering the best that liberals in that immediate area could come up with to defend their position was build the wall with your ass very stimulating and thought provoking pointsill need to ponder that for awhile
it wont stop the drugs unless you wall the entire country even then it wouldnt
everyone you interviewed would easily embrace a fascist dictatorship they are completely misinformed and have no understanding what it is to be a us citizen
dam this guys is stupid
the solution to illegal immigration is to make them citizens yes and while were at it we can solve theft by making people pay for things
that guy was an idiot i wouldnt even know how to respond him 
i love your shit dude but i really wish the people you talk to were more better i prefer a good debate over you talking to morons
personally i just feel the wall is a waste of money and recourseschange my mind
waring this is all coming from a canadian perspectivei believe that a physical wall wont be a solution i am for police tolls at the border the wall will cost trillions of us dollars to stretch from end to end plus all of matinence for the wall and security guarding the wall building the wall also might keep illegal immigrants in the states because if they leave the states they cant come back so they probably will just start to live in the states and also the biggest flaw i see is thatplanes can fly over wallsof course it will be hard for people to illegally immigrate this way but it wont stop them
i believe immigration control shouldnt be a power the government has but i also believe the government should have no power so those things just go hand in hand
you want to solve immigrationits easy all you have to do ismake mexico great again
i feel bad for that women she was pressured by illegals to believe something false
tax them wtf if its that easy to go usa and live there all my relatives waste 25years and waste quarter of a million pesos to go there
youtube i have subscribed and set the notification bell to on why did i not get a notification
do  christ is lord change my mind
but people say weve wasted trillions on the drug war that is such an exaggeration weve spent more on the war on poverty in just one year and we spent on the drug war combined which i dont think the federal government should have anything to do with drugs or anything to do with anything except the military and boarder security but the war on drugs has not interfered with the war on poverty period
the second guy is a perfect example for why we need iq tests to vote
lets just put x rays all over the place to find illegal immigrants i dont know y this guy thinks that crimes are the only problem with illegal immigrants
what did i just watch
leroyhe reminds me of someone who has taken a lot of stimulants whether its cocaine or modafinil they both tend to have this sort of effect there is always the possibility of a simple manic episode but judging by his age rapid fire speech fasttwitchy movements and how he bounced around topics im going to say some foreign chemical is pumping through his bloodstream
the last guy wanted a big brother implant in everyone building a wall is less expensive and less intrusive cmon president trump get that wall built
the dude at 11 min wants to be governer and has literally never pondered 2 questions deep on the topicgtfo
democrat voters are literally bonafide domestic enemies aka liberal terrorists who pose an existential threat to our constitutional republic and must be liquidated by the millions go ahead change my mind
the sad thing is the dude that pronounces eventhingah like thisah is the only liberal with an solution despite how scifi and ass backwards it sounds
oh right the xray gate ffs
scientifical
i prefer these change my minds on the university campuses cause some of these people you interview are straight stupid
507and im personally not mexican im spanish and my family has been in new mexico since the 1550s lol
an xray gate yea am xray some type of ray a boarder yeah   jesus
i feel like the first lady didnt know what she was talking about
the dude in the white shirt watches way too much scifi
all illegal immigrants commit a crime its in the name
i think the dude meant sensor not xray not a terrible idea in theory but i dont think its doable also he doesnt want to restrict immigration at all which is a bad idea for democracy if you think your country is in the top 50 of countries
anyone who says the word libtard is retarded change my mind
the one guy wanted to be the governor of new mexico and is the most misinformed person i have ever seen
stevencrowder veritasium just posted an awesome mini autobiography and im happy for him its always good to see someone succeed in life guntubers might not see the same happy ending this is an 11 minute autobiography of his success with youtubehttpsyoutubes1tft4smd6ethis is what i posted in the comment sectionve i enjoyed your mini autobiography and i liked your story perhaps you can help with something not sure how empathetic you are but i want you to imagine your story with 2 changeschange 1 substitute physics with guns gear and ammochange 2 youtube turned against you demonetized most of your videos and basically turned you from a successful youtuber into an ebeggarwill you help your fellow youtubers i honestly feel that since anyone with i think its 50000 a certain number of subscribers are now considered a partner you guys should unionize imagine if all the partners either joined the screen actors guild or started your own union how much better it would be for the viewer with less censorship instead of youtube being a monopolistic autocracy over video content the terms of service agreement could be negotiated through collective bargainingfrom what ive seen youtubers are supposed to be like a big family i think its time that instead of ignoring the injustices happening to some of you guys brothers and sisters instead you could support themhow long do you think it would take for youtube to come to the table if all of the partners went on strike
damn these people are really dumb
the hispanic must have been stoned out of his fucking mind
100 of the illegal immigrants are criminals  they broke the law coming here illegally
crowders face at 1317 is my face during the last interview
hit second guest is an idiot
like if kd ruined the xray border
the look at the very endhilarious 
steven i have a whole new level of respect for you after this interview i dont know how you maintained your composure after xray border
this spanish guy is an idiot  you make no sense  maybe before you disagree with this topic you might want to do a little research
that guy was an idiot
the young man syfy way of bringing people in could all still be done with the border wall but they could also just have the freedom to choose to not do his way and still do it illegally if there is no wall thats not a rejection against the wall thats just an ideal situation where everyone behaves perfectly can you just trust them which aint going to happen lol
that spanish guy is a illuminati dream he wants everyone chipped he will bring in the nwo freely were fucking doomed
building a wall wont change anything drugs are still going to come in illegals are going to keep crossing no matter what because when your coming from a place where they are extorting you for money raping your daughters a chance of freedom doesnt seem that bad they pay american citizens to bring the drugs over because border patrol agents dont look twice
that final stare haha
that fool with the backpack is talking about chipping people
cop xray thing gate that scans where you are what
borders will become a thing of the past l m a o  nah playa not in our lifetimes xray border ahahahaha dying here so what hes saying is that the mexicans should fill out a field trip permission slip before crossing the border after being xrayed fkn brilliant
the build the wall segment wasted everyones time
im amazed you kept a straight face through leroys rambling wow
what the shit hahaha
crowder brought his a game this was amazing 
the last guy is the male equivalent of the girl you wished you hadnt started a conversation with at a party on snl
post interviews with smarter people your live change my mind video was the best all of the interviews were unedited
im all for immigration reform but i dont think that building a wall is the most effective or cost effective way to do so most illegal immigrants arent sneaking across the border theyre coming in here legally and choosing not to leave
being gay is a sinchange my mind
 yes lets xray them and shoot them with electronic tags yes i like this planwe can just have the military snipers in choppers shoot tags as  herds of illegals come across the open land yeeeee haaaaaaa boys tag um and bag um now all we need is the beast to sign off on the contract to get this system started
that lad you were talking to is as mad as a bag of cats and a retard to boot
1055dont do meth
707 really explains this guy has a criminal motive
2 things from me first the largest drug dealer in the world is the cia 2nd the wall will make it far easier to control the border and like it or not until every american has a job and is secure financially then we dont need anymore people in this country there are enough problems here as is
leroys about equivalent to the guy ringing the bell outside the salvation army  he said he wants to run for office just great another hank johnson no thanks ya retard
that guy has no clue what he is talking about
its to expensive
build the wall with your ass bitch brilliant the great minds of austin california
its a straw man to say that people who want the rule of law want to break up familiesits hypocritical to say you care about breaking up families and children and also support abortion and its stupid to blame trumpthese were existing laws that trump neither proposed nor passed and he has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate policy
that leeroy guy made me cringe so many times my wife is a proud american of mexican ethnicity and she tells me people like this leeroy guy claim to be spanish when they are obviously mexican as a way of trying to portray themselves as better than mexicans it is in fact a form of racism
if they spend money in the us they are paying taxes  bad argument steven
your face at the end says it all
fetal alcohol syndrome is a bitch
wow that gentlemans ancestors were in new mexico 50 years before new spain colonized ithot damn
honestly people arent afraid of regulating the border theyre afraid of being locked out of the country they call home the wall seems more of an intimidation than a regulation and trump supporters believe that a wall is gonna get rid of the immigrants and give them more jobs this isnt the case a lot of our lower pay work force comes from hard working immigrants i personally believe they deserve more pay and with civil wars going on all over the world and people trying to escape it its a given people are gonna turn to the country that promise freedom inalienable rights and equality for everyone america is a developed nation and were expected to perform like one yet for some reason were lacking in a lot of areas until we improve in these areas well were gonna lose respect as a nation
circumcision change my mind
never mind steven is dialing it back now and being kinder he mustve read my comments is why
low iqs on this one just build the wall already no more debate or conversation just build it
i farted
your future governor new mexico
build the wall
1317 uhh yeah thats kinda where im at too
im a conservative and i oppose the wall it will be a waste of tax payer money and will also harm the ecosystems along the border am i the only one that feels this way i want there to be background checks at the border but i dont think building a wall will help anything
build the xray border
either you caught it or your dumb as a brick great job crowder and staff i dont want to leave not gay jared  out a it oh and btw canada sucks lol
the guy in the white shirt needs to lay off the pot man
not to be mean but that second guy is not the brightest
all these people are trying to do is make a better life for themselves and there kids why cant you people see that it breaks my heart
i hope the guy with the camera watched this and saw how stupid he sounds
wow the last guy made himself look really stupid
just because people say build the wall doesnt mean they are against illegal immigration it means they want a more secure america stop possible crime and terrorism from coming in
i was surprised by your balls of steel
face palmed when he said xray border
hahahaha he is talking about gps inplant with all the information to keep track on who you are i think he is being brain washed by some type of electromagnet wavelength thingy saw some video on it the other day dont remember the namea conspiracy theorist would say he is a illuminati puppet project
lol i actually found the second guy to be refreshing in the way he conducted himself no hate no selfrighteous indignation just conversing like a civilized person with a peculiar joie de vivre and that first woman was hilarious
keep showing guys like that and we wont have to build a wall  i think the future governor was stizoned
this guy came to talk to steven right after watching futurama
you think maybe he was thinking a weaponized tesla coil from red alert
its fair if the us wants to build a wall its stupid if they really wanna force another government to do it mexico needs to get their shit together but they cant prevent all of their people from leaving even if they tried that being said the us still has the power to deport so they can keep that up too
steve i think you need a better holster because youre printing big time
if hes been thinking about this a lot for the past three years he should probably know the difference between xray and rfid
that dude had no logic tax the people who work for cash wtf
his face at the endim dead
the 2nd guy is most likely a live streamer who streams while walking around on the street
cleveland indians ht two thumbs up 
free flowing scientifical xray gate i finally understand what every other country thought when they heard that trump running for president  good luck with your future senator new mexico
god the way he over pronounces words gives me aids
want the effects the wall would bringbut not the actual wall
saw a crtv ad
the dude with the white shirt is polite but he is dumbyou cant reason with someone that fucked up bless stevens heart for entertaining this idiot
youseff merked you in that debate youre still great tho 
i was already giggling all throughout the 2nd conversation and that look at the end just made me burst out laughing that is one strange dude
it seems like steven is kind of expecting some of these young people off the street to be experts in their not being jerks and saying hes wrong or stupid its ok to ask how you expect us plan to work but its just in a way that sounding so frustrated and its not necessary youre not going to have conversations with experts on the street most people and i mean like everybody i know is pretty stupid about politics lol
potus should just start a fundraiser they could fund the big beautiful wall through donations
its actually really really nice to see people on whatever side of the political spectrum just talk level headed some people just cant see the other side and shout out insults
sigh i feel bad for this guy  everything hes said is basically what were currently doing and the stuff he mentioned that would be future tech is stuff that majority of people are severely against even if theyre just visiting family members in our country for a few daysweeksthe tracking where the persons go that is  and an xray borderi realize it would be xrays or any kind ie gammabetaetc but something that scans the whole border all the time for people would be extremely expensivedefinitely more than a wall and you then also need to get other nations like mexico who dont have the same kind of capital or authority over their citizens to make them take in whatever it is that these border scanners would scan
illegals send all money back to mexico and live 64 deep in 2 bed room house
xray border this dude is onto something
that last guy is fighting his own personal drug war and he is losing
the lady offered a nice and respectful discussion and ended up learning from it
i cant believe this dude is proposing a more invasive procedure which is highly unethical by the way as opposed to simply having border security and making it easier for immigrants to be led on a path to citizenship just wow what a mastermind as he says and wait he wants to be a governor dear lord
i want another one of this topic lol
its not a good convo when the people youre debating arent as knowledgeable
i dont like trump but i dont hate him neither hes just idk to me im not a liberal or a republican i just try to see things in a full picture while people who take sides only see a fraction of it meaning theyre ignorant
bro arent you afraid of getting ran over by some leftist maniac when doing these bits
how do they know how many illegals commit crime when they are undocumented you cant even establish an average you dont know how many there are how can you establish an average when you dont have the full numbers im sorry but those statistics are ridiculous if someone lives in an oppressive country  and they cant migrate legally they will risk doing it illegally because the risk is worth a better life
race does not matter change my mind
i watch these videos hoping for actual debate and im always disappointed  why  because steven crowder is a disingenuous hack  for him to do serious research put together a binder of facts and statistics that hes gathered and just generally have the job he does and then go toetotoe with some rando on the street is pathetic  its like taking a boxer even an amateur political boxer like steven crowder and have them train for a month and then fight some rando on the street  people would be disgusted in the show much like im disgusted in these interviews  how about inviting someone who knows their shit to come and debate you  the only people who steven crowder is convincing with these videos are people who already are fellow ideologues who sign on to his bullshit
this leeroy just fucked it for the rest of us lol what in the hell was he saying
leroy you are the dumbest motherfucker on the planet  we need to start securing our borders by eradicating idiots like this dipshit  unfortunately theres too many of these idiots running around the us with the same mentality just ruining the country  smh
how did crowder luck into the stupidest man on earth instead of making even a flawed argument about why the wall shouldnt be built this guy just sat down and invented the first illegal immigrant scifi fan fiction
we need a few mastermindsi wonder what he considers a mastermind maybe a fifth grader
build the wall but dont forget that big beautiful door
nobody wants to build an actual wall its stricter policies that trump wants i dont like trump i dont want children in cages but the wall isnt that fucked up at least from what ive read but the kids in cages thing kind of undercuts everything about him
so basically that guy is asking for something like drones along the border
building a wall is dumb and expensive control immigration through stricter visa processes and deport any illegal immigrant immediately and for the mexicans coming through the southern border just xray tag them the radiation would force them to call 911 eventually
i never supported the wall i wanted an electric fence with sentry guns and sensors to detect tunnlers and armed response teams when a tunnel is foundi also think we should keep track of everyone who comes into the country for a limited time and if they dont leave before their assigned date we put a warrent out for them with strict punishments for attempting to stay longer than allowed also we need to make the process of becoming a citizen more attractive if its more difficult to follow the law than break it nobody will follow it
ive asked this before but can you please link your statistical sources im trying to argue with people and its a pita finding this stuff and a lot of wasted time and effort if youve already done that work
show me a 10 foot wall and i will show you an 11 foot ladder i see the wall as a waste of money generally because there are far too many ways around it reform is a good idea but i dont see the purpose to the wall beyond ostracizing mexico
1315 lmao
these people have an extremely low iq next time try to find some normal people this was hard to watch
1315 omf that look said a thousand words haha 
this guy cant really be that stupid surely must be trollingi dont want a brick wall lets just tag everyone and set up a rfid wall so we can tax them thats much bettersomeones been watching too much scifi without knowing anything about tech or human rights he said xray wall for fks sake my paraphrase actually made him sound smarter than he was
im not so big on the idea of building a wall i mean whos going to pay for it might it not be cheaper for border patrol to just step up their game maybe the real problem has been too much leniency to begin with
steven you need to blur her id tag
we could fix immigration just by making legal immigration quick and easy for those who can be easily verified as having no serious criminal history while also increasing the number of immigrants we currently accept  the result would be far fewer illegal border crossings because the good immigrants wouldnt go through the hassle of crossing illegally if they knew they could just show an id and enter legally  this would also mean that anyone caught trying to enter illegally are likely doing something illegal and should be looked at more closely  its really ingenious in its simplicity wherein the good immigrants automatically separate themselves from the bad immigrants  in fact we might not even need a wall if a plan similar to this were implemented
luckily his border idea didnt involve gamma rays otherwise his company gogreen global would seem like a nefarious code name for a plan to turn people into the hulk
this conversation was pretty empty some fantastical and unrealistic ideas with little insight into why steven thinks a border is the necessary or an acceptable solution to illegal immigration
more intelligible guests are far more interesting this was hard to watch
im not american but i intend to be one day i applied for a research position and was successful i went through the required process and now im here as someone who has done things legally i find it quite annoying that people can just come in illegally and gain residency build the wall and bury seismic sensors along the full length of it to prevent tunneling at the same time get some of the older drones and use them to patrol the border they dont need to be armed just use them to guide border officers to anyone they pick up i fail to see what is wrong about securing the borders of ones country
leroy done did too many drugs lol
this episode was dookie shouldve been done on campus lol you wouldve got better conversation from those dreamers
i have an idea lets pull a dr evil and have sharks with laser beams to patrol the borders of our coaststhen lets make a laser beam that will go all the way from san diego tohelli dont knowfucking floridathen we will get every country to put implants in every citizen and just open the borders to allthat guys idea is the dumbest idea ever
steve blur the nametag change voice and black out body more liberals will end her  
the gentleman after the lady was funny lets not build a wall but lets microchip only way i see his xray plan being truely executable everyone even people not in our country because that will work im not exactly for the wall but that is just funny
100 of all illegal immigrants have committed  a crime they crossed illegally thats a crime
when conservative say the wall does it mean a literal physical wall or an anecdotal wall for tougher immigration policy
lol dude is so stupid
honey im going to illegally move to americaoh dont forget your electronic passport so the xray border tags you and so that you get taxed
that one guys a dumb ass uh
any country has the right to build the wall but dont make the neighbor mexico pay for it 
as a german who is old enough to remember a time when my country was divided by a wall i can tell you its just a bad idea in general and a waste of money to build a wall if youre really interested in this topic you might check on the internet for the berlin wall how strict border controls were people were shot on sight minefields etc and how it didnt stop people who really wanted to cross the border especially criminals have been incredible inventive when it came to smuggling goods drugs andor humans criminals and drug dealers will find a way around your wall and all youve done was wasting a big bunch of money
this is cringey
lmao did he seriously make this video what a fucking meme
like when hes asking what your statistics or you dont have to be sweet about it and say they arent my statics like that it makes you seem really un likable i just want to do see you do as well as possible
oh dear that dude was all over the place  but like liberals say about guns  more gun laws cuz if it saves one person its worth it  same with the wall no
borders are a thing of the pastuh youll be able to travel super fastuh
she said dont build the wall because they will get in one way or anotherwith that philosophy you should take your front door off because they will get in one way or anotherjust give up
the first ad i got here was called breaking barriers and talks about knocking down walls and spreading information and freedom probably completely random algorithm stuff yeah also those shorts man
this nigga be watching too many sci fi movies
this guy said his family has been here since the 1500s what was with his cholo accent
one cannot enforce illegals carrying documentation you can only have citizens have proof of citizenship the former they just loose the documents showing that they are illegal i have this argument with auditors all the time you cant prove a negative i cant prove that you are not a citizen only that one is based on documentation
censor more of the women in the beginning to help protect her identity
you need to invite shoe0nhead to a livestream and talk about feminism or something and maybe even debate on democratic socialism
x ray border lmao ya because fck deadly radiation right
deflection section whats your infection xray gatelet me check with my peops to see what i really think  and big pharma also made an appearance i was waiting on a rape culture cameo   future governor of new mexico folks
the guy at the 1000 minute mark wants to tag illegals like what the nazis did to the jews xddddd
421 kim jong un haircut
like the first girl said people will find a way around the wall i feel like instead of spending so much money on border patrol we could put that money into stopping immigration at the source by using it to help mexico become a better place so people dont have to immigrate into the us
i agree we need an x ray border
dont let this distract you from the fact that kid cudi felt it ok to release sb2h
450 would actually be legal not immigration lol
omg that dude is planning on being the governor of a state yowzas best of luck to new mexico and its current citizensemeli beltran im with you its always good to see a college liberal get butt hurt with righteous indignation and horrible arguments
wow so short this video was feed me more seymour
that was scary what that guy talked about it was orwellian were you have no borders and a electronic on you to tell where you are jezz thats creepy
drugsuhpastuhopiatesuh this kids accent made me want to punch his face
100 of illegal immigrants are committing a crime just saying
next time skip the tweekers
man steven youre kinda being douches to people in your videos now who arent being douches i love you and its not terribly bad but maybe dial it back until theyre a holes first its making the video tense and not like a conversation but a see how uncomfortable you can make them
im from new mexico im not voting for that guy
omg that pity clap and stevens face had me 
are those gray hairs in stevens sideburns
for those who wonder how trump could make mexico pay for the wall read if you wanna learn on day 1 promulgate a proposed rule regulation amending 31cfr 130121 to redefine applicable financial institutions to includemoney transfer companies like western union and redefine account to include wire transfers also include in the proposed rule a requirement that no alien may wire money outside of the united states unless the alienfirst provides a document establishing his lawful presence in the united states on day 2 mexico will immediately protest they receive approximately 24 billion a year in remittances from mexican nationals working in the united states the majority of that amount comes from illegal aliens it serves as de facto welfare for poor families in mexico there is no significant social safety net provided by the state in mexico on day 3 tell mexico that if the mexican government will contribute the funds needed to the united states to pay for the wall the trump administration will not promulgate the final rule and the regulation will not go into effect trade tariffs or enforcement of existing trade rules there is no doubt that mexico is engaging in unfair subsidy behavior that has eliminated thousands of us jobs and which we are obligated to respond to the impact of any tariffs on the price imports will be more than offset by the economic and income gains of increased production in the united states in addition to reven ue from any tariffs themselves mexico needs access to our markets much more than the reverse so we have all the leverage and will win the negotiation by definition if you have a large trade deficit with a nation it means they are selling far more to you than the reverse  thus they not you stand to lose from enforcing trade rules through tariffs as has been done to save many us industries in the past cancelling visas immigration is a privilege not a right mexico is totally dependent on the united states as a release valve for its own poverty  our approvals of hundreds of thousands of visas to their nationals every year is one of our greatest leverage points we also have leverage through business and tourist visas for important people in the mexican economy keep in mind the united states has already taken in 4x more migrants than any other country on planet earth producing lower wages and higher unemployment for our own citizens and recent migrants visa fees even a small increase in visa fees would pay for the wall this includes fees on border crossing cards of which more than 1 million are issued a year the bordercrossing card is also one of the greatest sources of illegal immigration into the united states via overstays mexico is also the single largest recipient of us green cards which confer a path to us citizenship again we have the leverage so mexico will back down conclusion mexico has taken advantage of us in another way as well gangs drug traffickers and cartels have freely exploited our open borders and committed vast numbers of crimes inside the united states the united states has borne the extraordinary daily cost of this criminal activity including the cost of trials and incarcerations not to mention the even greater human cost we have the moral high ground here and all the leverage it is time we use it in order to make america great againme remember the point of the wall isnt only to try and stop illegal immigration drugs etc but to slow it down and have a lot less of it people may be able to find a way in but it will be very hard
we might find areas where we disagree but we might find areas where we disagree
that ending look at the camera killed meall without xrays
it will be nice if you can add your references in the video description
build the wall with your ass bitch  burn
i dont usually comment but i just wanted the crowder crew to know that i appreciate the way that you encourage the open exchange of ideas through this series keep up the great work and thank you
xray border are you serious yeah theres no way to get around an xray right
a change my mind ad on change my mind video
every cent trump wants for the wall would be better spent on visa enforcement inside the borders its not that a wall wouldnt reduce illegal immigration it just wouldnt reduce it enough to justify the cost of building and maintaining it
that hispanic dude is way ahead of his time this nigga said an x ray border
she said money lending not laundering
super cheap international travel in the next 5 to 10 yearseven if multiple governments built an international highspeed railway it would be well over 5 to 10 years was he high i think he was high
what you will never have a free roaming of the world law
build the wall hahahahaha
you need to make sure her badge cannot be blown up and id be made if your intention of bleeping her face is identification purposes
wow my man just ditched leroy like a pro
the spanish guy from new mexico that has ancestors there dating back to the 1550sdudeyoure my family please dont make our people look bad
someone owes an illegal loan shark some money
build the damn wall
lol yeah i agree that leroy was lets put it not the smartest intellectual but many of these change my mind segments are unfair because steven has researched immensely and is very educated in the statistics of every subject and most ordinary people are not i just think in the future these change my mind segments should include people that are more educated in these specific topics for example a gender studies professor could try to change your mind about you thinking there are only 2 genders i personally do not agree with most of your viewpoints but i respect how you always keep things civilized and respectful you have changed my mind slightly on certain issues just some feedback for future change my minds
howd you keep a straight face through that delusional guy
xray machines huh hmmmmdude watches a little too much marvel
trump is not separating families change my mind
his face at the ends sums up that interview perfectly
this guy is basiclly wanted to give the mark of the beast like really 
the way that kid talked was like driving me like nutza
trump called immigrants and refugees smugglers and stuff while justifying his detention camps in which he put a bunch of immigrants in cages separating families from their childreni agree to the fact of watching over immigration still ironic the video gets released when these camps is being debated on
i got a donald trump ad on this video telling me to wish him happy birthday  what have u done crowder
congrats on 2 million subscribers steven so glad i found your channel big fan
i wish i could run into crowder when he has one of these change my mind segments i say this because he seems to  runs into a bunch of intellectual weaklings
homeboy would rather chip humans than build a wall class a brainwashed sheep
that poor woman we need to deport those illegal imigrants threatening the lives of our legal imigrants and citizens oh wait that would be racist sweetheart if you see this video or this comment know that while sanctuary cities may not be on your side there are people that are and dont believe in any of this crap lets start treating people equally and punishing them for the crimes they commit regardless of race thats what it means to be a equal society and a melting pot of cultures accountability
so basically that dudes alternative to a physical wall is basically tagging people like cattle and scanning them every time they go in and out of the country seems a lot more complicated and invasive than just building a damn wall and having several points of entry with manual review
xray border that requires an id scan so what you are saying is you want a wall
leeeerooyyyy trying to get id tags planted in peopleno boardersnwo
why not debate people who are knowledgeable and prepared on the topic rather than randos on the street who have no idea what theyre talking about
i find it funny how liberals are against trumps wall but will gladly take a trip all the way to huairou to visit the great wall of china and call it breathtaking
build the x ray border
the guy in the wall is legit retarded lol x ray border wtf
this guy answering the questions in the white shirt is a fucking moron maybe we can have cops riding super fast unicorns patrolling the border until it disappears in the next 510 years he plans on being the governor
i want to be the governor of new mexico doesnt believe in boarders wants to legalize and tax everyone want boarder controls admits that some people might not want to become legal and pay taxes takes both sides of an issue within one train of thought born politician
why was that hispanic guy so eager to sit down when he clearly has no idea on the subject
i have been waiting for this since 2016
these need to be at least an hour long man
god that one guy was so fucking stupid jesus christ holy fuck he needs his ass beaten change my mind
i dont agree with the wall for any reason other than i dont know what it would do to the ecosystem i wonder if it would displace animals or inhibit migration
the spanish guy has no clue tax illegals that have little money and get jobs under the table
when he said he would have to sit with masterminded individuals i just laughed1011
he wants them tagged like cattle 
imigrants dont go alone to other countries they bring their mindsetif the majority of us is venezuelan then venezuela it becomesthis is the shitholezation of a country
im against borders and walls and documenting immigrants but i want to make everyone pass a test and get a ss and a scanable card that registers them as they cross the nonexistent border so we know who is coming in and out    so what he is saying is build the wall its very scientifical  dont quit your day job moron
like scientificahand poop and boss hogs
how does this man attract so many retards
im like the first woman interviewed im all for the upholding of our immigration laws but not for building a wall for several reasons 1 the border of america goes through peoples backyards and private property will have to be siezed if a wall is built on the entire border 2 a wall is just not cost effective for anyone that uses the argument that we will just charge mexico for it when there is a new tax on something most of the time the tax gets put on the consumer trump can say that we will put tarrifs or charge them for the wall but it will be mostly be paid for my taxes of american citizens
xray border lmao
ive said too many times this idiot in office wants a wall  its not going to work why not instead the billions of dollars that hes asking for why not re enforce customs and border patrol agencies  recruit more personnel and better their equipment right there he would be killing two birds with one stone more jobs along the border in personnel in general make the border into an area 51
i honestly think if youll pay your taxes and you can speak a sufficient amount of english then youre smart enough to be a citizen the naturalization test should be just a bit more lax because i would bet a large amount of actual citizens couldnt pass it as it is now
im praying for new mexico if that shmuck ever becomes governor
youre a dick you blurred out her face but used her real voice and showed her entire body that defeats the purpose of blurring out her face if you dont modify her voice you think people who know her wont put 2 and 2 together even i could identify her with that from her voice to her weight down to her hair color and style down to the bag she carries and glasses she wears if she lived in a community i was in even with that blurred face i could tell who she was she told you about people in her complex and you still used her real voice even when she tried to mask what she was saying in order to not get hurt yet you still subliminally text out the things she was saying to you youre an asshole plus spending billions of dollars on a wall is idiotic when it was already proven that they use tunnels cargo containers and use boats to travel to mountain areas or certain areas in the us to get in use that money that was promised they would pay for yet apparently we cant use it to help out puerto rico hawaii flint michigan new orleans etc you know like actual us areas its like the priorities are all messed up next well build walls separating people by how much they make and what class they are in im not talking about gated communities but actual counties and districts thus preventing people who want to achieve more and get that dream job they wont be able to because of their class bracket itll be no different then ben affleck syfy show the incorporated or the tv series the colony being its already started with the class system we have now where urban schools receive way worse books and facilities yet manage to get drug stores liquor stores and gas stations with cartons of cigarettes and alcohol with processed foods pumped into ever other block where job opportunities are scarce and if a job reaches a quota on the amount of minorities they receive those even with degrees are left back to struggle within their own communities they worked hard to try to get out of now once you add a wall this wont effect just minorities this would infect all urban and middle class societies next certain hospital facilities will be restricted to a certain class of people and those without a higher tax bracket from a certain district wont receive the same medical treatment this happens already now yet watch it get worse this wall is a bad idea because it sends out the wrong message that we can disconnect ourselves from people by putting up a wall this will only lead into a chain reaction that ends up being implemented in our own soil which will lead to martial law this is the same reasons why they are pushing so hard for us to get rid of our guns first its our guns next its a ton of walls then its  robots fully taking over our jobs being its happening already then its martial law and a curfew machines like atlas ai like google duplex and openai will take over the work environment and secretary and office work your child will grow up being taken care of by robots like pepper from softbank call me a conspiracy theorist yet the moment humans who worked the assembly line got laid off for automated machines you got a robot speaking to you to set up a service or to track a package and no longer a human operator this is just one step closer with this wall to separate us from rallying together being even now people are being manipulated in different areas to think badly of certain areas that arent even as bad as they seem now picture once walls goes up everywhere this wall is a terrible idea which will be one of many on our own soil being we already signed and passed a law to kill and bomb us citizens and residents within our country i dont think people realize how bad of an idea this is  funny how all these shows and movies predict the same exact thing to which most of it is coming to fruition now its even highlighted in philip k dicks electric dreams 2017  kill all others episode being that is not that far from whats happening now
dude please give a warning if youre going to waste a whole video on a word vomiting person
usa is fucked
do you have any xray scanner shirts on lwccom ill take a shmedium tia
an xray border
building the wall seems like it would be ineffective and cost a lot of money but thats what i think
this is the problem eveyone wants to bitch but nobody  can come up with a better solution
americans arent idiots change my mind
govener of new mexico 
he had to have l e r o y  for a name huh   that fucker had me laughing so hard i burned my fried chicken and pinto beans
omfg that guy  what is comprehensionwhat is fiction 
building the wall would really fuck up animal migration and obviously mexico isnt going to pay for it but the american people will majority of the illegal immigrants migrate by over staying their visas and traveling by plane just to putting this out there mexico isnt the highest migrators anymore chinese and other latin american people are beating them by numbers
crowder for president 2020
but i dont want the walluhhits should be a freeform xray thing or something
once babies get microchipped at birth his xray border idea wont sound nearly as crazy as it does now
freeloaders  cheap pricks huh sounds like you are still cashing checksschmuck
i got an ad for crtv with a change my mind episode
crowders face at the end im dead
we cant keep everyone that crosses from mexico and nor should we unless they contribute to our society these other countries like mexico need to start trying to improve their quality of life for their own citizens theres no reason for the shit going on now on the flipside im for streamlining our current system a little bit like i said before we should be picky about who comes in and enforce our current laws on the mexican  border the wall is fine  with me then post border patrol in the areas between where the wall cant be built
the dooooooooooode 
i thought not gay jared and stevens wife were a liberal couple hanging around ready to interject their opinions when things got too triggering for like half the video lol
love the butthead face after the first guy lol
what the fuuuuu 3 of a particular demographic is responsible for 13 of homicides in the us bro holy shit thats not whats goin i mean do you expect us as a society to grab our ankles on this not happening anytime soon fam
xray boarder ok son did you do drugs beforehand
that first one wasnt fair   she was drunk
that one guys clearly doesnt understand anything about immigration and illegal immigrants
damn i wish i could speak to steven crowder about this topic he seems like a very reasonable guy i even subscribed to his channel because i appreciate the platform he created that allows for open civil discussion
the only technological thing that could come close to his imagination would be a sort of laser system lasers can project great distances detecting individuals crossing over the board possibly engineering a software that allows a 2d image being projected on a screen showing an outline of the individual with the outline it could possibly show the back packs for mules i dont think anything like that exist but that seems to be his image just slightly more put together and thought out but this still defeats the purpose of any sort of invisible detection system at the wall because there is still a need to detain the individual with no barrier it gives a chance of evasion from the officers
electronic id tag
im pretty sure illegals dont commit 37 of homicides where did you get that number because even if you take all hispanics in the us not just the illegal ones the number is lower than 37 unless nigerian and polish illegals are just massacring people
the big brother mentality personified make them do it and tag them with a micro chip if they dont wtf
they just debunked that immigrants commiting crimes stat on the news lol
i love how crowder has been sitting in the middle of the table for the past few videos lmao i wonder if thats a technique against the guest speakers
735 easy from a circus hes a clown
antiwallers have the big homogay
i think you should argue with someone at your level  these people dont have the knowledgeargumentation necessary for a productive talk
wow this kid is an abject moron who seems to think borders only exist in one place instead of across several thousand miles
that face at the end lmfaooo the brain is shook
crowders face at the end says it all 
that guy made all of man kind look dumb
im not for building a wall but damn some of these arguements are dumb as hell focus on yourself folks americans are idiots
im all for immigration reform its been a long time coming theres really 2 reasons i oppose the wall first is trump said mexico would pay for it not the american people second the wall trump likes looks like the berlin wall with the fat round top so its hard to get over i dont want no berlin wall honestly that dude wasnt very informed on the bored situation but one thing he was right on was eventually hopefully there will be no more borders its far from my lifetime but i do believe that being raised in a mixed family my sister is half black my mom was a single white mother both our fathers committed violent crimes and did time fatherless household lived on the system until my mother educated herself graduated from college an got her degree lived in cars trailers houses my life has had its hard moments ive always been told to vote for democrats i always did not really educating myself the older i got the one thing i hold as my standard in life is be accountable for youself being on the system as a child you understand that you work hard invest right diversify ur finances but whatever you do dont blame other people for your lack of effort pretty much im saying i agree w a lot of conservative views and values but the wall jus isnt one honest im okay with ice removing anyone who is here illegally thats committed a felony and changing standards for immigration enforcement i jus dont think the wall is the right answer i dont wanna pay for it it looks like the berlin wall and lets face it the money to maintain it keep it running would be staggering high and people are jus gonna find a way around it maybe even through it dont waste the money on that
i genuinely hope that man never becomes the governor of any state in the union
its too bad this video is so short i love watching these while i do homework which usually takes awhile
wow this was a hilarious video from a hilarious comedian
i like the shorts
my several ideas some good some bad1 just build the wall and have patrols daily and all that good jazz2 upgrade our surveillance  technology such as a very high tech cameras that can scan faces to see if their us civilians or nah also use special ground surveillance machines that send pulses into the ground and identify tunnels and stuff like that3 threaten to execution all illegal immigrants if they are found4 blow up the world5 cut mexico of from the us  with a giant saw6 line the border with a bunch of screeching liberals definitely will scare them offobviously several of these are satire this is a joke used to i wouldnt have to say that but in this day in age everything needs a disclaimer if ya dont want to get screwed by people
it seems to me that most of these people havent thought through their opinions just going off emotional arguments
please dont run for governor sir
i have a feeling that guy has had some contact with some of those drugs that are coming over the border
xray wall the greatest thing ive ever heard get this built right now
build it
how can people be this dumb
crazy to think how many ignorant people there are out there
just got a trump ad before the video
that last dude was something
bar code you mean a passport that document that americans use when they travel to other countries the legal way wow way to invent something that has already been in place for many years dare i say before you were born jose or whatever your name was i will call you dumbass
everyone for open borders should have citizenship revoked and deported open borders is war against nations and pure evil if we deport all illegals  socialists and cultural marxists the west would experience the greatest prosperity and freedom  nations are for patriots not traitors and invaders
so an xray border
i dont know what to think of that second guy
kid has add
he is not practical at all im a computer software engineer we still need a physical gateway and those id tags are already here in the form of government database its just more physical doesnt make sense the guy is just over the top stupid dumbfuck
steven i appreciate you crowder
an xray borderliterally the most cancerous idea ever
is that an ad wow
scientifical
i was waiting the entire final 6 minutes of this video for the glare of disbelief into the camera
sad turn out but the lady was really cool thats someone who is proud to be here and wants change however the wall should be built long ago people didnt like how easy it was for someone or something to get them when they slept they built walls problem minimized not solved but minimized humanly issues are never really solved see as we all are culturally different
crowder the guy that you spoke to he is mentally ill he is the type of person that is a ticking time bomb he needs some serious mental health hes going to either hurt himself or someone else possibly both
how about interviewing someone with an iq over 70
an xray borderwhy cant we just have freakin sharks with laser beams on their heads
the last guy described the beginnings of the mark of the beasttag everybody give them a number so when they walk through an xray machine automatically scans them and decides if they automatically belomg
ah ha ha ha do this again with more sit downs
like this if youre paying for the wall after you were told you were promised you werent
didnt get a notification
build that wall maga
that first lady is so fucking stupid lol
just tax em lol illegal aliens are the last people who pay their share of taxes
we will build the wall and then in a few years when the next dem takes office they will have it torn down waste of money im not against the idea of a wall i just think with the debt we have we should maybe just hire more boarder patrol or something else when the democrats tear it down they will call themselves liberators and convince their followers that they are heros
well im low on brain cells thanks to this video
950  the xray border thing and i was literally asking myself if i could really be hearing thisbut steven the totally confounded look on your face at the end made this worth it
2012 according to thre dea 93 of the cocaine manufactured in south america comes over the us border from mexico
yes  no wall but an unavoidable deathray along the borderand bull sharks with lasers in the rio grand   dr evil can build it for us
know when to shut the fuck up
cocaine is a helluva drug
we wouldnt have to come here in the first place if only you imperialists stayed the hell out of our affairs and allow us to build communism in our mexico
lmao what a moron
stevens thicc thighs give me life
america is going to become a shithole with no border
was that guy adding as to the end of words or was i hearing things
steve you had a crtv ad i down thumbed because it was hate speech of course but very cool
i agree with a lot of you views but this one is such a waste of money
man i would love to talk with you on this i believe i can chat with an opposite argument with you on this matter and have an agreement bummer im not in the states rn
i do like your show but please try to vet your participants and make sure they know how to speak fluently and intellengently before you set up a camera for them thank you
leroy for governor 20never lets make it happen people
scientifical
build the xray gate
this show gets more boring everytime i see it id rather watch ben shapiro
what is this guy on
maybe we could get bernie sanders input on this wall so it will be free
fuck you im not cheap im poor greedy littl
undocumented workers are 35 of the population and account for over 30 of the countries homicidesthat stat blew my mind
if anyone wants to know what marijuana does to people try and listen to the gentlemen in the white shirt that follows the first lady  its like listening to an 8 ball
xray border 2020 anyone
liberal building a wall wont stop illegal immigrants so why build itconservative gun laws wont stop criminals from buying guns so why make it harder for the law abidingsame liberal crickets
the wall is still a thing is mexico gonna pay for it
i personally think borders are important but wall seems like a waste of money
this human from another mother that isnt mine is that how you safely refer to another person nowadays is so stupid im sorry  oh yeah he would make a great governor of a us state 
i like the walther shirt
i did not know anyone could find someone dumber than your common progressive liberal yet it has been documented here
we need to build a wall on the canadian and mexican border time to stop all immigration
im still confused like you just want a wall to go from where to where i mean it sounds dumb to me
we dont borders or walls to enforce borders  suggests a border  try and fail to explain solution to a problem where a wall would be the solution     
i agree that protecting against illegal immigrants is important but that wall would be too expensive in my opinion i think maybe a couple mounted m50s every couple hundred yards would do the trick
drugsuh
lol you do not even have to think about it absolutely 100 of illegal immigrants commit crime the act of crossing the border illegally is a crime that is being committed by every single one of them
how you gonna put electronic tags on people who havent been to the country we gonna fly over mexico and drop rfid tags on them
that guy is definitely crazy but he genuinely seems to have thought about the issues on his own  much more admirable than the typical leftist ideologues
long sleeves dont go with shorts change my mind
the guy in the white shirt made my soul hurtalso i was hoping more people would try to argue the position
the wall is unrealistic the cost is too high and planes exist tunnels are a thing what about a rope
is stephen not wearing pants
haha this guy is going to run for governor of new mexico  sorry but even they are not that stupid
use the space force to drop moon missles on illegals
i plan on becoming the governor of new mexico  right buddy
he wants to run for governor
that cat wants rfid and open borders he hasnt thought that through at all
dude were you outside of a mental handicap place like that woman and that guy were completely incompetent i wouldnt even have posted this lol it would be like me going to a just people center for mentally handicapped people and arguing about capitalism these people were very slow
can someone tell me where the mastermind individuals are oh aisle three near the scientifical rays thanks gov
that guy is either really crazy as hell or high as fuck but i love his ideas he is thinking outside the box in a future method i can get behind but his head is in the future not the present
at 12 minutes my brain exploded
does nobody care about mexico as a country like how could they improve if all theyre able bodied people are crossing over the border is the end goal to just have them all move in and we just buy their land because they are incapable of improving
that last guy on drugs
if that guy became governor of bikini bottom we would be fucked
that first guy gave me a fucking migraine
building the wall would be a waste of a great amount of money and resorces for our country sience illegal inmigration its on a all time low and the majority of illegal inmigrants dont access the country through the border but by air
wtf when dude starts with the xray crap please end the back and forth hes obviously out of his mind
a country without borders is not a country
i like that dude he seems like a good guy
 fuck i hate when crowder just puts in these people with obviously no clue what theyre talking about i am sure you had people with actual points about a wall talk to them you dipshit intellectual
that guy is sooooooooooo high
those shorts youre wearing need to be deported
that guy is an idiot
i understand theres a time restriction and that you usually dont have much time yourselves but i would of love this video being longer but i still enjoy watching it and hope you go back to this again down the road 
that guy was beyond high or he was just suffering from retardation
that dude was on some of those smuggled drugswtf
meth is popular with him no
yeah lets build a big fucking wall our strained and ridiculous deficit can handle it its not like anyone in the past has built a great wall to keep people out its not like most illegals come here legally
the guy at 1055 is a wannabee elon musk he doesnt know what he is talking about but trying to sound like some silicon valley scientist fucking dumb fuck
he basically says makes us free to go where we want but monitored 247 by the government  with a chip like they put in your dogs so they dont get lost ffs
xray bordersmh this dumbass
that dumbass said oh im not mexican and my family came from spain and lived in mexico since dumbass youre fucking mexican idiot
well done for shooting down terrible arguments can you see how being intelligent yourself and talking to idiots about a topic might misrepresent the debate a one vs one with a star soccer player from italy against a player from under 18s from france isnt an accurate insight into which country is better at the sport
leroy is very scientifical
people are dumb
tip for governments make sure legal immigrants dont bring down the average iq like the guy in the white shirt does
that guy in the latter half of the video was probably on his way to buy a few baggies
toss those shorts out steven
my girlfriends twinsisters husband is about to be deported back to cocainville mexico he needs to take his damn kids with him
im knew to this whole scene but how are you going to tax people who arent here legally and you dont even know are in the country
417 lmao i feel like crowders wife new that dude was on something from the getgo
man that spanish guy is worse than trump i bet the government loves this guy
the majority of americans are not racist change my mindfeminism is not about equality change my mind islam isnt the religion of peace change my mind big government is a bad thing change my mind socialism always ends in starvation and genocide change my mind monogamy is a good thing change my mind abstinence is a good thing change my mindcomment wich one you would like to see
420 we might find some areas where we disagree and we might find some areas where we disagree probably a mistake but still very true
im glad crowder handled that situation with the legal mexicanamerican immigrant woman the way he did its honestly sad and it really brings truth to the argument for immigration reform when someone lives in the same complex as illegal aliens is so afraid to report crimes that she has to ask someone she didnt even know for help out of fear not that she would be deported but that the aliens would out her and force her to go on the run
good thing new mexico would never elect such a complete town to governor oh wait
lol wait steven you are a build the wall personi mean dude im all about better immigration policies and i believe in a metaphorical  wall but a physical wall is so dumb and a waste of money and wont accomplish anything lol physical wall  absolute autism strict penalties for illegal immigrants who commit felonies  good idea being deported and being caught a second time commuting a crime  minimum 15 years in prison make the stakes much higher for being a criminal that commits felonies in america and especially for multiple offenders like if we build a metaphorical wall it would be much more effective than building a concrete fence so many people come into the country legally and then stay illegally
when one hasnt been taught how to think and reason one doesnt readily submit for an interview 
that guy was definitely cringe my mind material xray ha ha ha
i feel the wall wouldnt be used to keep people out it would be used to keep us in
the wall is not the best approach i thing punish the employers heavily that way if they are no jobs no incentives to come  and the only reason they bring drugs its because of the low life addicts of heroin americans are
3 years spent thinking and he came up with xray borders lmao
god bless that first woman and you too for protecting her privacy
neocons push stupid ideas like walls and no path to citizenship but they will never go after the companies employing them because neocons dont care about imagration  they care about their rich donors stay woke
that guy was incredibly boring he wanted to speak to just for the sake of speaking didnt come across as intelligent or coherent at all
i agree with that dudelets put  it at disneyland too lol
if illegals were lawabiding people they wouldnt be here illegally  instead they cross the border and stick their middle finger up at our laws our people and immigrants who came here legally if that is their first act upon entering america what do you suspect they will do when encountering our other laws
an xray wall scanning people whom are marked with electric chipsa techno fascist who wants to give illegals cancer too what a terrible idea solving the illegal immigration problem by giving them a good blasting of a cancer beam is amusing and all but uh ill pass keep xrays in the hospitals
govener i hope not
hey this guy is the next governor of new mexico  you heard it on crowder first
illegal immigrants are a net gain on the gdp debate over
crowder please delete this video and cut out the lady with the purse would be a shame if she got found and executed because your video
lmao thanks for the content
so the guy who comes in around the 500 mark is against having a border but how would we enforce a chip or xray system 
cant believe these were the most interesting interviewers complete morons there is no hope for the western world
the last guy was retarded
me personally im kind of for and against it cause one you have border security but two its just this wall thats sitting there it just doesnt feel right to me i think if we have some sort of military presence there or something and reinforce our fences and have ground sensors if thats a thing
i had to stop watching this that dude has the most annoying voiceaccentwhatever the fuck how he was accentuating as at the end of words
yo this first dude is living in the year 3520
its out yes
that bloke was delusional
this was hilarious didnt get any half logical or mildly informative opinions out of these people but certainly got a few laughs
that one dude said aa at almost every other word
i was on the streets and dealt drugs for 17 years and yes the majority of the drugs come up from the mexican border like 90 percent the wall will help because much of the drugs comes up in backpacks lugged up by grunts who have to do it or the cartel will kill their mom
more bp agents would be a better investment i do believe the wall is a waste of tax dollars and the cost to maintain it boots on the ground is what makes a difference ive seen what theyve done to the few walls we currently have its a joke
i think the wall would be a waste of time and money do u think they dont have ladders in mexico or dig tunnels
hmm i kind of understand the idea of having an advanced technological border instead of the manmade version like for example you put one pillar at californias border and one pillar at the texas border and then you would have this like holographic field between the pillars so that anybody who goes through the holographic border without any access key it would notify the authorities your exact location as crossing the border illegally and the access key would be like a futuristic version of a passport you would have to buy that key at a checkpoint before crossing the holographic wall its more a scifi idea but who knows it might happen
that spainards been oppressing the mexican people for 500 years we dont need his racist guilt hear deport lee roy trouble i want a space force hat
is the guy for realhe really should sell his brain on ebayhe would make a fortunethat brain has never been used before
this guy sitting down with steven is on some type of drug
its getting to the point that i cant watch these
2nd guy had a half decent message with terrible execution xray border 
the monitoring wall could be an okay idea seeing as we can possibly send infared radiation waves from spacesattelite kind of idea down to the boarders to be aware of traffic besides that this guy is a moron
you need to blur her out more people can still make her out seriously
im a christian change my mind
beyonc a thot change my mind at least youd get lot of interviews and people would make better more coherent arguments than leroy here
this second dude had the most hilarious responses and i could not stop laughing masterminds xrays
umm so he wants to chip the immigrants like dogs he needs a little more than a few scientists to make that work lol
can we deport that dude for being such a dumbass
dont like videos like this get posted
i saw a post on instagram that children were being take from their parents at the border and out in cages does any one have any information on this also thought it would be an interesting topic for louder with crowder
not the best cmm 
i got an ad that was a clip of the last change my mind what
homosexuality is gaychange my mind
what percent commit crime uuuh 100 of them if they are illegal
the spanish dude or as he claims was just running his mouth without solutions or understanding the depth of the conversation complete libtard view of the situation with no logical or intelligent solution should have cut him off after the first minute and brought on someone that made sense
mr trujillo is the kind of representation their side gets alllllllllllll the credit in the world for  idiotic nonsensical rambling and the hilarious sense of false pride that follows i mean how do these people even function day to day  oh yeah welfare
this is against a wall but essentially wants to bar code them
that mexican is fucken stupid how can anyone be that dumb
this second guy you talked to was just a mess
the guy who is also recording himself and his idea of xray id idea comes from the arnold schwarzenegger film total recall
club mug
that poor ladys gonna go missing 
all races except whites have an ethnostate
people like that young man are a strong argument for competency testing for voters
im honored to have listened to the future governor of new mexico truly shocking and inspiring
i just feel like spending so much money on a wall will just be a waste i believe that the best way to stop immigration is to go to the source of it people are leaving harsh conditions of life from being in poverty gang violence and corrupt governments people are risking there lives for a better life for their kids if we go and try and fix all these problems in central america immigration would slow down a lot more then a wall but again thats my opinion
really a wall is pointless yes folks come via the rio grande but so many illegals come over from other means thusmore once that wall is constructed these illegal immigrants will utilize those other methodswe need harsher consequences for the businesses that employ illegals no money no good way of life they go back home
one thing you have to get straight between the parties when beginning this discussionyoure going to think its silly but its entirely necessaryis that you have to make sure that the antiwall party understands that there is a process for legal immigration i know it sounds dumb and that it cant be possible that many people dont know that curtailing illegal immigration doesnt mean no immigrants but thats where we are when someone says we need to stop illegal immigration all they hear is total xenophobia and therefore racism and theyve been conditioned to think racism is the worst thing that could possibly be
i just got an ad from the previous video u uploaded lol
lets number people and group them all up wait sounds a little third reichy
why would you want to build such a pointless piece of construcion it only burdens our citizens no other country is going to pay for it just millions more in debt
xrays are magic
that fake mexican just further proves crowders point on building the wall to prevent morons like him crossing to the states
how do you put the electronic chip in them this guy cant even follow his own idea
i wonder if hes referencing the dan aykroyd conehead movie catchem put a little chip in them if they come back over the border we have the xray boom
wow this dude is an idiot
this was really bad why would you even put this out these people cant even finish a thought wtf
the second guy thinks hes a genius lmao
shout out to the guy wearing the tyler junior college shirt
build the xray wall if anyone crosses without a chiptagid have a laserbeam destroy them
crowder is on steroids change my mind
building a wall would never work because businesses love using illegals for cheap labour as much ass they bitch and complain openly they love paying people under the table and not giving them benefits
this lady is a little of the rockers
cheap prick  the mug club is pretty expensive
congrats on 2 mil
how about no  build that wall
thank you for this short video im always busy and cant watch those 30minute or 50minute video
how can we truly tell the percentage of illegals commit other crimes we dont know how many there are
wtf  is the legalization of marijuana a good idea lol what a retard
lmao that first dude xd real smart cookie we have here
americans dont even want to pay taxes what makes the second guy think illegal immigrants are going to want to
the first woman sums it up extremely low intelligence constantly contradictory
wow that dude was all over the place so basically he wants to let illegals in the country and track them like animals how about not letting them in unless they come in legally in the first place that guy might want to get his shit straight before he runs for governor of new mexico
build the wall and deport all illegals
svencomputer is an ai change my mind
he just needs a few masterminds to plan it out and then bam he will have it   logic
boss hog
i had to laugh at the claim that the opiod crisis is anything but illicit drug trafficking the peak of illegalfraudulent prescriptions was in early 2010 the spike in opiod deaths via overdose didnt start until after daca was enacted with the last few years having ever increasing numbers of deaths the poppy fields in mexico have tripled in size since 2015 the amount of fentanyl and carfentanil being seized in the us has exploded in the last threee years but its the pharmaceutical companies maaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnn carfentanil is a strictly controlled substance the amount manufacturered for scientific use in the united states is 19 grams there have been pounds of this stuff seized in drug busts in the last few months it is being made in china and mexico and either shipped under surreptitious means mailed to canada via china and labelled as printer parts or trafficked via bipeds via mexico the cartels arent stupid theyre going to use whatever means necessary to get their customers hooked on as strong a stuff as possible to keep them buying if they die oh well the cartels pose a much greater risk to the us than radical islam imo
i strongly disagree to building the wall but i am in extreme favor of immigration reform
open borders is economical suicide
i feel like the second guy had half his brain cells killed by smoking too much pot
you blurred the first womans face but not her id badge around her neck lol
thats not my wallet  220
magically make them citizens for no reason other than they are here idiot i know immigrants who have gone through and passed the citizen test even they would laugh and feel insulted by some imaginary shit like this xray gate there is definitely intelligent latinos out therethey were not here today
ouchie that hurts my brain
we need a space force change my mind
wow that first dude was a moron so no dont build a wall but forcefully track sounds like a huge invasion of privacy
that second dude was on crack or plain tarded 
of all the change my mind videos this one has been the hardest yet to watch
bruh im pretty sure the chick from the last one is there
liberalism find a cure
worst change my mind ever
anyone have any footage of an actual wall being built yet id love to see it taxation is theft
so everyone should be tagged and monitored by satellites etc like rfid or gps chips
how do you stop illegal immigration just tax them like make illegal immigration legal immigration how stupid are you
mastermind individuals i cant 
steven im sorry you had to sit through that conversation
the guy with the camera makes my brain hurt
build a wall  go trump retards hahahahahahahahahah maga
the guy with the rucksack is out of his depth he really hasnt thought this through
scientifical is my new favorite word
its kind of sad that dude in the white shirt has some sort of show mosty because hes a fucking idiot
that dudes idea is scary for all of americans citizens and i feel terrible for that women i hope she was able to get the help she needed and stay safe in the process
that last guy was on adderall
cringe worthy interviews
i wish i could argue this point with crowder i personally disagree with the physical wall for multiple reason for one i think our tax money could be much better spent but the more important matter is the symbolic meaning of the wall building a wall along our southern border creates a certain tension that discourages people from entering the states legally it psychologically enforces an idea that mexican immigrants are not welcome in america this could and possibly would create even further tension between us and mexico its just not a decision i can bring myself to support now i do agree with the concept of immigration reform for the protection of american citizens but not in the form it seems that it will take when we discuss immigration reform we are more often than not speaking of either our southern border or immigrants from west asia i dont want to create a reform that is harsher on certain groups of people than they are on others this is because all people are equally capable of evil and isolating certain groups not only weakens the security of our country but also creates tension between us and the groups we are isolating this might be the longest comment ive ever posted on youtube lol
i feel like building the wall is a huge waste of moneyit doubt its gonna stop people from crossing the border illegally
why so short
water is wet change my mind
that lonely xray scanner on the boarder would be hilarious
you should cut the lady from the video completely you showing her even with a blurred face might put her in great danger
why is this the greatest country idiot  how about freedom individualism set of values way of life   yea lets just let em pour in so we can disappear as a nation and then make sure everyone is chipped so you can be monitored 24 hrs a day               dang thats dumb
sovereignty is literally the 1st thing required for a successful country nobody likes traffic lines not getting a job not making enough money not having enough stuff but they believe anyone in the world who wants to come has a right to enter the usa under that logic a homeless person has the right to enter your home morons breeding morons
the last person crowder spoke to kind of remind me of someone hmmmhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuagupzy2aa
i support tougher measures against illegal immigration for sure but i think the wall is overkill mainly because of the expense i want less government spending damnit
this poor guy does not know what in the hell he is talking about
start shooting them catch send them back right away mexico has a large southern wall
this wasnt productive at all obviously these people dont have any idea about what theyre talking about at least get someone on who can formulate a coherent thought and argument this video was just made to make people who dont agree with a wall look like ignorant fools
so we shouldnt have a border to keep track of people entering and leaving the country but we should have a machine keep track at the border that wouldnt exist and im sure people who are already breaking the law by entering illegally would totally just obey the law and make sure they got these id tags and stuff and they would definitely tell the truth when asked their reason for being there right sounds legit
the man went in with no plan leeeeeroooyyy
congrats on 2 million subs crowder dem caan stop yuh
second guy is an idiot
i want to build it stop hispanics from turning america into a 3rd world latino shit hole
that dude been watching too many science fiction movies
i think he wants to tag all humans with rfid tags and put rf transceivers around the city to track everyone at all times orwell would be proud
next time try to find someone with a higher iq to debate this guy is a flake
a wall or no wall doesnt stop internationalists from tipping their hats to foreigners anyhow the only reason they utilize the immigration system to vulcanize  nations  is because that chip is on the table foreigners coming to this country by the graces of rogue government it doesnt matter what the rules when our representatives dont even follow them to boot most foreigners come in here on visas and never leave
borders a thing of the past an x ray scanner wtf i look at the wall idea from a tactical standpoint cant the aliens just dig under it and it will cost billions of dollars but it will create lots of jobs tho for immigrants and aliens now how ironic is that they should of talked about how would a wall work im all for enforced borders but i dont think a wall will work
you should do trump is the bestor one of the best presidents weve ever had
white shirt was a retard lol
second guy was 100 on meth
and so like uh like were like a we need to just like uh let them in and tax them just taxm get like umm uh llke borders and like did i mention i want to be gov leroy rays man like the scientifical typearay that uh like could scan your kinda likeuh digital code manuh yeah brah  we call this kalifornia cognitive retardation syndrome and its finding its way into your neighborhood next lmao
theyre not sending their best
dude wants us to be chipped at birth to be tracked by the ai overlord in the future
new mexico isnt a city bud
we should all have rfid chip in our right hand or in our forehead to track us all lol
shoot to kill on sight with an armed guard every half mile on border just kill em
so the border will be lined with millions of precranked jackintheboxs right and everytime and illegal alien accidentally hits one it will cause a domino effect box after box will go off until it reaches the nearest ice checkpoint at that point the ice agents will get on their flying reindeer and swoop up the illegals with salsa powered portal guns which automatically transports them to the neareat detention facility im still ironing out the details i really need to bounce it off some other individuals but yeah thats basically how well fix it if you are an individual and have some ideas hit me up
i dont want a wall i want a more expensive technology that doesnt exist
god help new mexico if that dude becomes the governor
speaking as a professional pothead that kid was as high af
i mostly agree with the spanish dude any illegal aliens since theyre already in the country the government instead of wasting tax money rounding them up and deporting them might as well just get them to take some sort of qualifying course that initiates them into being an american citizen put them into the system get them paying taxes and putting money into the community and business this was probably horribly worded but yeah thats my thoughts
pretty sure the guy in white was on something
im not mexican im spanish my family have been there since 1550s  mate youre mexican  try migrating to spain  they aint gonna roll out the red carpet for their returning brother  when you live in a country it is your responsibility to adopt the customs of that country and regard yourself as a citizen of that country first  multiculturalism is a bad idea
yuplets just lojack all the people in the worldwhat a crazy plan
the guy in the white shirt sounds like when you have to do a book report on a book you didnt read
mass delusion is real thank god for president trump
colonize mexico  this bro said it himself they all want id numbers and to pay taxes  the panama canal would be much easier to patrol
i would like someone that is also an intellectual or is well versed on this topic to discuss it with you would make an amazing episode this one wasnt that great but still good
omg  was he high  scientifically 
i think everyone should have an id chip in america then my ph can let me know how long youve been in my country i am serious
ive been saying to build a canal or moat instead of a wall since the panama canal is getting old and is controlled by venesuella or columbia or something making a short cut through the rio grande would pay for its self and create more opportunity to export for both mexico and america
the second dude essentially just wants to tag these people like animals he watches way too much scifi
well there is a sense in which that answer is right there is a sense in which free immigration in the same sense in which we had it before 1914 is not possible todaywhy not because it is one thing to have free immigration to jobs it is another thing to have free immigration to welfare milton freidman
i dont care about the wall the real solution is to enforce laws that are already on the books that make it illegal to employ them
xray sensors  the great solution
i cant tell if that guy was stoned stupid or just another statistic of the public school system
maybe like the dude in this video is like a moron right
the wall its going to get border patrol officers killed we need a border a nice tall border
ur mom giey change my mind
youre my hero
to all of these anti wall people do you have a home do you have a main door where you enter your home then i hope you keep it open all the time so that strangers can come to your home every time they please sleep in your bed eat your food take your car for a ride and so on
crowder should try to attract a more intelligent class of opponents
adderall
why the fuck are you wasting your time with this idiot
fuck yeah finnally someone from sfnm hell yeah
i am all for the idea of the wall but putting in a physical wall on the border would cause a lot of controversy in america obviously illegal immigrants will always get in but instead of building a physical wall we should reinforce our borders and airports that lead into the country i believe that that would do more in terms of keeping the illegal immigrants out than it would with the wall and it would cause way less controversy
spay and neuter your socialist migrants
white shirt guy is retarded as shit sub 100 iq guaranteed
stop calling them illegal immigrants thats an oxymoron they didnt immigratetheyre illegal migrants
that last guy was a complete pillock
100 of illegal immigrants aliens what ever are criminals period 
hard oofs change my mind
these indoviduals prove why they dont have american values and they want the values and cultures of the countries they came from to be imported and over ride american values they probe time and time again why we need to stop even legal immigration to the west of people that are not part of our tribe its befoming a tribal war fare of 3rd world people into our tribes that refuse but pretend to assimilate and will never assimilate and proves why segregation of all people from each other is the only way in the end this world will ever survivem they only come here and survive because the ignorant welfare state and im tired of hearing how hard workint foreigners are if that were true then their country of origin would be more advanced then white countries becsuse they would have worked harder to build a better society our countries prive we are the hardest working people if we were less hard workint then others we would be the 3rd world and they would be the 1st world im tired of this narrative being pushed just csuse they clean and work in fields and landscaping we have our peoppe and technology to replace them they would of only been hslf way able to ssy thst if it was 1560 snd even then our people need work and work harder snr smarter the proofs in the production of our past before all immigration our lands had the highest produftion of the entire world that settles any argument ok so if illegal immigration is only going to get worse than that makes building the wall 100x more needed and important this right here confirms to me the real difference in race iq of people from different races of people these people are not wanting the wall soley just because it goes against trump and their butt hurt feelings bunch of morons that prove why we dont need any multiculturism or any diversity in our westen european countriesand drugs come alnost 100 percent imported from other countries ilegally they do not come from western countries they are illegal and dont grow in our lands much besides marijuana and mushrooms the rest if made in the west or grown have to almost all be indoor grown and pharmecutically made as in the middle eadt chija and mexico the poppy fields groe wilf in their much warmer lands without immigration and import of foreign goods in the west the drug epidemic would be almost non existant besides alcohol weed shrooms and some poppys can grow in small areas in our lands but almost all wouof have to be indoor grown and produced compated to warmer countries where these plants grow wild and domestic to their lands
i dont think the wall is need but definitely better patrolof the border depending on how the wall is going to paid for then idk i wouldnt want tax payer money for the wall gotta look formore into but to me the wall might be a waste of money wellfind out so far so good tho with what trump is doing maga
i got an ad for change my mind while im watching change my mind
the guy that escaped from the short bus needs to pipe down  go find his chaperone and put his helmet back on
the majority of illegal immigrants are from overstayed visas the border wall wouldnt fix that
there are much bigger problems at hand than illegal immigration my truth is that i dont want my tax dollars going into a big giant wall that wont serve as big of a purpose to the american people as perhaps the fixing of our fallen infrastructure our roads and the abhorrent state of our education system and now the child holding centers commiting the most inhumane acts eerily similar to the japanese internment camps in wwii its all bullshit im for immigration reform and i do believe we should be aware of who exactly comes in but the separation of families and a stupid wall is the absolutely wrong way to go about it
what the actual fuck was that guy at the end talking abouti lost brain cells
yeah i plan on being the governor of new mexico im a free flowing thinker so what if i turn up in mexico illegally what happens next can i get welfare in mexico free school and housing
why is that guy at the end ending his words like that sorry for the caps but it was so annoying
stevie your look at the end says it all
the first lady was nice but seemed ill informed
while i believe building the wall is most likely the only thing that can come to fruition in the current state of this country i do not think its the best solution the best solution is to take away the incentives that make immigrants believe the illegal way is the best way and enforce strict punishment for those who violate immigration laws good luck with that though nobody that i know says people shouldnt be able to migrate here they all just want them to do it legally lets be real its not like they havent had ample opportunity to achieve legal citizenship they either decided to use up their resources to do so elsewhere or were denied denials are usually for very good reasons some denials are in error but for the most part they are very ligit maybe we should just build all of our prisons along our borders then wed only have to guard one side of the prison and itd be killing two birds with one stone
i just dont think a wall is the right why to handle it i felt like this discussion wasnt even about the wall for the most part rather it was about illegal immigrants a wall would not be the best way to handle illegal immigration improve the border patrol and focus on fixing infrastructure the idea of a 1900 mile wall is pretty stupid to begin with especially since the government owns very little of the border to begin with
we might finds some areas where we disagree versus some areas where we disagreesteven crowder2018 
dude you should think before forming an opinion
he plans on being the governor of new mexico
654 r32 3 
i dont think you should build the wall because of how much money its going to be its not going finish in a long time trump wants security guards by the walls 247 so you have to pay them too and its going to effect the environment killing a lot of animals it just seems impossible
so basically this guy is advocating for the mark of the beast 666 via microchips or retina scanner like the movie minority report in essence lets take the rights away from all for the rights of a few undeserving a law that trumps another law bureaucracy runs deep with liberals
you cant build a wall to keep planes out do  trumps boarder wall with magic gate
how about invading mexico then down the line you have a smaller border and mexicans will get american citizenship 
he might not be the brightest person but i give the guy props for not yelling profanities as he walked by instead he actually took the time to sit down and talk with him in a respectful manner
i like these segments i just wish that some cometent people would talk to him id like to see steven debate a libertarian view of it
that mexican guy was dumb as a post  this is who we are importing as the voting mass  lord help us
lol i got an ad by your channel for the there are only 2 genders change my mind
i was at the local gas station here in open borders california  there was a young man a diamond tattoo over his eye walking around the gas station with a cigarette in his mouth  assaulting local citizens yelling out north side gangster bitch  literally bragging about having a strap  on the 4th i will listen to hours of gunshots  none of those by cletus and earl  fuck this shit  at least 40 million hispanics need to be deported
in theory the wall represents greater protection for the native population in america yeahin reality i think the process itll take to start physically building the wall will be more trouble than its worth unless its heavily militarized youll get protestors especially the violent kind who will do everything in their power to disruptwhy not invest the time and effort and money into building more secure border facilities
dude in the white tshirt is high as fuck wonder why he went straight to talking about drugs
1316 
shes walking around with a bottle of plant
i think that guy forgot to take his adderall
man im in 8th grade and we had a socratic seminar there were so many terrible points and irrelevant arguments but i have extreme anxiety so i kept it all to myself i wish you were there to teach them
i feel dumber having listened to these idiots
that was like watching lebron james play an 8th grader 1 on 1edit 90 upvotes in an hour im grateful boys
lol oh wow the triggering this video is going to do  its great
these people are complete morons and not worth a conversation i feel like i just wasted 1344 of my life holeee shit was that guy dumb and he was recording himself lol
this episode was such a mindfuck lol
dude was comical sound like he wants to chip everyone
i want stronger border securities but the wall so dumb lol too expensive and wont do anything at all its pointless
god help us
if you see or suspect illegal activity by illegal aliens here is the number to ice to report themreport crimes suspicious activity and suspected child exploitation of missing childrenby phone 1866dhs2ice 866 3472423 online tip form httpswwwicegovcontact
which was the part that you were surprised about and didnt know what to do with
the look on crowders face within the last few seconds was priceless welcome to the twilight zone 
the guy in the white shirt was either high on cocaine or drunk hahaha steven crowder had too much patience for that guy hahaha super cheap  super fast xray haha holy shit
omg this guy is the future  a 7 year old has more understanding of the world
wall gets build 2 years later mexico gets 1st 2nd and 3rd place in pole vault olympics
that second guy is fucking idiot im hispanic and i want that fucking built period
so basically put a chip in everyone sounds like a way for the government to monitor exactly where everyone is i thought we had freedoms again that kinda stuff lol
i dont know if that guy really has thought the consequences through all the way it sounds like such a system would be open borders but a worldwide surveillance state so basically both the us and mexico and likely other countries would need to develop some infrastructure and either implant chips into citizens at moment of birth or some other technology such as bar codes really good facial recognition or even xray skeletal fingerprinting etc in order to precisely identify an individual person and their location for the purposes of taxing the individual and if the taxes are not paid they can be quickly collected and punished as the local government sees fit these xray scanners would not just be stationed at the border they would be positioned throughout the entire country like cell phone towers yeah mandatory tracking of all citizens of every country in the world or am i misunderstanding and he just wants to do this to mexican citizens seems a tad more controversial than building a wall not to mention all of the other ramifications this would have on society the government would not be the only one that could intercept and track these signals ad agencies your boss your blind date that creepy guy next door they all would be able to track where you are and what you do every day    personally i have some libertarian leanings im not totally against the state or the concept of taxes i just think that any power we give the government should be limited and well thought out this kind of technology could still happen in a small government capitalist scenario but at least there the individuals are knowingly taking part and can back out at any time basically what cellphones are today this idea is so crazy orwellian it is hard to believe someone would come up with such an distopian plan unironically and he wants to be governor of new mexico
youre an absolute saint for sitting through this guys ramblings with a straight face
why so short  the last guy wants minority report
build the wall with your ass bitch could we see not gay jared in drag try to twerk his way into constructing a wall 3
yay controversy d
that last guy is on drugs wtf is he talking about
the glare at the end lol
cant wait for the scientifical xray border
go to bingcom its insane and you can see the migration period of 2015 in europe if you read this in the next coming days just click the back button to find the wallpaper thats for today
does anybody have a solution to the environmental impact that a border wall would have besides cost of construction and maintainence environmental impact is my biggest concern about the whole wall thing
i like how steven says his videos are in uneditedhe has to edit his videos now after what happened with usef
you should have set up at a home depot parking lot you wouldve had more people show
seemed like they were both high as shit to me but without a doubt they both dumb as shit
i feel bad for the xray border guy  im not entirely sure why
damn wish i couldve meet him on this topic to talk to him on this topic too
haha at the ending
leroy grammatically sounds like my 4yr old daughter make money off them by taxing them how fucking retarded is this clown
that last guy wow he dumb
no i will just walk around the xray scanner dumb ass
that first guy was annoying as fuck
xray border that reads your mind is better then a wall yeah whatever it is that leeroy has been smoking ill take that for a hundred bucks worth
that xray dude is a fucking idiot send him back
it literally hurt to listen to that guy try to justify the no wall positionsome people only feel that they dont want a border but refuse to accept the logic of its necessity they cant extrapolate how the lack of border control will actually end up taking away their ability to live freely as an american citizen
o this topic let me get comfortable lmaooo
muah ha ha 
thinking about being governor of new mexico  omg he is clueless xray border how you gonna get people to go to these xray gates if there is no wall to direct them there if there is no wall why would they bother going to a gate  utter insanity
this kid is a moron and basically advocated for a police state where the government knows your every movement
build the northern wall too
the guy is before a mastermind we need louder with crowder at byui
the main thing that ive heard in opposition to the wall is how it will apparently affect the climate and the ecosystem around where the wall is built as well as how trump presumably thinks that all mexicans are bad people so basically ive heard more people want to save the wilderness then protect our country
that spanish dude had to of been on drugs right
facts dont care about your feelings  change my mind
xray borders  is that guy actually retarded  like full on windowlickin helmetwearin chestbeating puddledroolin retarded
isis the last guy the antichrist
i just want to know if the person or persons that sit down to talk with steven if they get to keep the louder with crowder mug
the least interesting change my mind for me yet painful to listen to this guy
drug s
make more of these vids bruh
am i the only one who thinks this guy was high on somethin lol
my solution to illegals land mines
did spanish leroy seem very high to anybody else or is this just an example of stupidity activated and excitable cant tell anymore these days appears to be an epidemic
looking at any standards we need to build the wall period any other country that has walls are completely looked over but if us citizens want a long needed walla competent one we are looked upon as horrible people and racist im done with the left we need to push the wall initiative before its too late trump has another 25 years in office and needs to get ground broken most people have never spent time in a third world countryat the rate that illegal folk are pouring in we will becthird world in 20 years keep it up folk
well im a bad mexican american i dont know spanishfunny thing is both my grandparents very mexican so mexican my great grandma went to mexico to give birth to my grandma xd anywhore i dont have confidents in the wall i live about 15 mins away from the border but my goodness gracious great balls of fire that stops no criminal activity just makes criminals either smarter and more lethal now does that stop me from walking around the park  11pmno cause im bored and have no self preservation however i have sibling who i am concerned for and when im walking around the park and see group of people scatter like roaches trying to act normal 3 going into the monte 2 walk pass us 2 walk to another bench and 1 staying seated and 2 hinding in the shadows of the tree like a bunch of creeps and then watch us walk around like some fucking predators i get worried i wish my dog was still alive cause he was the definition of a rabid hell hound and i honestly dont remember a time being safer then when i had a dog that turned a trash bag of aluminum cans to confetti so fortify the wall sure but i once saw a video of someone climbing that shit like a monkey so good fucking luck criminals are the best at parcore  but till i move somewhere else get a gun or a new guard dogima carry a knife around and shank the first person who gets to kidnap me cause damn it i know when someone is planning something and i sure as hell aint gonna be taken without a fightstay safe people exercise your 2nd amendment it may verywell save your life
leroy i dont want a border wall just an invasive surveillance statehes probably a decent guy and i dont want to hate on him but he seriously does not understand the implications of what he is saying not only is he unwittingly designing his own border wall but he is also investing the state with far more power to oppress people through the destruction of privacy than he would probably be comfortable with
i got a crtv ad on louder with crowder
what a idiot i feel for that lady
the physical wall as currently suggested is dumb imo you get to a point where youll get diminishing returns after a certain size and it will need personnel to enforce it irregardless id prefer to see border enforcement though more modest fences in key areas personnel and increased surveillance though drones etc
we need einstein and stephen hawking to figure out the concept of a border without calling it a border
as a mexican living in mexico i say build the wall we shouldnt care as long as it stays on your side of the fence and doesnt   cost us a cent and for deportation sure deport just make it so we know who is coming over not just let them at the boarder there has to be communication between the countries in that aspect  and remember not all latinos are mexicans send them to their countries and also not al mexicans are from baja california
open border democrats
sure build your silly little wall time to invest in some mexican drone companies and ladders
didnt even get a  notification for this video
i didnt know weed was legal in austin 
they arent sending their best
my heart goes out to that woman the first one
when you have a guy like xray man there is no possible way you can change their mind because they are too far gone all hope is lost its actually impossible
if this guy every becomes the governor of anything i will literally shit in my hand and eat it
poor woman i wouldve blurred her whole body not a fat joke because god forbid they see this and know her voice
i dont entirely agree on building on the actual wall but more of border defense
that zoom in at the end xd
i dont think a wall will prevent people from coming illegally from the southern border change my mind
finally
845 you have got to do a better job of detecting when you are debating a topic with someone on meth steven
him doesnt want a wallalso him wants a wall
and you wonder why the average iq in the us is falling
he is actually wearing the ranger panties thats really funny
my opinion as a mexican who lives in mexico is that you can build a wall as big as you want its your country and you can do whatever the hell you want in itthe thing is mexico is not paying for that wall gun trafficking from usa to mexico and central america is the root of drug trafficking cartels without guns or ammo wouldnt be able to operate nor hurt people which is a cause why they cross the border to find a safer place to livealso dont call immigrants mexicans because most of them are not mexican but from central america
truly feel bad for that lady  theres so much of that going on in fall river ma right now too
cheap pricks woooot
i like to think of myself as a freeloading cheap prick
you know why drugs being brought in wouldnt change with a wall because its been more the proven that government agencies like the cia are paying cartels to bring the shit in a physical wall would be so stupid
then if you let them be citizens the democrats get free votes build the dam wall
love the face at the end
the mexican in the white is a big yikes from me
shouldve done a bigger blur on the lady bro youve put her life in danger
lmao that was painful to listen to in the most hilarious ways
bringing the drugsuhhh
scientifical  the word of the day folks
the wall is more than just a means of preventing people from coming in illegally it is a monument to americas will to survivethe fact of the matter is that this country was made by and for white people our founding fathers explicitly stated that they wanted america to only allow in free white people of good character even going so far as to ratify such an immigration policy in the first continental congress in 1790 a full year before we even had the bill of rights this leftist lie that america canada europe australia and new zealand ie white countries and only white countries are somehow meant to be for everybody is barely 50 years old and was introduced right around the time that leftists were taking over every american institution from academia the media the catholic church you name it in order to weaken the social fabric and thus make it more porous against policies like limitations on free speech gun rights and various other things that nonwhites are routinely againsti dont care how many crying brown people they put on television i dont care how many dead brown people they put on television  if theyre not my people then they are not my problem they do not belong here nor do we the people that are america gain anything from them being here they need us we dont need them because only we can be us
for the sake of that woman please only show audio she is afraid of what those illegal immigrants can do to her or her family i mean by her fear and intend to deport them probably means she lives close by those gangs they probably know her enough to recognize her despite the blurry faceat least i find it wrong for you to put what she said when she covers the mic she evidently is afraid the wtong people will hear her i am normally i  favor of your unediting policy but for the sake of her please change the video or at least do not write what she said
where does he buy his weed i need some of dat shit
that low iq fat mexican bitch in the beginning confirms my argument that these people should not be allowed in
fuck you can tell no one wanted to sit down with him cause he was stuck to use the interview with that idiot in the white shirt lol cant believe the big load of bullshit that flew out of that guys mouth lol
this guys advocating a massive police state
everything open boarder dude described already is in place hows that working
its better to put the milk in before the cereal change my mind
x ray border
oh my god please build the wall
so basically like a hitler style tattoo yea sounds real smart buddy
fucking hell leroys living in a world of hopes and dreams  or maybe just the 23rd century
yikes talk about the big brother on steroids that fuck is scary pinko scary shit stupid stupid stupid
that mexican excuse me spanish dude is smoking meth literally
it amazes me that someone that stupid is able to function in society im surprised that he can remember to breathe
that guy was a fucking idiot
hilarious the answer to illegal immigration is to legalize it no problem make all aliens citizens and there will be no more illegals problem solved its as if he does not know the real problems regarding the outcomes of too many illegals all at once
that final stare hahaha
xray border gate lmfaoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ironic as he was just saying no borders
i lost brain cells listening to this guy
good conversation he wasnt all there needs a bit to formulate an answer but a clear thinker and someone trying to find a good and reasonable outcome is good
only 13 minutes 
scientifical
i love that sweet mexican american  immigrant
that spanish guy is hilarious
heard alot of people had died from driveby yelling 57 died last year its really bad in california 2 in arkansas 3 in kentucky and 10 in delaware please help stop local drive by yelling by reporting your local police or your local fireman for any strange disturbance in your area
she took out a loan and is trying to get her loan shark deported lol
props to steven for not embarrassing those two volunteers you know he wanted to
the xray wall will be the biggest beautiful wall
his face at the end
i love that its a white male who steals from illegal mexican families on the vox video those fuckers are all about using diverse characters in everything unless its a criminal watch any home security system commercial and its a white dude trying to break in the house
steven is a pseudointellectual he never debates with real smart people
this issue is like a poster child of facts over feelings for these people i dont understand how someone can argue the security of any country i am just dumbfounded
did he just say scientifical
do all these anti wall idiots think it means a strait wall all the way down the border with no openings for people to go through seriously theyre idiots the second guy doesnt understand his entire idea wouldnt work with an open border for people to go through without anyone knowing
2 million  congratulations
i talked to open border types and when i bring up that mexico has a nice southern border they said that us is the land of the free and home of the brave so we should have an open border
all we need to do is annex mexico  all mexican citizens are now american citizens so much of the illegal immigration is solved and well have mexicos wall now be a wall on the southern border of the united states  then trump gets to claim victory in solving illegal immigration and fulfilling his promise for a border wall which mexico paid for
when you realize many people around you are as fucking retarded as the guy with the white shitgovernor of new mexico pppfftt
cant believe that guy got claps at the end
hat off to you steven for not bursting out and laughing at the x ray thing 
wow that guy is a moron
wow is it really that hard to find intelegent people to debate maybe u should try doing this on a college campus
build that wall
what surprised me the most maybe the fact that you arent wearing any pants
lol that guy is self contradictingdont keep them out or deport them but make them register and pay taxes thousands will volunteer and sign up to be tagged and then have to pay taxes sure makes sense 
santa fe is screwed
i speak to actual insane and deranged people a lot because of work he souns just like them i think it could just be a combination of ignorance leading to wild speculative statements and a rather low iq cognitive dissonance and incoherent training you have my sympathy steven though it was bound to happen
here is my argument against building the wall invade mexico instead and declare them a tributary to the new american empire
if youre against building a wallbecause you dont think it will prevent people from getting inand against illegal immigration then why not build the wall anyway if only to shut up the people who do  of course if what she said was true then her only other reason to oppose the wall would be on the basis of cost but how could that be true given the fact that nearly all people who oppose the wall are democrats because its now painfully obvious that democrats no longer give a shit about wasting money  its doubletalk logic like this that just proves that opposing the wall is nothing more than political posturingwhether the people who are posturing know it or not
stevencrowder  how did you not just bust out laughing at the guy describing the xray border which is still a border even though he said hes against borders
cant they just dig a hole under th wall to the other side
stephen crowder youre a libtard
omg  free flowing xray border id have to talk to  i dunno smart people cuz like uhm i plan on being the governor of new mexico well new new mexico  and weve been wasting thousanmilliontrillions of dollars   this guy is proof of the reason we need a wall
i dont understand how anyone can watch the portion with that spanish guy it felt like my iq went to zero after watching a portion of him speaking
that proposition of something which is essentially a tracking device
this guy is soooo fucking moronic hes literally saying they need to come through a check point but doesnt want a wall
just combine all the worlds governments no more national debt suffering people become everybodys problem no more disputes between land scientist can share research freely  to advance societyim not talking about conquering that would just cause revolts
that second guy
omg that guy from go green local was a complete idiot he wants to id tag people and have scanners on our border and throughout cities to track where people are that is somehow better than a wall thats a million times more invasive listening to that guy dropped my iq by ten points
did this guy smoke a fist full of meth before he sat down
hea so retardedm that guy wtf is this back to the future
so we need to microchip mexicans and funnel them into xray machines instead of asking them to fill out some paperwork
you should have blurred her whole body
another contradictory view of mr crowder claims to be in favor of property rights and free markets yet wants tp restrict the free market crowder again i offer a debate
only the top 20 of earners are net tax payers so unless these illegals are all making 100k a year then no were not making any money off them
wow that dude just wanted attention because he likes the sound of his own voice what a bunch of double talking nonsense he must think that if he talks enough eventually something will make sense lol
we have too much people flowing in from the south and california isnt doing a good enough job keepinem out do california a favor and build the wall
as much as a get a laugh of off idiots it make me want natural selection to effect humans more
love the show and i am one of those free loading cheap pricks but i watch share and suggest lwc all the time so if i have turned at least one person on to you to be a fani think ive done my job and support 
500 that guy is as spanish as antonio banderas is mexican
that last dude was on drugsmaybe he was transporting drugs oo
not being a libtard but has he ever changed his mind
x ray border lol
the look on your face at the end priceless your expression was exactly how i felt listening to this guy lmao i wonder if that sponsor of his knows that they have a complete and utter fool representing them
love these videos please keep making more
lmao dude watches way to much tv
had an ad for lwc on this video hmmm
when it comes to the drug warweve been wasting thousandsmillionstrillions of dollarsthis guy was just rambling his ass off
the guy was more like noventaizo because he was like 90 native and 10 spanish if that but totally 100 retarded
cant wait for leo to be gov of nm priceless
i was waitiing for that look at the end lol how did he keep a straight face for that convo lol
why does t he mexican sound korean 
as cringe as these segments are its always great seeing the tolerant left flipping out over different opinions
im pro stricter immigration laws that being said i dont think a wall will stop as many people as a lot of americans think a lot of people come over on planes and simply overstay their visas not to mention if you build a wall it will just make people find a way over or under that wall a lot of people already come in through our check points by getting smuggled in its kind of the luck of the draw when they do it that way  but i dont believe that the majority of illegals are walking across the border for those reasons i think the wall would be a huge waste of money if a democrat gets into office after trump they will just stop construction on the wall or have it torn down so it will be a huge waste of money that could be used in a lot of other ways to benefit this country education infrastructure etc
steventhats a tweaker trust me that dude just got spun up
lol  spanish my ass hes mexican
i had to leave this  interview   1100 this pendejo is well a pendejo
i saw the notification for this video and was like holy crap this is going to be epic but then the guy came on and starting talking about xray vision borders and crap and i lost a little faith in humanity
ill have whatever he smoking lol
i usually agree with all of your change my mind topic but not this one i feel like money could go towards better things instead of a giant wall that wont change much
that dude is on something illegal
xray border bruh im dead this guy was high asf lmao
ask her what job she has and illegals keep coming that by definition will compress wagesmeaning the job you currently hv you will hv a awful time getting that raisebecause an over supply of labour means employerswill hv the option to say goodbye to youwhybecause i hv many others from out of country who will do your job for way lessand lower or no benefitsits simple math
build the wall is my cod ww2 emblem haha
his free thought is essentially him just talking out of his ass
as a native new mexican born and raised as a norteno this dude does not speak for or the majority of this state sante fe and albuquerque are democratic cess pools full of ignorant people like this gentlemen this guy cant even formulate his thoughts on the subject or reflect on what he is talking about he is basically talking about a system similar to the nazis system used to track jews
building a wall wont do any good they will just tunnelclimbswim over wont stop illegal immigration and i have doubts it will even slow it down that money is better spent on other things
the sooner we build the wall the sooner we stop retards like that last guy from entering the country
both of the ppl he spoke to were absolutely nuts
i dont know what the proper scientifical word is  facepalm
hearing the second guy gets me so fucking  pissedthe stupid shit that guy says just makes me so angry i fucking hate it when people are that stupid and just saying shit that aint true
never clicked on a video so fast
yes sir
i think the guy in the white shirt genuinely has autism
his answer is to give illegal immigrants a heavy dose of radiation poisoning as they cross the border with a powerful x ray machine to scan them
there is a process to become a citizen people just dont want to do it
that guy talked a lot and didnt really say to much that he didnt contradict in his next sentence   wow
too hard to watch people that stupid
its hilarious ignorant and sad as hell how they all have opinions about the wall yet it seems only the creme of the crop were willing to talk about it lol   kidding the first lady is simply a dumbass who has 0 clue what the hell shes talking about same with the second sadlythird times a charm  aweno third time   steven this is an excellent topic on which to help educate others sovereignty the law and the constitution and also to dispel their many indoctrinated ignorance concerning all three     round two stevenmake it so      a for effort buddy
leroy been watching a lot of netflix recently huh
wouldnt a mine field be cheaper
hahha this guy was like no no borders but like areas that scan you with this pass code well then with no border i dont think that will work hahaha boi just build a wall
1316 i got the same exact look
what percentage of illegal immigrants commit crimes well lets see all of them they are illegal
statistics are offensive to liberals change my mind 
leroy is full of shit
i zoned out after he said scientifical lol
i have no clue why women would be against building a wall they all know by their mid to late 30s theyll slam face first into one youd think theyd be happy that other people are hitting a wall toowhen the fuck are these fuckin morons going to realize nobody is against immagration or immagrants who go through the process we do not want the ones here illegally crime its a total dick slap in the face to those who followed the law went through the process and waited their time to become citizens of this country
510 years no borders ahhh i dont think so dude maybe 50100 years there will be something weird going on but not 510 years and this dude is way high  i need to sit down with the masterminds okay brah lol
with frickin laser beams on their heads
i thought the future governor was going to shoot steven at the end the crazy mofookah described an electronic version of immigration enforcement without punishment of course
if any stranger came onto my property without permission id call it a possible threat  the wall is a great security idea and will discourage people from taking the risky journey
the reason you had so few participants is because they cant defend illegal immigration  they can talk about everything but the fact they are entering this country illegally and that is wrong  and too damn bad that trump doesnt hold their hand while they are stealing from our country  make everify the law of the land fingerprint everyone and deport those that are here illegally
yes build wall from yugoslavia
the ending
you need to do a video on an american citizen trying to go to canada without a passport or illegally i would like to see how they treat that person
fuck u we dont ned a wal we nede mexicons to halp wit our contry becase trump is fucking it hard
that database guy tho walking through an xray border too much scifi bro
things that have to happen1 mexico should kill all cartels they know where they are and who they are lets be real2 mexico needs to legalize drugs the problem here is that the us goverment wants to keep silent on the drug use on military forces due to ptsd and other mental disorders many legal drugs sold in us are very ineffective the best way to keep it low is the consume of mariguana soif mexico legalize mariguana it means that prize will lower in mexico so drug cartels wont have big money and will be out of business for the us is also means the lowering prize in mariguana making it more accesible but it will later add heavy taxes like cigarettes this will also make the us report huge amount of purchases in mariguana each year entering into the us military budget if us people find out the country buys excessive amounts of drugs and making mexico richer the us wont be able to fund any wars in the future which in consequence means less firearms production therefore less production in primary resources for their making etc3 mexico needs to lower taxes and have more flow on money for its citizens the country has a serious fiscal problem practices and mexicans are not willing to pay them because its a heavy tax that can barely cover their basic necessities they cross to the us to get better money and better opportunities for a livingsoif us doesnt address the necessity they need for mariguana and mexico continues the way it is without changing their policies it is understandable that a wall has to be built to keep out drugs and unwanted people the other problem that i have of giving illegals the opportunity to become citizens and pay taxes is that they also earn the right to vote if us legalizes every mexican and other southern american people that go there is it changes the demography and geopolitics in the us and power in elections therefore mexicans can have a say so in us politics since they will be like 20 of the us population so if us wants to protect its sovereignty they should just let born us citizens to vote and a electronic id tag or a chip of some sortno thanks dude i want my right to privacy a passport and the border politics are good as they are
got ad before video of crtv with clip of 2 genders change my mind i was like a mistaken re upload
china has a wall brazil has a wall im sure thats not it
if we gave every one a magical truth dragon that spit cotton candy when some one was being naughty the world would be fixed that is basically what i heard when that vloger talked that look on your face said it all at the end
sometimes it is so hard to watch these because it is just so surprising how stupid people can be
that guy living in 3018 lol
these people are cleary crazy or on drugsmaybe both
that guy had to be coked out of his mind
that last guys argument summed up if the illegals just had papers of be fine like give them a numbersomeone should tell him thats legal  immigration with papers and what not
i want steven to debate kyle kulinski
the satisfaction my face hurt from the shape it took trying to comprehend that man the final look was all i needed hilarious
that guy man lol made almost no sense at times to understand what he was saying
so many people are lacking common sense nowadays i am worried about our future
i feel like i just got dumber watching this guy talk
im mexican and i agree there needs to be tighter border security a wall will probably be a solution but  in the long run its not really practical it will be torn down sooner or later if it ever does get built and it was all just a waste highering more border patrol will also not work since already border patrol agents are being bought by the drug cartelsima propose an idea here and yall will probably think im stupid mexicans immigrating here arent really a big problem its the gullible people coming from the south americas through mexico that are bribed by the cartels to do some stupid shit so if the united states forces mexico to strengthen their border on the south side immigration flow will be greatly reduced at our border which will make it easier for us to control our border if you think mexico is a shit hole wait till you see el salvador
i love these videos even if i dont always agree with you the thought that people can just sit down and converse about their different views on topics is so beautiful
what did i just listen to lol
they only believe what the higher up dems tell them
please read professionallyi dont agree with the wall since it probably wouldnt get approved andor it would take time to build the wall past the time of this presidency what trump is doing right now which is actually enforcing the current immigration laws it completely correct the coyotes who get people across are smart and would find a way to get people over also it would raise taxes in the states which would make a lot of people mad and may cause a minor economic crisis
leroy is not spanish pretty fuckin mexican maybe native
are idiots the only people that sit down or are they only conversations they feature
where is the climate changeglobal warming change my mind
man that one dude was high af
you know what get me is when they say the wall wont stop them but then their get all mad about building the wall if they wall wont stop them then let donald trump build the wall and then he look stupid for it not working but they wont do that cuz they know in the back of their head that the wall is going to stop like 80 of them lol
that guy is a fucking nut and he wants to run for office
yep illegals are going to just voluntarily ask to come in identifying themselveswith no border where these things would be required
holy fuck americans are so beyond retarded i cant even
oh boy another day another change my mind time to soak up those liberal tears again
my questions is statistically who are the ones doing the drugs  im pretty sure that young guy with the camera is
hes so fucking stupid will fit in perfect with new mexico
the wall will be a boondoggle especially since most illegals arrive here on planes yes human beings have been living with air travel for almost a century now and just never leave
1205  it wont slow down because of people like him infiltrating our country and corrupting our politics with double standards resentment vitriol racism and fearthis man may not be any of these things himself other than ignorant but he in his ignorance is allowing for the door to be open to other horrible people to do the aforementioned things
so xray the whole board hmm doesnt xray cause alot of very bad helth issues cancer being the nices of them
my friends that come here legally have parties when they get the papers its a lot of work that i dont even know if i could do first try respecting laws of a country is what you do regardless of the country just a bigger mouthpiece of lawbreaking because we were built on rebellion nah we had the alamo happen as wellreset your register
the last guy was an idiot he probably has to frequently be reminded how to wipe his but if he does
debate yousef or youre a cuck  change my mind
the way crowder looks at the camera at the end 
leroy what youve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard at no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul
guy with ow hat seems like a cool dude
doesnt have to be a wall it could be some kid of x ray xd seems like a good way to give a lot of people cancer what an idiot xd
this guy just explained what would make a pretty good syfy movie xray borders that scan your number
that ignorant fool the future mayor of new mexicoreally should shut his mouth because i dont know if his dumb assery is contagious
the only reason im against building the wall is the fact were in debt and the wall project is projected to cost 81 billion dont quote me on that lmao either cut the cost down waaaayyyy more or make more defenses on border patrol and inside the us as well in some sort of way i believe it will help economically of securing the border but the us debt at this point is literally bordering pun not intended our future an pathway as a society economically as a whole wish i was there to talk down and speak because everyone speaks emotionally and not with factsstatistics
meh sounds like a good idea but the walls gonna be like billions of dollars
this one wasnt that good go to a college millennial would love to show their ideas
this spanish dude is fucking autistic lol
2nd guy is so all over the place ideas dont connect and no borders in 510 years 
i prefer when you do these on college campuses its way funnier seeing the hateful leftists get triggered  makes my day
the gentleman who never had a case was annoying ending every word in his sentence with uh
i feel like i have somehow  became stupid by listening to this guy and  his free thought i like these change my minds videos but man this guy was the worst one ever it wasnt even enjoyable
really funny watching massively gay jarred pacing about
thar last guy just described even more draconian check points than we already have that people just go around he calls it a gate but what is a gate without a wall or fence on either side lol the only way to get people to use the damn gate is to make it their only port of entry
the real spaniard would have told leroy you keep using that word i do not think it means what you think it means
this woman is a crazy liberal and you shouldnt have talked to her  she was looney  the next guy said blame the drug dealers instead of the people bringing the drugs in  nevermind the guy is fuckin nuts too
that guy might be the dumbest person interviewed im gonna be the governor of new mexico lmao
not the best change my mind but keep them coming
this man is living in the year 2200 where trump is hailed as a hero xrayborders
liberals are gay soft douches change my mind
leroy has a gender studies degree
i dont think building a wall would be realistic
i seem to remember something about troy and the greeks something about a horse and opening a gate to get it in and the trojans being taken over etc hmm i hear similarities there
the liberal logic of why build it if they will still find a way in is absurd then why even have laws because criminals are still gonna commit crimes
he wants more freedom with less borders his solution is to tag everyone so you can get scanned and identified presumably with drones or some other technology sounds like a recipe for tyranny to me
you should have at least a 6th grade education requirement for these interviews
not gay jared lookin suspiciously gay in the background
building a wall will do nothing theres already a wall
build the xray boarder
tax the western union by 10  if it goes out of the country
boy i wasandam legitimately worried for that first lady  glad you blurred her face buti dont know she might still be in danger  i hope the advice you gave her offcamera winds up helping her
crowder id love to talk to you im from venezuela and immigrated legally i have so many stories and points id love to bring up
why are leftists bitching about the kids detained at the border 10000 of the 12000 detained came unaccompanied by parents if they were seeking refugee status then they shouldve came to a point of entry instead of crossing illegally if american parents get arrested their children get taken into custody why should we hold foreign criminals to a lesser standard than our own theyre being kept in cages no theyre being kept secure in rooms that are made from easily constructable chain link walls so that they can easily accommodate the numbers seethrough walls are way more scary and more inhumane than solid walls is basically what theyre saying give me a break theyre being provided way better food than what im getting at home theyre apparently being provided things like burgers fries ect while i an american born citizen am roughing it with ramen noodles and brown beans leftists have no solid foundation to stand upon for their argument on this issue since they advocate for the killing of babies in the womb
rip xxxtentacion
that last guy sure does like to ramble on
from new mexico moved to austin im not going to say this guy doesnt have a chance of becoming governor
1022 yeah and while were at it lets get some sharks with laser beams that fire from their eyes to patrol the waterways and hoverturrets to float above this magic wall
i really enjoy when 2 people of opposing viewpoints sit down and have a calm and civil debate on current issues its nice to see that there are still people who havent gone insane
622 what percentage commit crimes steven how did you miss that golden opportunity to respond with all of them if theyre here illegally theyre all criminals duh
was it just me or was it extra stupid people on this particular changer my mind
x ray borders the future we need
please do this at the university of texas at el paso its right next to the mexican border
we are all just a little bit dumber now from hearing his thoughts 
my heart goes out to the woman first speaking to steven i feel awful for her she watches people come here illegally and cause crime while she came here legally bless you maam america loves you
i cannot see a problem with the wall besides the money but money aside i think its a good idea idk how its a bad thing and the guy who said make an xray border instead of the wall hes crazy lmao
masterminds
why do all the defenders of open borders speak broken english
222 crowder put some damn pants on lmao
the majority of illegals use tunnels or come legally and dont leave when the visa is up its better to use the money for the wall to find the tunnels and close them and to just round up the ones that over stay
these two people seriously sounded like they have the minds of 12 year olds i dont mean that in a mean way but they sounded solike they had no critical thinking skillshe was talking about electronic tagsits so ridiculous the educational system he went through failed him id be shocked if the first lady finished high school
could you guys include links in your description for some of the statistics you mention because that 37 of murders number is mind blowing id like to see where that actually comes from because it seems like thats a conversation ender its so extreme
i want this shirt
that look at the end though
whatever charm austin used to have is long gone have watched this city since the late 60s turn into a nasty cesspool of liberal scum
what a waste of money to build the wall
mexican women be thick ass hell they can stay but mexican men have to go back
the second person was actually very smart but his airport style machines might be almost as much as the wall
this was the most uneducated bunch of change my mind people yet
beep beep none of them changed my mind  beep beep
i wish you would come to aubreydenton tx i think it would be amazing
im not for the wall just because it would be impractical it really wouldnt stop the cartels from crossing drugs their business is way too big for them just to let it die so they probably would build tunnels or think of some way to get drugs in and a wall would take so long to build and so much money that probably some other administration would just decide to never finish it or even demolish it there has to be better ways to keep ilegal immigrants out like a sensor or different stations where homeland security could monitor the border
cant they start checking for state id more often instead
dont build the wall change my mind
ahh tolerance
maybe instead of like an xray border you guys could like have the autobots patrol your border instead autobots assemble
whoever thinks that building a wall is the best way to stop illegal immigration are dumb its just a dumb chant trump said so people would vote for him our taxes are high enough as it is i would think that maybe we should make patrolling the border community service for people with minor crime speeding and such  but if you guys actually wana take on a project as big as building a wall across the whole border with mexico that will cost money we dont have  because we are already in debt  you are just either trolling or  are absorbed just as much in your ignorant ideologies as liberals  illegal immigration is a problem but i think you would have to be a simpleton to think that building a wall would be the best way to stop it
a tweeker indian named leroy wtf
im surprised ridley is in smash bros ultimate
xray this guy an einstein
that guy and that lady need to recuse themselves from the american gene pool
do jesus of nazareth is the messiah change my mind in a jewish community and you can compare the hostility toward you in jewish communities verses in muslim communities with israel has a right to exist change my mind
the majority of immigrants come by plane and overstay their visas  so it would have to be some big freakin wall
as a mexican american i will never argue that illegal immigration is okay it is as the name suggests illegal but i believe that it is up to america to decide if we want to handle this issue with compassion or with an iron fist i personally know many illegal immigrants who live honest lives and contribute to american society these are good people who only wanted to find a better life for their families i believe that they shouldnt go unpunished but that they shouldnt be deported these people have built lives and relationships with americans and have more importantly raised kids who only know of america and are for all intents and purposes american the answer is making it easier to gain citizenship you have to take this dumb ass test that most americans couldnt pass i guess just try to have a little more compassion and understanding when your screaming for these people to get deported
do one on global warming
the strategic move would be to assimilate all of mexico then build the wall
im surprised how poorly these people express themselves
i have a headache now
the first woman who sat down was something asking steven how she can report the illegals and still against the wall and scared of it she confused me and unsettled me even
send whites back to europe that sounds about right
the starei was doing the same steven wow that guys going to be a great governor
next one do religion is a lie change my mind
i dont know like you know im a if i said if it isnt probably hasnt im this is a free thought right now so for me to execute this i would have to get like a few a mastermind individuals to really sit down and think this over i can not tell you blaablaablatant answer right now
hahaha funny ending
the wall just got 10 feet higher
most arguments i have with people are based on emotion and no facts to back them up so when i produce facts for my argument they resort to yelling and throwing out the possibility of having a civil argument lol
leroy stoned af
do you like to travel and see the great wall in china it was built to defend the dynasty against its rivals in the north a boarder line embodied so wired that the americans dislike the idea of boarder
bless that first ladys heart she sounded so sincere i hope she got some good information on addressing her problems without any repercussion legal immigration is what this country is all about if you dont like the laws tuff shit
build the wall now deport the illegals asap  create harsher punishment for all illegals that come here from now on 
i really like your youtube  i appreciate how you encourage dialog and respectfully exchange view points
xray
build the wall separate them from their kids if they try should do it and leroy is an idiot
lol steven does a great job keeping these people on track and not going off into a tangent
why so short of a video
i love how the second guy wants this sort of digital tracking system implemented for immigrants its kinda racist  but more importantly its just a more technologically advanced system than what we have now and what he is aginst
i love how they say you cant stop illegal imagination my response we landed on the moon piss off lol
why only 13mins of this i want more
i think that most reasonable people in both parties believe in national sovereignty but trump has made this a very toxic and divisive issue much like the nfl kneeling issue
that spanish dude was a bumbling moron he just talked to talk making no valid legitimate point i feel dumber after listening to him
theyare human leveliq this is animal vs human sorry but its true
you know what these people did change my mind wall just got 30 feet higher
the first woman had a plant in a soda bottle
as soon as leroy sat down you can tell he was nervous and wasnt thinking straight its funny seeing crowders relaxed and intellectual tone compared with leroys confused and lost tone i think crowder should have told him to take a deep breath and relax for a minute so he could think everything out trying to drive without turning on the engine whatever show or company leroy is recording for should consider getting someone else
wow
damn steven how are we supposed to focus on the conversation with you rocking the short shorts like that im going to have to take a cold shower now
first woman she identifies with her ethnic group she views the wall as an attack on her people she has an in group preference that most minorities have only white people view themselves as individuals but everyone else sees us as part of a group
giant guns that tag everyone at the border
the wall is a waste of money it will not stop no one and i dont want my tax money poorly managed we need to invest our money in americans
i disagree with building the wall building the wall would be a massive and costly undertaking with not enough valid results the government is beyond broke we cant afford it what we need to do is to remove the incentive to come here illegally if we had strict laws on businesses for using illegal labor stronger deportation laws and make it impossible for them to find any work here it would remove most any drive for them to come to america illegally maybe then we could build a superhighway from the border and funnel all the illegal immigrants to canada and see how well they put up with it d
build the wall change my mind  well ladders step stools grappling hooks getting a boost from a friend parkour theres alot of options
that first lady was so sweet
the guy with the cleveland indians hat on in the background youre my dude
dont build a wall put everyone under government surveillance and shove tracking devices in their skin instead
the look on crowders face at the end  
omg this guy gave me a headache and lowered my iq i actually feel stupiderah
the face you make when you lose a little faith in humanity
that mexican dude was high af he had the solution to every problem that very articulate way he weaves these words that dont exist between ideas he just came up with its all bullshit but i dont care xray gates
what fucking show would mr x ray border have   sweet strains
do a video on what you think of buzzfeed what it is like to be a girl
this is just an outstandingly painful level of stupidity from interview number 2
scientifical 1057
love this series but imo its more interesting when hes on college campuses hes like a vaccine being inserted into the sea of liberal disease
first chick feels badfirst dude what a moron you cant force them to become legal they are illegal because they dont want to pay taxes or follow the laws they would rather destroy the country than build it up i know people who are here legally all the bullshit like its hard or they make you wait is bullshit because my friends did it in no time at all mastermind individuals what this dude is braindead kinda sad and he has his own show i wouldnt watch that shit clearly just pure stupid spreading stupidity oh lol im here with go green global so they should fire this moron rofl
crowders reaction at 1032
that ending was so office like 
this was the least informative change my mind segment
so the spanish guy pretty much wants to fit every immigrant with an rfid tag gps or something like it to track people like dogs hmmm seems way worse than just building a wall also i dont hear anyone complaining about the fence with razor wire thats in place right now on the border i guess thats ok but a wall is just way out of the question for some people lol
we need a xray border now lol
729  youre educating him this is good
mental gymnastics  and ignorance
why does every other immigrant have to come here legally oh because they have to fly here get passports visas etc but mexicans get a free pass because theyre connected to the us that second kid is so lost
why are people so dumb one of the easiest arguments against the wall is that the main way illegal immigration occurs is through visa overstays and contrary to popular belief most people do not just jump the border
the woman at the beginning was wonderful god bless her the guy at the end doesnt realize what he is talking about is already being planned but for everyone on the planet
im not the first to say this anyone reading this please reiterate it steven please cover her id tag she is in danger
homeboy done figured it out or whatever eye
bad eye sight  not yelling   the thing that surprised me most about this one was how funny it was to watch those secret service try hards you got for security checking the perimeter ps ngj  has small everything
the second guy sounds like a nazi lol
all throughout history walls have always worked there is no reason we shouldnt have one
i never clicked on a video so fast in my life
uhhhhhh what
definitely dont agree with the last dude but i genuinely appreciate anyone who can sit down and have a rational conversation on topics like this great video
that dude was talkin some nonsense lol borders are a thing of the past  lol ya tell that to israel  syria  go tell china that the border is a thing of the past  hahahaha x ray borderswhy didnt people think if that should be easy to get illegal inmigrants to go ahead n get chipped b4 the jump thru the mexican teleporter lol
my against the wall argument is that it is pointless a lot of illegal immigrants just get tourist visas and just stay in the country so they just fly over here hell a lot of people marry for citizenship legal workers who are trying just to work in the usa have a lot of procedures to even just be qualified and it takes years because illegals have made it that hard not every illegal is mexican a wall wont deter drug dealers from coming in theyve trained to hide in plain sight or like i said just take a tourist flight or a touris bus ride to get here we tax payers are just gonna be paying for millions for something ultimately pointless we need tighter laws about not hiring illegals why does no one blame businesses the ones hiring illegals are the reason why illegals are even coming in if they get severe repercussions for hiring illegals more businesses will be forced to hire legal citizens  and discourage illegals from coming in the first place
i think he was talking about a yray wall
build the xray wall
if someone can find the guys youtube channel let us know for the trolls
stevens face at the end was the best part 
im starting to think we should build 2 walls
thought the thumbnail was a skinny cenk
how do i report those peoplebut you should blur her whole body because some people might realize who she is because of her bag
that guy is definitely a little off but going to what you say steve i feel like border security is important but the path to citizenship is definitely not easy my father had been in the country legally for 25 years and just got his papers december  and paid over 10000 for his papers it is very difficult confusing process if you are not born from money or at least middle class
i think i lost brain cells listening to that second guy he may not know it but dude is literally talking about the mark of the beast
she said she could be deported
you should black her out instead of just the blur
042 best part
the second guyah is the dumbestuh guyuh i have ever seen on this showah so farah
since there was a lack of good responses i feel i should throw my 2 cents ini dont think the wall is a good idea because i dont think it solves the largest problems we have right now with illegal immigration there are 2 much larger problems i see that should be focused on first not saying a wall may be a better answer down the road1 sanctuary cities show that citizens dont care what the government says if people in america dont want to protect america it is much more difficult to prevent illegal immigration 2 obtaining a work visa but failing to follow up with becoming a citizen is the major way illegal immigrants enter our country changes need to be made to help make it easier to become a citizen if you saw how difficult it was you would understand what im saying and enforcing deportation to those that let their visas expire will help combat this issuebut good luck fixing number 2 with out solving number 1
our militarygovernment is the biggest importer of illegal drugs we supply the poppy growers in afghanistan with cash and then we bring it back and sell it on the streets theres a heroine epidemic in this country particularly in the midwest why not expose our corrupt government why do you think obama kept us in that country
i wish this was longer
did you run into anyone that wasnt insane xray open borders im speechless
im not mexican im spanish  hahahahaha yeah he doesnt look mayan or aztec at all this guy is a mestizo all the way  80 aztecmayan and 20 spanish at most he probably hasnt seen a mirror in like forever
the second dude is living in a fantasy world
the hill just reported that chuck schumer shot down mcconnells stop separating families at the border law chucks explanation was he wanted to keep the pressure on trump so hes concerned about immigrant children being traumatized but not enough to do anything himself
i feel bad for the first lady
why is this one so short
dont build a wall build an xray border that fries them into some  taquitos
i love the stare at the end that guy was misinformed
i dont know whether that first ladys interview was funny or terrifying leroy seems like hes still working on adjusting his meds to the proper dosages damn you know you got some weird ones when danielle the transgender man seems sane and normal by comparison
the wall is a waste of money high up front cost plus maintenance forever the effectiveness will be questionable people will go over under through and around it it does not change the reasons  people cross illegally short term the solution is laws that add verification for work and any kind of assistance long term we have to end the drug war it puts a multi billion dollar industry into the hands of criminals the profits are used to buy officials and further corrupt already ineffective native governments the drug demand is not going to disappear america loves drugs in the restricted market left in the wake of the drug war the only possible way to defend profits is with violence the only way to secure production space distribution and market share is violence that is not just true in mexico and south america but right here in the us toothe war on drugs has wreaked havoc in poorer areas of all races it exacerbates an already high rate of single motherhood which leads injections of welfare which leads to more single mothers which lets to more crime and violence as opportunity is further reducedpeople zoom in to much that they do not see the bigger picture of issueschange my mind love the show
build the wall fine america can do whatever they want within their territory but mexico doesnt have to pay for it
steven vettings important weed out crack heads  meth addicts  you cant let em just wander on set cop a squat  start blabbing lol
yes weve been wanting you to do this forever my man
this first channel helps understand the bible from a scientific perspectivehttpswwwyoutubecomuserreasonstobelieve1featuredthis channel is good for addressing supposive bible erros amogst other things httpswwwyoutubecomuserinspiringphilosophyfeaturedand a third channel that is very helpful in navigating through the bible itself httpswwwyoutubecomchannelucvfwlh9xpx2ytqfjeln9qafor those who are interested i recommend these channels for understanding why the bible is valid
dunning kruger effect is strong in this one
can somebody snipe that guy please thanks in advance 
block her id too lol
you legalized them and they vote freakin democrat or for establishment republicans no thank you
feminism is dead  change my mind
i think i got dumber watching this video lmao
im gonna go out on a limb here and say the second guy prob thinks ppl are talking about martians when they say illegal aliens just a vibe lol
crowders statistics are complete lies ever notice how he never cites the sources of the stats he provides undocumented immigrants do not commit 37 of the murders in this country as crowder asserts at 631 and i challenge any of you to link to a study that proves otherwise
i think he is trying to describe rfid we have that with enhanced licenses and i believe its going nationwide soon
thousands of real shovel ready jobs
what a boring guy that second one good luck with your next governor new mexico
change my build wall the mind
his alternatives to the wall assumes everyone will follow his laws and assumes people wont bypass his alternatives the way illegals bypass our border now
people dont realize how stupid they sound yeah lets let them live here so that they dont pay any taxes get paid off the books as they say from crooked americans who use them like slave labor as well yeah lets do that thats a great idea lets let them come over here and do the jobs that we have for a lot less money because they getting paid in cash and lets give them those jobs so that we dont have any because were just lazy filthy americans who dont want to work only thing wrong with that is every single one of us goes out there everyday and breaks our ass for pennies after the government takes all my money to give to people like them  to pay for their emergency visits to pay for their children to go to school to pay for the childrens lunches to pay for everything that they get when theyre here for free as well as being off the books which any american would love to be paid in cash so the government wouldnt know what theyre making and take half of it that goes for americans too who are lazy asses time for the free ride to be over for all meanwhile both of my children have student loans up their ass and i dont have any money to help them with it what do i get you know what ive gotten so far in 51 years nada baby so yeah i take offense to anyone whose not a citizen here thinking they are somehow owed anythingif anyones owed its me bitchesget in lineyour 45 years of paying  behind meh i dont have the money to take care of your children i need to take care of my own children sorry
build the wall around ca and deport the left
i lost brain cells listening to this guy
second dude blew my mind with his scientificalness
change my mind is literally my favorite thing on youtube
im not even mexican and i think building a wall is a stupid waste of money people will still find a way in there are better ways to deal with immigration this guys really ignorant just lost respect for him
go pro dude lives in a weird scifi fantasy world
i plan on being the governor of new mexico so ive been thinkingyou have a lot more patience than me steven keep theses up though
man that last interview was like watching a new star wars movie so many plot holes btw i just rewatched the covenant today and it was great to see a familiar face haha itd be cool to follow your footsteps someday
2 days in a row the ad on the vid was crtv
how much  has the cartels produced by selling drugs in the us how much  would it take to produce two elevators and a 100 mile tunnel you short sighted fart heads
eddie bravo without jiu jistu
i love how speaker 2 basically sets current standards you have to do to come here legally he wasnt even talking about immigration he was thinking about visiting the whole part describes a similar setup to what we currently have where people who come here legally basically have to sign in and sign out every time they come or go even when heading out of state commonly states have their own border patrol to watch for people doing illegal activities such as for the states with legal marijuana they have people ensuring that these citizens who buy it arent leaving the state with it unless for medical purposes
i like how at the end of the day that second guy was inadvertently arguing the need for a wall an xray wall
as a canadian i dont know a huge heap about this topic but i do agree with securing the border knowing who comes in etc but the wall as a giant brick wall fourty feet high the cost of that is monumentally vast as well as the cost of maintaining it a wall is moronic but securing the border through other means patrolling the border better enforcement and deportation of those who would do harm to americans i fully agree everything is reasonable a giant physical wall is a bit dumbedit a fence is cheaper tooi also want to ask how many illegal immigrants come through by just walking across a desert wouldnt most pass through some port of entry then overstay their visiting visa
1030 some kind of xray scanner wtf
to short  you should publish the raw footage  is not like i dont have it or that it will cost you money
these were some dumb mexicans wish there was someone educated there have a real conversation with
i love how he has a reasonable discussion and is willing to listen to the other side of the spectrum
the spanish guy sounds so stupid and keeps contradicting himself
leroy is an idiot
i was a substitute teacher for a gym a few years back i was told an entire elementary classroom spoke only spanish how many do you think are from families of illegals
these change my mind segments should have to be a minimum of 60 minutes or longer they are just too entertaining
you guys realize that most illegals over stay their visas a wall wont stop that in fact you people are idiots for even thinking this is a good idea
the second guy has to be special needs or he is the best actor in the world
that guy made some good points honestly he really believes in positivity but i just dont think those ideas would work in action but im happy with how formal these convos have been steven keep it up man i love these
wow some people just have no idea how reality works
illegals can get welfare and 10 jobs instantly after arriving  thats what needs to end the wall wont do shit if they can operate once theyre here
that second dudes ignorance and general stupidity is showing
mexicans are great at building underground tunnels also mexicans also use a thing called a airplane also they are not a prehistoric civilisation ffs get off your high horse
that spaniard definitely has native american blood
guy with white shirt is missing a chromosome 
fuck the wall
this guy is talking about micro chipping people 
finally more more more
people just dont understand what a fucking wall i used for walls have gatesdoors its not just a fucking giant stone slab theres a way in legally
its weird being here before this video inevitably gets millions of views sorry for this not being related to the videos content
cant force people to bring a valid electronic passcode or phone etc with them when they cross the border if theres no border enforcement
sure we should award them for com 8k ng here illegally this fck face is dumb
fuck me that spanish idiot wtf
this was painful to watch
i understand the kid probably wasnt ready to give an idea about border security buuut in order to secure the borders have no borders  and we can just have them give up basic human rights of free travel within their new country in order to give them the freedom to be in a new country and we tag their location every so often to make sure they are still here but we let them aah hell with it  i feel dumber
when you put your own created ads on your own videos really tricking the system of the youtube dictators eh
35  of illegal are mexican and they commit 37 of crimei get trouble with the percentage brought up in here i thought that mexican made the majority of illegal immigration 
this person has no grasp on the technology in this country we cant detect people in that way not even 510 years from now
this guy must be american hes dumb af as everybody else here 
dudes talking ab some star trek scifi xray border tech lol sounds like something china is trying to do he didnt really think his perposal thru sounds like anything but a wall type jargon
hey youre white how do i get these people deported
fucking xray walls  is he serious 
just ask any guest who doesnt want the wallif an illegal immigrant came into their house  and killed one of their beloved family members what should be the outcome 
leroy was the most cringy change my mind that i have ever seen
i dont know a proper scientifical
spanish guy was cool
1 good question do you have walls in your housewell its the same reason why this country and states need walls to for your safety
we should be allowed to execute these people on site that would stop future generations from coming over
this is all well and good but the editor did a fucking garbage job at hiding her identity
scientifical
i love english scientifical lol
donald trump is racist change my mind
the second guy is so cringy  
master mindsbuild the wall with a machine gun nest every 100 feet
lol the second dude was nice but he thinks electronically tagging every illegal that crosses the border how like cattle is a more reasonable and effective solution than a border wall
screw that please do this one again the first person wasnt very articulate and the second was more opinionated than he needed to be though he was much better than the first
hopefully the mexican lady is ok anyone that lives in her neighborhood will recognize her voice and what shes wearing she probably shouldve talked to him about her neighborhood off camera
finally
yeah boi keep putting out these videos
gee wiz
the guy is just rambling out of his a knee jerk reaction with the wall justbuildit
hi mr crowder im that free loader  thank you loads putting up your videosthough i do not support trump awful president really i do support our constitution
my iq has finally dropped to subzero levels
the wall worked with a 90 improvement in stopping illegal immigration in poland so im sold
2nd guy we are all people no borders fair treatment  steven how can we tax them  how can we monitor them 2nd guy some sort of electronic id tag or scanners wo a way to control flow through said scannersso electric tags for them sounds niceand no way to actually control flow in and out of the country with an xray scanner border  sounds worthless and expensive
a new mexico gubernatorial ad calling for constant global gps tracking of all individuals would barely register on the embarrassing progressive campaign ad ratings in 2018
how can i meet these masterminds
these are some weak ass arguments like there are actually good arguments against this lol it sucks that people are so uneducated and then come and spew out whatever theyve heard their friends say
i really respect the people that actually sit down to talk to you stating their own opinions because thats what america is all about but when people yell at you with no reasonable argument it makes me want to punch them in the face what you do on this channel is great so glad im subscribed
holy shit just got an actual crowder ad before your video 
hmm lame i want more from this one i was expecting some long heated debates
electronic id tagging of citizens that guy is an orwellian dystopian governments dream
louderwithcrowder are there any real arguments that are edited out or is the lefts defense truly this weak i think the wall is a terrible idea and sure as hell could discuss it for at least 5 minutes
that new mexican guy wants to be a slave via 1984 please tax me and track my every movement
end drug prohibition and the welfare state and then no need for a wall come on people you all know that its the fact be a true libertarian be an american be an anarchocapitalist btw i wanted rand paul but was town chair for trump in nh trump is very cool compared to all the statists
i think the spanish  guy is actually legit retarded
out of those 37 murderers that are illegal citizens how many deaths are accounted for other illegal citizens i find it hard to believe that those illegals are killing american citizens at that rate
wait is crowder wearing his ranger panties
that was painful
the only reason i think that building a wall isnt going to solve a damn thing is because people are still going to find other ways to get into this country illegally also the idea that trump has that mexico is gonna pay for a wall is also stupid because they arent gonna pay for a damn thing yes illegal immigrants should apply for citizenship the proper way but the reason people who come from third world countries like guatemala they dont have money to get their citizenship because there is a fee and for the people who are already here illegally who want to apply for citizenship risk being deported taken from their families and facing jail time in their own countries they are being robbed rapped and their government is so corrupted to the point where calling the police for help doesnt help because theyll rob and rape you too and they are running from that thats why people break the law of coming here illegally if youre here as an immigrant just to break the law fuck that and fuck you because you make the rest of them look bad the people who actually are here to change their lives for the better to provide for their families to get an education for those who pay their taxes and follow the law youre ruining it for the rest of them
xray scanner but no border or wall im done
bullshit steven crowder you just keep lying and lying to try to look good donald trump has said several times that mexicans are bringing in drugs and criminals through the border stop fucking lying you fuck
a lot of people describe this ideal process that sounds a lot like what we already have in place that their not following
420 might find some areas where we disagree versus areas where we disagree
hey guvnah
there is already a wall just saying
that he thinks its easier to build a giant xray than build a wall
the second guy wasnt very smart lol
grats on 2 million subs
what this guy has been thinking about this for 3 years i would not have thought that
i agree that we do need to build or at least reinforce the wall i love mexico and my family and friends from there but those who try to come in illegal should at least make it an effort to become citizens if many people come in and take money from the government but dont put in as much as a regular citizen would then im sorry
illegal hispanics are the trash of our country not racist just a fact
i bet when steven was done he was disappointed that there wasnt 1 person to have a intelligent conversation with kind of a waste of a day
xray detector in the middle of the desert brilliant
i love that crowder looks into the camera like hes jim from the office
second guy wants 1984
hey im as much of futurist as the next person but that dude is very mistaken about how soon these changes could feasibly take place widescale the economics of infrastructure innovations and changes are very complicated
100 of illegal immigrants commit crimes
the new mexico guy was literally describing a wall 
garbage episode lol
the left is collectively retarded  change my mind
id need to speak 2 a particular individual idiocracy
that second guy must have been high or something
even though i am rightleaning i cant support the wall not because of the cost not because of immigration issues but because of the environmental problems it creates it cuts off certain animal populations many of which are endangered or threatened from moving back and forth across the border in order to find suitable habitat i cant support something that severely hurts the environment and further fragments habitat that is already scarce some of these species are on the brink of extinction as it is
ever heard of a plane a rope a shovel a boat the 4th of july when everybody and their mother is shitfaced this isnt the 15th century we need a dome
listening to that last guy was cancer
second dude made absolutely zero sense
that guy was so hard to listen to he used absolutely no logic and didnt engage in the conversation meaningfully
immigration related change my mind 
lovin the hottie in the background
that second guy literally had no idea what he was talking about
just make them citizens and tax them you cant tax hordes of welfare recipients only who drain away the tax dollars of actual working people leroy has no clue how reality works
i work in an industry comparable to picking strawberries  i am a construction worker  carpenter and i can tell you in the last 30 years  wages have stagnated and have gone down in real terms a great part of the reason is illegals   yes they work hard just like i do  i have worked with many of them i talk with them and try to understand  i fully understand wanting to come here for a better life where there hard work translates into prosperity  in all my years  when payday came  all illegals got an envelop filled with cash and i got a check with deductions  in essence  i made less for the same work  on a side note  in my years  i have seen less and less black workers in the residential  they used to be the masons  painters  concrete and a few carpenters  they are all gone   now if i was a celebrity or someone in a field of work that required a degree like medical or financial  i wonder if i would be on the side of open borders  because i know it wouldnt affect me but help me to have a guy mow my yard for a few bucks
super fast and cheap travel in 5 to 10 years  boy theyve been promising that dream since the 50s and almost 70 years later were not that much closer probably further as air travel has probably gotten a bit slower in those long packed airport lineups that are dissuading people from flying
family has lived in new mexico since the 1550shuh
so cattle tags yeah thats worked out in the past
said wall would only keep people in not out look at the history of walls our border walls keep people form leaving america more than they keep people from illegally immigrating
watching this video and videos like nuance bro that interview people make me realise that americans are so ready for nwo its fuckin terrifying to be honest that guy literally said we should chip people that coupled with the lefts willingness to abandon the 2nd ammendment and free speech and promote truly demonic shit like infinite genders  etc and just the total stupidity i see were a dictatorship waiting to happen
steven couldve really done well with being on a debate team younger in life hed be a lot more humble he gets off on making people feel intellectually short
then americans are selling the drugs they so you cant point the finger only at the illegal immigrants yeah no one is doing that illegal immigrants that bring drugs in have to first bring them in have ever heard of addressing the root of a problem no druggy in no druggy to selly genius
give them citizenship and then tax them hey dipshit there are already millions of americans who are willing to work and be taxed but they cant because illegal scum take the jobs and dont pay taxes and also get welfare food stamps section 8 free housing yeah fuck that retard and fuck every last illegal scumbag in my country
i consider this a small percentage of things  statistics the man 2018
its so obvious might as well ask do you wish to see white people drowned out and dead in their own countries or not mexicans would like to see more mexicans around them than white people its only natural its somehow unnatural though when white people want to be around white people and protect their borders that is somehow unconscionable so one side can express fierce ethnocentrism while the other side has to publicly renounce any type of in group preference wonder which side is going to win
good luck with that governor fairytale
mastermind individual herei have the solution to what he wants we need a big wall with x rays and by x rays i am sure he meant extermination rays
xray scanner that shit is funny good lord that guy is a few beans short of a burrito
i feel out of breath just listening to the second guy
colin moriarty on how to fix illegal immigrationhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv7skvqkhcp74
xray is this the future
god that was soooo cringy to watch im actually surprised i made it through the whole thing i was actually looking forward to another solid debate by you no real surprise that all the opposers just wanted to shout profanities and flip the bird i found it funny that both interviewees actually wanted the wall in one form or another hahaim really only opposed to the wall for financial reasons i think its a pretty significant waste of money but at the same time we do have a large problem even if we were to offer free citizenship and perhaps even free healthcare for a period of time to entice them to want to become legal im not sure we would see much change i think the outrage we are seeing from people crying about people being deported is a little misguided the option was always there to become legal its not like the individual was only there a couple of weeks id say its more than likely been years of them mooching i wish more people thought more logically about the situation instead of just crying about a wall and deportation just like driving your car if you speed you will eventually be caught if you dont change your oil youll eventually blow your motor there will be consequences for not coming over legally so why not just change your oil asap
love these segments really helps inform me on facts used to be anti gun until i saw your change my mind on gun control now im an owner of a fire arm and try to inform my friends on the misconceptions on gun control
the second guy is delusional man hes fucking nuts
that poor lady i hope she stays safethat guy i had to scroll to the comment because i was grimacing so hard he would agree with you until he realised it was direct contradiction to his previous statementah yes he foresees all countries dissolving their borders it is not like people engaged in war for many years throughout the centuries in order to secure their countries and obtain more landwithout borders countries could not exist you would end up with a single government ruling the actual fucking earth
this is silly the whole idea of a wall began when the barbarians were coming into a groups village and rping and pillaging and leaders were born who created defensible lines that protected their women and children the borders can only expand when you are sure that the culture has expanded but on the other hand expansion brings complexity to border control and is risky i mean nobody is going to want a group of isis people just moving in whenever they want i mean geez
the second guy has a vision of the future that reminds me of people that believed we would have flying cars in the 80s also hes against borders but wants to track where people are and are going at all times looking forward tio his gubernatorial race
i hope the first lady that went up is safe lol
lol the dude so no borders in 5 to 10 years open borders is an imaginary ideal it would be great but the world is not peaceful terrorism is happening all the time we need borders to prevent terrorism fuck the drugs
fuck my wall na na na bitch fuck your feelings
i know you probably wont read this steven but the act of literally building the wall is a stupid idea  to be clear i am not against the idea of stricter illegal immigration control but am against the literal building of a wall  for starters most illegal immigrants come to america through boats  building a literal concrete wall wouldnt stop the majority of illegal immigration  an actual border wall would be a massive waste of taxpayer money and not even stop the majority of illegal immigration   a much better idea would be to take a percentage of the millions even billions of dollars that it would take to build a useless concrete wall of that magnitude and invest that money into more military boats patrolling the seas  the waterways around the border need to be controlled a lot more than the land borders need to be  this is a much more effective solution to the illegal immigration problem than building a concrete waste of money  trump cited the success of israels border wall which was pretty dumb because israels border is marginally smaller than ours  for our purposes stricter naval control of our waterways and oceans would  cost much less and work much better than a concrete wall
ok ok ill bite on not building the wall sooo how about we compromise on stop supporting illegals with my tax dollars instead that way theyll just leave on their own
that guy was on to something instead of the wall one large xray beam the length of the boarder invisible wall just wait at the hospitals for people reporting radiation sickness great idea logical left
the second guy was on some deep star trek peaceful nazi doped up on some next level weed  kind of vibe what the hell
wtf was that dude trying to say its build the wall change my mind not build the wall confuse my mind
gender wage gap is a myth changed my mind
build the wall
leroy seems like he has a lot of dirt under his rug
congratulations on 2 million subscribers
coming from new mexico and being of spanish decent the same as him why is it always the retarded new mexicans and not the ones who can speak right maga gotrumporcry buildthewall
and the mark of the beast has just been explained by that guy
america is so awesome  bro has a dream of becoming the mayor of nm  good for him
lol stevens face at the end perfectly expressed my sentiments
this was so hard to watch
that guy who wants to be the governor of new mexicio is possibly the dumbest man to ever talk to stevenmeaning theres a good chance he could be elected there 
the pain is trying to be nice to idiots
been in new mexico since 1560s lmaooooo
i dont like the mental image of a borderwall but i like all the safety and the falling rate of crime that comes from having one
leroy seems like a nice guy with a good heart but boy is he misinformed and he is jurassic lee way out of the scope of what reality really is i mean i dont think he even understands the magnitude of what hes trying to imply there thats in sane have someone walk through a scanner and write a written letter of why theyre there he  talks about not believing in borders but yet having someone to go through a scanner with an electronic number and have a written letter of why theyre there he makes no sense at all  build the wall magamovement trump2020
cover up that ladys nametag please
i also wanted to ask you what are your thoughts on legalizing cannabis
the wall would be the biggest waste of money ever heard of underground tunnels boats and airplanes the money spent on the wall could used somewhere else that actually can curb illegal immigration
gary busey or guy number 2 for the next us president
crowder is the cunt type
at first i thought why are you blurring the ladys face everyone always shows their face on this segment self censorship to play youtubes game then i realized oh snitches get stitches and this is for safety
oooo this is gonna be a good one
build a wall no crack down on immigration yes
why dont we go after the employers that give jobs to undocumented workers if you dont give them jobs they wont come same with drugs quit buying them and they wont bring them
so an xray border when i heard that i lost my shitedit wouldnt an xray border cost more than a physical wallsmh
what percentage of illegal immigrants commit crimes ummm100 because otherwise they wouldnt be called illegal immigrants lol
i believe in a stronger border and stronger border control but i dont believe a wall will stop much illegal immigration happens everywhere but i feel its strongest right now in visas these people fly into the country on a work visa and then just never leave thats a very popular way to illegally immigrate if someone can give any ideas on how to stop that from happening let me know
this 90 day fiance bs needs to go tooi have 2 young stupid girls  i work with who are both right now using the court systems to get out of 90 day marriages that they fell forthe one guy beats up the girl now it cost us more money and they will probably remain here enough of this craziness iys dumb
i need an hour
the not comfortable woman that sat down  obtw the guy was an idiot
i am still waiting to travel fast with the flying car i was promised half a century ago
these people you talk to crowder unbelievably stupid its really sad i like the look you gave at the end says it all
a databasa
the wall wont stop illegal immigrationno but it will reduce it by a massive amount between 6073 according to some studies which is the goal reducing illegal immigration and getting our immigration system under control which would allow more people to come here legally once everything is fixedso it seems to me that a wall is nothing but good news from this point of view
forget the wall build a giant x ray scanner to scan for id tags lmfao
you may of just got this lady killed
how in the fuck are you going to tax an illegal immigrant second guy ah doesnt know shit ah you know ah
is that the van you guys travel in lol
the second person made no argument
wet should keep the death penalty change my mind
rip x
geez this was abnormally hard to watch
link to the crime statistics he was saying at 638
i agree with the woman im sure like most immigrants me included when she goes through customs she goes through secondary it takes hours to get through customs there are no guarantee that you can get through many immigrants will be afraid to go to the wall the wall will be institutionalized im not about that
leroy not the brightest bulb in the box
lmao that face at the end
drone monitored border problem solved
dude just one interview and a crazy man at that give us more content
i lost so many brain cells listening to the guy in the white shirt
was that second guy high  he was fucking clueless  he wants to be governor  im surprised steven didnt burst out laughing 
governor of nm fat chance kid you dont have 2 brain cells to rub together oh waitmaybe he does have a chance
that guys completely insane
yes your face at the end of that says it all utterly brainwashed id be interested to know his iq i bet its not anywhere near triple figures
so does crowder want a wall fr or hes just doing it for the show
that guy is retarded
wtf this video was short af
the guy was an idiot
does anybody know the link to the go green global guys recorded video  i want to watch crowders facial reactions to him talking
hey jaredimprinting over the fannypack is not a look that most people can pull offbut by god you sunnuva bitch you did it also that spanish dude is bout as sharp as a bowl of marbles xray border uh i know it was on the spot but jeezus think before you speak man
im not sure people who have the option to skip taxes would willingly pay taxes
holy shit the dude with the white shirt is dumb you cant tax mexicans and put their money back in the economy to begin with these fresh immigrants will be poverty line for years after their arrival second thats already happening mexicans work and buy goods and use services which puts their money back in the economy spanish guys opinion is probably the stupidest thing ive heard all day
this one was a little boring
why dont we crack down on businesses a people who pay illegal immigrants
that last guy was pretty chill
just pissed my pants
that guy is so stupid lol 
talk about cheap pricks what about the 14 minutes of wasted time you stole from however many thousand people
just look at the berlin wall lets see if ours will come down by the end of this century
they shouldve built a wall back in 1550 to keep this guys ancestors out
some sort of xray scanner 
thank god for water borders
what a friggin idiot that guy is dumber than a box of rocks
lol so he wants us to lojack everyone
great wall of america
that guy says he is spanishas in from spainpffft
hospitals in california are shutting down left and right because illegals go there and get medical treatment and then never paying the bill what this does is make it so that citizens who need emergency services will have to travel that much further to reach the medical treatment as a result people die because treatment is to far away  this is a huge problem that needs to be addressed among the plethora of problems illegal aliens bring to our country
first of all this guy is not what he claims maybe half spanish decent but my mother is of mexican descent and im of a more fair complexion my father being of german descent additionally this guy has a very strong accent either grew up in mexico or a hispanic ghetto also his ideas and grammar are beyond ludacris an electronic id and x ray border what kind of 1984 bullshit is that then again maybe hes just sophistic and pseudo intellectual enough to provide the kind of rhetoric necessary to become a politician its not like the plebians respond to patrician dialogue
these people can vote ladies and gentleman
steven with the jim halpert face at the end lol
damn mexicans and their not registering for the xray boarder they outsmartn us errrrrtime
spain no dude look at you no smh
the mexican guy who says im not mexican but from spain is definitely mixed with amerindian he just has a big stick up his ass about it and what hes suggesting the xray scanner andor implantation of tracking chip without the wall is impossible besides these things would be useless they can remove the chip this guys an idiot
xray border
anyone notice the fake mexican adds ah or uh to the end of half the words he says
wtf did i just watch
the guy in the 10 min mark he said we should remove borders all in all but then his suggestion to monitor who enters and leaves the country is exactly like a port of entry and port of entries are pointless without borders so
the second guy thinks star wars is around the cornerbut honestly how does a dirt poor honduran man get a virtual id
im hispanic i come from 2 illegal parents i was raised to believe i was mexican i belived the democrat party was for the people n then i grew up  n i started paying taxes in ca i was paying 800 a week in taxes i was like wtffffff thats when i realized there was a problem  i started researching info on our govt and the parties running this country thats when i realized im not mexican im american im a hard working american getting taxed up the ass to support illegal immigrants and antiamerican partydemocrats  i realized the democrats use minorities to stay in power as of today i will be dam if i let any one call me mexican i say im hispanic yes but im an american build the wall n fight to keep america free and great  trump 2020
my god this is amazing the spanish guy lollllll also crowder you should give us an option not a student anymore to contribute to you and your show in an amount that is less than 99
i hope that dude does become governor of new mexico one day hes young and passionate he has the true spirit of america within him he will learn and grow and become a lot wiser by the time he becomes governor because he has an open mind im glad people like him exist not everybody has to have all the answers but his attitude is a good one for finding the answers if you see this i hope you do it one day dude
that second guy is either crazy or has a sub80 iq was this really the best content you got out of that day of filming im not interested in changing the mind of someone who literally cant hold a coherent thought for even second
you can tax them and try to make money off them but the reality is they send billons of us dollars back to mexico  taking it out of our economy
the second guy has no clueand he thinks he is going to be governor of new mexico lmao
personally i want strick immigration control and deportation of illegals but i think a wall may be effective but i do not think it will be cost efficient im pretty sure it will impare the cartels more than illegals not that im complaining
that dude better not be the future governor of new mexico people who really believe in a borderless society have been brainwashed enough that the nwo doesnt have to push their agenda anymore
build a xray wall maga
wait that was it that seemed to end quickly
whos going to pay for it though i dont disagree with the wall i think it would be a good idea as long as tax payers dont have to pay for it
that last guy is what happens when you give everyone a participation trophy and abolish grades in school
considering 8090 of narcotics sold in america and canada come via mexico  stopping any of that is a good then when you consider the social issues created by them
homie you need to stay in school bro oh hell no im not voting for you for governor of new mexico ill run against you vato
an xray border is this a real thing or is this a star treck reference
yeah lets usea scientifical ray that should do the trick
xray borders bro
vote leroy
build it we have too many illegals and its not fair who have done it mostly right  should still learn or start learning english before you get here  to let them come hereworse were obamas bullshit policies that were giving benefits to illegals
simple question why does it have to be a wall between us and mexico there aint no wall between us and canada or barely any other borders in the world with a few exceptions what function does the wall have keeping people out is a wall or any sort of structure without supervision 247 gonna keep an entire country at bay let alone the cartels if they wanna smuggle shit over they will succeed no walls gonna stop a billion dollar drug empire my conclusion the wall wont do shit except costing a lot of money
nibba talkin about xrays lmao
what surprised me most was your cool demeanor with the xray wall dude pretty soon some you tuber will put out a man owns himself video jeeze that was nuts
450 its going back into their economy because they send all of our money to mexico without borders a country isnt a country 1220 ever hear of cocaine i can agree with pharmaceuticals being miss used but thats a different story
that last guy said uh at the end of every other word
131 illigal immigrants dont want the wall 
ask them in the future if they would live in a house with no walls people have differentiate thoughts if they think its something they will never be impacted by
i have no idea how you could keep a straight face steven
that ending shot 
man these are one of my favorite youtube series do fat acceptance is fundamentally  wrong change my mind 
quick question if you are in the united states illegality isnt that a crime itself and if so that would be 100 of the illegal immigrants in the united states are committing crime so you cant say they are not doing anything wrong if they are in the united states
yea whispering into a microphone is really smart lmao
leroy is on drugs
the guy from santa fe was basically describing now lol
no a 20 billion wall at a time where immigration is at net zero according to a pew studyno thanks its fiscally irresponsible and not practicalit would require us to tear though private land and the possibility of displacing americans on the wrong side of the border it is one of the least thought out ways to stop immigration
dub better than sub change my mind
no border no politicians
35 of the pop are illegals 37 commit all the murders did i hear that right why doesnt everyone know that stat that is a crisis
the leftist msms goal is make a populous of idiots
i love how you knew he didnt have an idea what he was taking about so you spared him an embarrassment
ok umm you cannot tax people that are unidentifiable and crossing illegally you gonna put a guard shack in the desert collecting taxes i think people do not understand the illegal part of illegal immigration
im not against having a wall its just the cost that worries me since estimates floating around are at least 10 billion some going as high as 70 billion is that worth it maybe but it might be better to save that and chip away at the deficit
everyone should know their is a wall already up fenced its just in very poor condition
off topic you mean every thing youve said not related to a wall or border enforcement
its the low iq parade
build the wall close borders to mexico and muslim countriesand everywhere elsethere no racism if you cant be adults about sharing this country then no one outside gets to come
that spaniard is not smart he wants a techno police state
what kinda cyberpunk shit was the second guy going on about
first
does anyone have any aleve
that last guy you talked to was nuts and had no clue about any of this stuff or how to solve the problems it was all ideological and faith in someone smarter being able to figure out a way to solve the problem using the virtue the guy decided had to be
whats up with the dudes shorts in the background early in the video grey shorts african american
1125 i dont want a border i want an xray border
i wonder if stephen regrets doing the first one of these  because hes gonna have to do them forever now
i always hear that building the wall is not going to stop them from coming in yet they vehemently even panicky scream out they are against it the truth is it will slow down illegal immigration significantly and they know it if it wont stop it it shouldnt matter  but when faced with reality that sets in so does the fear they will do and say anything to prevent itedit the argument has been its about the amount of tax payer money it would cost to build the wall though it is hard to get the exact number it is known that it costs taxpayers 100 of billions if taxes over a few years or in a single year point being we could build the wall one just one or two years would have the wall built also ineviatbable its not slowing down can you imagine the strain on our economy 10 more years how many walls could be built at what point is it enough where do we say enough is enough this is not something we can burden year after year
forgot to blur that id lol
i mightve just not been paying attention but how do i find full versions of this
it blows my mind that the guy who sat down is allowed to vote how can anyone with such stupid ideas be allowed to even survive without a caretaker
come on peoplelets give a hand of applause to the second male individual he might not be educated on political or news sites but he spoke right off of his mind and that takes guts even if your disagreeing with someone dont take that individual own character out of context my best friend is a liberal and i hate him for being left sided but when all set aside and whe playing fortnite we joke about everything and dont cared about each interest on trump or whatever
change my mind celebrity edition would be really interesting to watch
the second interview made me go crazy hes been an american his whole life but cant even talk correctly if he becomes the governor of nm dear god help us all pulling stats out of his ass
another guaranteed to go platinum
woops planes woops ladders woops boats lol
that hispanic dude had homework ideas than anyone he wants to put chips in people so they can be tracked it sounds like i prefer a wall in that case
not a good change my mind segment wish you wouldve tried again got some actual conversations on video and tied in the some of that first sitdown
that last second made my day
mastermind individuals  i can just see it now  dr evil hannibal lector and lex luther sitting around a table discussing this
so the second guy wants to implant a digital chip into every single possible immigrant and install a 2500 mile long xray scanner because he thinks a brick wall is too inefficient just making sure i cant wait till he runs for governor of nm
2nd guy is just begging to have an id chip implanted into his neck because travel will be way faster
hahaha the guy is just to way out there we need to digital tag illegal immigrants and have an xray border after he finds his masterminds
like ur argument agree with everything excerpt the wall why because it is a waste of money that they could just fly over itplain climb over it and by tunnel this wall will be a wall worth billions of dollars with no actual good today technology to actually make it offective it would be better to just put more people securing it
an xray border  lmaoof ill teleport there with my ray gun  wtf
just tax themyea thats really gonna stop or helphard to tax when they come in illegally and are undocumentedxray borderfuture governor of new mexico lol wew
i disagree with building the wall we should invade mexico and clean it up the way we have the middle east makemexicogreatagain and theyll stop wanting to come here en masse
trump 2020 build that wall 
imagine if hildabeast was prez
i completely support trumps wall i do the buildthatwall hashtag and i support that but i personally think that a wall might be little extreme i think background checks and other ids should be so much more tighter to secure the border now i understand that they will still hop the fence and still get in easy i honestly think we should do what north korea does for their border with south korea land mines and dangerous explosives to give these people that want to illegally immigrate the idea that illegally immigration is wrong and they either legally immigrate or dont immigrate at all many might disagree but i also support the wall because of what the great wall of china did for them they built it to stop the mongolians from coming in and murdering people setting fire to villages and raping women and that worked and the wall is still they today a wall will help america but sometimes i think it might be extreme some might think that my idea of land mines is awful and probably will make the situation worse opinions are opinions i respect yours if you respect mine
to go into canada from most countries you dont need a visa only a passport if someone really can not get a visa all they need is a passport fly to canada and walk into the us no wall to avoid drugs from crossing lets be real tons of drugs cross everyday some may cross under or over the current call the the biggest problem is that  is a demand if there is a demand the product will get to the place of demand they main drug issues is the us needs to prevent drug use the wall will not fix anything it is just a big expense on the tax payers and can be used on public spending like drug prevention
damn this guy is an idiot
okay this guy i thought was just a troll
this is classic lmfao love the face at the end
build the wall
how about believing that immigration policies be strong but also believing that a wall in the 21st century is laughable in terms of actually keeping anyone out and considering the enormous cost immigration is very very important but lets honestly evaluate the feasibility that a wall is going to provide short of that wall being manned by armed guards every quarter of a mile it will never make an appreciable difference climb over tunnel under blow a hole through it etc the walls we have now have tunnels leading from tijuana mx to el centro ca and in order to apply countermeasures to those things it costs even more money were talking thousands of square miles and billions of dollars this isnt ancient china we can do better than a fucking wall
jose the idiot cant form a sentence
a long continuous wall would not work a wall cutting through tall ass mountains and border communities and nearby ecosystems harms the environment plus costs shitton of cash also there are places where illegal immigrants dont really cross and putting a wall there is really useless having a solid wall just for the sake of blocking  visibility is  not really practical when electric fences drones trenches death traps and extreme weather works even better
what year does this guy think were living in
hes has some dumb thinking
the second guy was just painful to listen to
the kid in the white shirt is an absolute moron
xray borders lol
how about the us just conquer mexico and make them a territory problem solved it wouldnt be hard to take them over their military sucks balls
what the hell is going on with the back of that spanish dudes head is that just some gross ass fat
its always amazing when people shut down ideas to prevent a problem but then never have one to substitute current one
illegal immigrants help the economy
build the wall and fire all the rapist and murderers into it with a catapult
the mexican dude wants to put stars on their chests and make them stand out
electronic id sounds like the end timespeople are giving up freedom for security i dont want the gov  or anyone knowing where i am 247
if were literally talking about building a wall between usa and mexico id change your mind by pointing out the absurd cost for something that would minimally reduce illegal border crossings its 2018 not 13th century china trying to keep out mongolians on horseback however immigration reform i am in favour of for all countries i think legal immigration should be made more efficient and easier and illegal immigration should be cracked down on
talking to the 2nd guy was the biggest waste of time ever lmao good episode tho
1021 this dude gets increasingly more cringey
dont build the wall  change my mindi didnt really learn anything from this video as the arguments on the dont build the wall side were pretty dreadful and poorly thought out plus it was a relatively short video so i want to learn more from people who think a wall should be built my thinking is this please correct me if im wrong1 according to homeland security it will cost around 216 billion us dollars to build not including maintenance which was backed up by politifact thats a pretty high opportunity cost especially when you think of the crumbling infrastructure and the troubled education system in many parts of america that could desperately do with more funding despite what trump says the mexican government are not going to pay for it and have officially stated on numerous occasions that they arent going to how can you justify the cost2 forgetting the cost and the time it would take to build its hard to see how much of an effect it would actually have on illegal immigration and the drug trade walls arent exactly the most perfect way of stopping people from transporting goods or even crossing the border people have been using tunnels for quite a long time and this would still happen even if there was a wall as for transporting drugs people could easily just throw it over or use a drone or somethingeditfirst of all whats with the hostility of so many of you i just stated my opinion and said i wanted to learn more about it and ive already been called a dumbass and told that i should be strung up on the wall it seems that some of you dont understand the difference between a countrys government fiscal budget and their current account saying that the country will pay for it with trade doesnt make sense unless they put massive tariffs on all imports and mexico dont put any tariffs on us exports ie not going to happenalso if there was a wall there do you not think that they would just find another way to get in a large proportion of us illegal immigrants come via plane and overstay their visas building the wall would just lead to an increase in the number of people doing thisa lot of you have quoted that illegal immigration costs the us over 100 billion dollars a year please say where you got this statistic from as its wrong according to almost every source ive checked
intellectually incompetent just wow
scienfifical xray border invented by mastermind individuals
an xray station that will run basically 247 it honestly would be cheaper to build a wall im just sayin
is that eddie bravos brother he makes the same amount of sense
scientifical
httpsimgurcomag8z9jlhmeme this immediately
nothing about this surprise me im not surprised that the lady is more afraid of the illegal immigrants then the police and im certainly not surprised with leroy hes a freaking moron he gave me a headache
build the wall but on the southern border of mxico
are you actually building the wall  d
hey man i didnt know you was gonna be in austin for the change my mind gender i would of came out and chilled with ya i live in austin
annex mexico change my mind
steven reminds me of tom hanks only smarter
fuck you crouder
wants xray scanner  doesnt want a wall to force them to have to go through the scanner
i love your videos but you could get that lady into trouble posting a video of her reporting dangerous people in her apartment complex you should really consider removing her video rather than just blurring her face out
hillary is a criminal change my mind
libtards cant come up with one logical arguement libtards are the most angry illogical people ever please use logic please build the wall trump 2020 oh and btw all colors are equalthe only real racists are american blacks they are sooooo racist
holy fack how does crowder not bust out laughing at mr xray border guy  that guy needs to lay off the coffee andor lsd
i vote we build the wall around wyoming to aint got no beef with them but i feel like theres somthin going on out there no way they just stare at clouds and day dream they have been planning somthing i can feel it
i one day plan to be the governor of new mexico  hilarious  good luck with that  dumb dumb  
that dude was way too ahead of himself
wow the last guy smokes a lot of weed
the governor of new mexico
the people in this change my mind were just as stupid as the typical leftys that crowder deals with but way more lackadaisical and less threatening which just made for a video that was hard to watch more liberal obliteration less poorly opinionated shmucks please
where did you shoot this video kind of reminds me of austin
leroy is on meth
please try and post change my minds that have literate guests when you have two people who cant form a proper sentence it really makes the video unentertaining
that xray boarder sounds soo cool
nothing kills brain cells faster than listening to a leftist explain their position
the only legitimate borders are private property borders change my mind
rip x wait wrong video ill let myself out
i liked the 1st one she was wrong but i get where she was coming fromeditalso im mixed with the wall i think it would have beneficial effects but i also think we could employ vets in the area to help protect border kill two birds with one stone on the other hand building the wall could make construction jobs so i honestly have no idea
2 words auto turrets
taco iq on full display in this video deport now
that last guy wants to bag and tag illegals with a rfid like a dog
that guy is dumb
waste of time watching this
yes been waiting so long for this one
holy fuckin shit listening to that guy is painful idiot
100 of illegal immigrants have committed a crime
did that guy just say that we should all just be labeled in such way that scanners would be able to get readings from us at any given place to automatically report our whereabouts to a government agency listen if you thought that was a great ideia get help and by help i mean a psychiatrist
holy shit it was right in front of our faces the entire time just make them citizens genius
build it
the one guy cracks me up  we shouldnt have a wall but we should know who comes into the country and when  yeah you kind of need controlled border crossings for that
i dont want a wall or borders at all i want an xray pin code log in system to track people and what they are doing in the country liberals will become more conservative than actual conservatives just to win arguments
if youre blurring her face maybe do the id card as well
omg this guy hes talking to is mentally ill glad he ended the conversation
wow haters gonna hate lol
was that guy speaking some kind of code or something 
im canadian and im against illegal immigration however this whole wall thing just seems gimmicky to me
god some of these people cant even put together a coherent sentence
i had no idea that steven crowder supported this
0507 im not mexican im spanish as in spaniard spanish
i didnt like this change my mind at all
theres no solution to the problem that does not involve1 a physical barrier of some kind2 absolute control over who can crosswithout those two things nothing else can or will workas a regular crosser a hightech xday digital system would be awesome but damned expensive to implementwait times at san ysidro busiest in the nation vary from 14 hours right now the process involves scanning your passport then a quick visual interview with a cpb officer takes less than 3 minutes  once you get to the counter the bottleneck is caused by a severely large number of people trying to cross legally at any one location and a small number of border agents processing entries
these people that guy in the white shirt wants the mark
i dont want a wall as i am writing this i am on a bus passing by the existing wall that is already along the border there are walls there is already a wall i am not saying this to be poetic i live in a border city and i am legit taking the bus which hapens to pass right next to the mexican wall i wish that the current border patrol was better reinforced better training and that more jobs were open for them i dont support ilegal immigration but as a future public education teacher i feel the money that might be used for the wall could be used to better our public education system
im not mexican im spanish my family has lived in new mexico since the 1550swhat
that new mexican is a dumbass
hey lets just microchip all the people everyone and ill be the governor or nm no deport them all idgaf
that look at the end is exactly how we all felt watching that dude talk
this dude is hilarious
i think that most latin american are against the wall because of a misunderstanding of what trump said its okay that you americans want to protect your country however i dont know if the wall its gonna the best way to fix the illegal migration issue
obama was a bad president  change my mind
we have to get a bunch of masterminds to figure it out this dude xd
the future governor of new mexico puts an a on the end of words that dont end in a
this guy is an idiot he says he isnt mexican or hispanic but yet he says his ancestors lived in new mexico since the late 1500 give me a break and build the wall
the look says it all
these people like to shake alot
xray borders the people on the right want immigrants to come in via legal channels and left want to implant chips in them like dogs and fry them with radiation to track their movements for taxation somehow im the evil one for my border wall and limited immigration views
no more dual citizens in government positions change my mind
people born in the us do everything they can to avoid paying taxes that idiot thinks illegals are going to step up and pay taxes idiot
that dude is off his rocker what the hell was he on
yes oooooooohhhhhhh shit i screamed throughout my house i love this series
lousy change my mind not crowders fault though interviewees are just too dumb and too inarticulate painful to listen to id prefer a radical sjw that can actually articulate their loathsome ideas over these two
be chipped and traced by the government everywhere you go because a wall is too oppressive
civil war is coming
they both looked like they were on drugs
trump  obama  change my mind
hes against the wall but his idea would literally require the builiding of a physical wall mind  blown
i plan on being the governor of new mexico  this kid is a moron he wants to essentially wants to rfid chip everyone so that you can be tracked via xray checkpoints thankfully he is stupid enough and narcissistic enough to sit down and run his mouthensuring that he will never make office
that second guy was hard to listen to hah
the shark music xd lol
the wall is racist hillary 2020
that spanish guy was high as fuck
this guy is fucking retarded
the video ive been waiting for
majority of illegal immigrants are honest people they just dishonestly broke the law coming into the us illegally 
these people were hard to understand
all that they know how to say is its racist well then we better not put anyone in jail for any reason if they are any kind of minority just let them kill and maim let them sell drugsrape let them do whatever the hell they want and you cant put anyone in prison then because cant punish the class if some committing the same type of offense gets away with it then everyone shouldlet all minorities out of prisons today  i also want to see these people who are against it take in a few illegal immigrants into their home for a few days now were not going to tell you anything about them not even their name but theyre just going to come in and sleep in your childrens room tonight while you live there as well when you can make them dinner and everything too because thats exactly what youre saying you want to do so let him move in dont ask any questions not allowed to frisk or check them in anyway just let him in your house tonight with your kids and let them sleep over itll be funevery one are  just wonderful people
the left wants open borders plain and simple they are ignorant to the true costs of illegal immigration
i wish we could talk about why these people leave their countries what is happening in these places that people are willing to risk their lives and their kids lives to get out of their home countries
i think that guys bringing drugs across the border
the wall wont stop all illegalls but will stop alot of it 
man hearing these people out is painful   thats my mental gymnastics for the evening
why cant we all have safe spaces  even nationally
hes been watching too much altered carbon
i can honestly say i did not like this video and it had nothing to do with you wanting to build a wall you just didnt have any worthy adversaries nobody really interesting came to talk to you this stinks i really wanted to see a healthy debate between you and some foolhardy sjw trying to prove their point i hope you bring up this topic again somewhere else
you mean to tell me the people on the left havent thought it through well im just shocked
nice vans
1315 bro i almost died choking from laughter im not even kidding dude fuck you i was gasping for air for like 2 minutes i literally went from to
hahaha xray border  i respect this dude for debating but he needs to articulate his arguments a little better
i got your video from prageru of this video for an ad
 my families been in new mexico since the 1550s around there  wtf lol so he is a native american descent
the left portrays themselves as reasonable and logical but just look at the way they casually insult crowder
this dude is living in the future dog
drugsa pasta fasta yearsa basea
leroy seems out there but hes more well balanced than most leftists and democrats i know
very few come over the boarder most come by student visa and never leave
those losers in their cars should grow some balls and take a seat otherwise keep your gross mouth shut
they want the wall to keep us in
this guy at the end is trying to tag people like dogs 
the wall is a waste of money building it and repairing over the years people will find a way to go through
if that guy wants to be governor of new mexico he better never say xray border again lol
you shouldnt hey high before a political debate like that guy did lmfao
his face at the end like wtf just happend
he is debating  mocrochiping everyone alive to tell who is who so no one is charged illegal when they are honest vs only mexicans i personally know more people good and bad that work their asses off just to survive i disagree with the chip i dont understand his argument but i also disagree with a wall we are based on immigration  there for if you are willing to put in and do your jobs you are welcome if not we got this sorry we cant help you join the freedom states and stand for it or stay where you are we are simple minded yet have the best ideas in the world the wall is a fact for infantry  but not what we stand for time to stand up again and stop being liberal bitches 10 commandments love thy neighbor bottom line
do a change my mind on the space force
no borders  hes full of referred beens and pants full of shit
need to blur her id card
whats up with the bottled drink with a plant inside it
1315  that expression
another uneducated college kid who cant put together two complete sentences
at first i was thinking of disliking it and not watching cuz i myself am a immigrant but ive been a fan for awhile and this wont change anything your a great person with great ideal but today you didnt change my mind 
so his preference instead of a wall is some sort of barrier that would only allow people to enter in through an official gate with legal documentation okay
trump will be the first president in space spaceforceone
apparently the people who take the time and effort to come here legally dont count at all
i also love that the last person wants people to go through the scanners for the id but wouldnt that necessitate a wall so that they dont just skip the line and the scanners and then come in and do what they want and if we eventually turn into a borderless world how do we tax people so we can continue to fund the government and provide all the services the democrats are insisting we provide everyone do they get charge a certain amount for however long theyre in the country like if youre here for a quarter of the year then you have to pay a quarter of the taxes he really just needs to think that one through thoroughly to see how idiotic he sounds
majority of immigrants come by plane on non immigrant visas and then overstay walls havent worked since the fucking dark ages guarantee ifwhen they build that thing the percentage difference in illegal immigration will not be worth the cost of building it
an electronic id  is he referring to something like a mark of the beast  be weary everyone what you convince yourself into
that guys on the drugs coming in look if his family has been in nm since the 1500s he would be mixed in enough not to have a spanish accent
that dude is an inept fool
it kills me when people say only get rid of the criminals do people honestly not realize that every single illegal immigrant bar none is a criminal so i hate to burst your bubble but if youre saying only get rid of the criminals while im saying deport every single illegal were saying the same thing whether you like it or not
he kinda sounded like leeroy jeeeenkinss
the problem is not america is fighting immigration the problem is they are fighting corruption on the mexican governments part and even low key american involvement on occasion the mexican government is narco and work with narco obamas ass did not mind helping them out with fast and furious he did lose jack
got an ad for change my mind on this vid not sure if that made you money lol
702 guy in back ooft
i was speaking about this with my mother and she was concerned about the people that are trying to escape poor living conditions ie the middle east i am not an immigrant myself but how long is the process to enter legally if people need to find a place to take refuge immediately is it too difficult to get in quickly im just wondering if there is an alternate solution to the problem such as making admittance easier or safe houses where refugees can stay while waiting to qualify for a visa a wall will work but it only appears to be a shortterm solution at least thats my take on it
i suspect they werent extremely excited about the people who participated in this one this segment is usually a bit more serious so talking to people with nothing serious to say only works if its funny generally in support of what they are trying to do though ben shaprio quickly adapted to the intellectual dark web credo of open discussion but its tougher to stay on that track in comedy
ben shapiro should run for president change my mind hehehehe
backpack guy must be in or recently graduated from an american university
the difference in iq is in plain sight for everyone to see dont let these people in even legallyfrom a mexican
damn he had to do it
im in santa fe and i wont vote for the dumb ass
the guy is one of those people that you just shouldnt argue with  let him just talk and talk and make enough of a fool of himself and pray that most people that watch hear the foolishness
was this guy high seriously the only person that had the balls to sit down was this guy
this wall needs to happen just so i can see people fall off it and the amazing shit they do to drill through it and such pure fucking awesomeness go full tilt tower of babble on this shit please
this kid is a idiot
when is steven going to start citing his sources id love to see how creditable his crime stats are
oh steven that was something else bro that last guy wow what the hell kind of drug was he on maybe the next governer of new mexico lmao
my dad is a spanish immigrant who came the legal way build the wall aint racist it is just logical
shout out to jared for keeping an eye on crowder had to double check to see you all were carrying
cancer the free thought guy just gave me cancer i avoided cigarette for 46 years and for what 5min of pure ear rape and now i have cancer
build the wall with your ass steven crowder you bitch hahahaha  what a good suggestion
the second guy is so full of shit says hes a spaniard whose family has been in new mexico since the 1500s he wouldnt even pass as a castizo and he speaks with an accent lol
build the wall deport all illegals end birthright citizenship
that was hilarious xray borders congrats on 2 mil check out my new political channel 
come on stevencrowder you cant generalize mexicanamerican culture for one stupid hispanic lady  its unreasonable to assume we fear each other just because of that  thats low for you man
this guy crowder interviewed is a fucking idiot
he wants people to have rfid tags like dogs does he know he is promoting the mark of the beast i am not merging with computers just tax em you know make the legal and tax em sound plan fucking dork
israel is our greatest ally change my mindsteven wont do it because he will get thoroughly demolished by real america firsters end zionist occupation of our government america for the americans
if most of the illegals crossing from mexico were white there would be no debate about this when nonwhite people are involved in anything the left draws the race card and makes it a partisan issue
how high was that guy dude was talking xrays and running for governor
please tell me that guy was high if he is being completely serious maybe he has bad anxiety or something he didnt make too much sense the things he says he agrees with make them pass the test give them ids make them pay taxes thats what we are trying to do dude we are only trying to kick out the noncompliants
the best way to tax everyone both rich and poor illegal and legal is with a gst tax which is common in other western countries
wow the second guy is thick
no just no the wall is an absurd waste of money see this is where we differ and where i wish you were more of a libertarian the majority of illegal immigrants get to this country legally by planecarboat and over stay their visas trump is an egomaniac and needs to let go of this pet project called the wall please do more research bro this is a sad one to see from you i respect you but the wall dude come on
708 anybody today now a days  creates crimes wtf  what a stupid fuck stick  good lord
i dont care who comes here as long as they come here the right way
hahaha the look on stevens face when he said xray  that dude has been reading some science fiction books
i havent even watched the video but 1 for that guy rocking the death from above 1979 shirt
these should really be named ill change your mind there really isnt any openness on any of these shows to the change my mind
build the wall and the space wall
do fat acceptance
all these racist european white immigrants need to go go to their own countries and let the latinos take back their land
ive been overwhelmed by illegals at 20 percent of the jobs ive had to where they gang up and only speak spanish this also occurred when i had 17 illegal immigrants living next door in a one bedroom next to me this is america wtf
the second person literally contradicted his own point he says yeah tax em all but borders are going to be a thing of the past and people can go anywhere they want how do you tax people if you dont know whos coming and going
are we ignoring that he said his families been in new mexico since 1550
were gonna build an xray wall and make the robots pay for it
blurs face  doesnt blur id hanging on neck
we truly are doomed theres no hope
so that last guy talking is really a far stretch  i think that idea is worse in the wall
the spanish dude basically described a 1984like police state thats par for the course for leftists
that guy definitely seemed off
why dont the democrats give a shit about the millions of american fathers that are imprisoned for the personal usage of drugs where is everyones outrage over real legal citizens of the us being torn form their families into a jail cell why is all of the concern for people that crossed the border illegally knowing full well the consequences it has and being a burden on tax paying unemployed and hardworking citizens
at 443 he says let them in then tax them and make money off them wrong only a small percentage would make enough to be taxed most would be undereducated low end labor most would likely wind up relying on some sort of public assistance costing money instead of contributing
that dude adds uh to the last word of almost every sentencethats all i got from that dude
build the wall we have our own poor and sick that need taking care of here the only things these open borders nuts are inadvertently highlighting are the utter failures of the countries these illegals are fleeing
the wall is dumb but please help immigration is going out of control the wall aint gonna do anything you heckin know if someone is dedicated to coming to the us they wont stop
damn you steven i was just about to go to bed damn you and your high quality uploads
that dudes like speech patternmade me dismiss like literally anything he said
that first guy was retardedlike mentally ill to the point of no return
my man said my family been in new mexico since the 1550s
bitches on my dick because i look like jesus
xrays and sharks with frickin laser beams attached to their heads
terrible counterarguments im like  embarrassed for the guy lol
liberals are stupid
building a wall is stupid we need to build a white picket fence instead 15 feet high made of steel with a 20000 volt charge although its the amps that kill you
people will still come in through the sea and plus the wall still needs maintain costs
new mexico elect this guy
really only 13 minutes why crowder why
the second guy lets just say i dont even know what to say
build the wall with your ass bitch  lmao that was great
the wall wont stop all illegal crossings is the dumbest thing i have ever hearda bandage doesnt always stop all the bleeding either but it can slow it to a manageable level so you can get to the hospital shit my 4 year old gets it for fuck sake 
so what he basically wants is to rfid every person in the world and have an electronic border to read the rfids and of course read their minds to know why they are coming since if you dont have border enforcement they obviously are not going to be filling out paperwork as well as rfid readers in the center of large metropolis to track them afterwards my word some people really have no clue
these people are dumb change my mind
the last guy 
949  this guy is insane  he wants no wall but tracking people 1984and steven cruz was a never trumper he never wanted a wall
dude you need common sense background checks on the people you debate with
2 million subscribers i have been here since under 200k subs funny the growth compared to the budget of some other media outlets great job congrats
hold me to this but i believe trump is about to surprise us all and get a new fan base after all of this even a businessman knows weve all been fleeced for years beyond my birth and its the fault of ill voting and ill elected officials
steven does seem milder in the more recent change my mind videos i like it
i honestly feel like they should stop all the nonsense i feel like its shouldnt be built because its a waist of alot of money all that money could be used to better causes for instance in schools to help familys feel more safe when sending their kids to school and not just for schools but all that money could be used to help veterans that cant work and help elderly people
this guy has good intentions but i dont think he understands what hes asking for or what it will take to do that
some sort of x ray scanner mind control alien cloning device
xray boarders electronic tagging people in major cities and fast transportation across the border sounds expensiveyou know what would be cheaper
re that last guy so borders are going to be a thing of the past because we can just install an invasive surveillance police state to track everyone all the time and heavily tax lowincome loweducation lowskill people who currently do their level best to avoid being noticed by the authorities because the current system is too complicatedseems legit this plan will totally work out my every move being constantly tracked by the man isnt creepy and invasive at all as for trading the trackless labyrinth of the immigration process for the incomprehensible maze of the tax code and putting a large tax burden on people who are already experienced at living under the radar  and generally dont have much money anyway why theyll be thrilled to pay huge taxes and not resentful or evasive at all im sure this wont immediately backfire catastrophically and fall completely apart within seconds sarcas for the first lady i think i can see her position of being for border security but not a wall per se not saying i agree with it but i can understand her position and she may have forced me to refine my own since i dont have a ready answer for why my opinion is different good on her for sitting down and hashing it out like that
i would take further efforts to conceal that first womans identity i respect her character and honesty
oh lord this 2nd guy is retarded
leroy walked away triumphantly just knowing he killed it
leroy is an idiot
how are you going to make an xray gateway big enough to span the entire border without a wall and isnt the idea of digital passports just legal immigration why is this guy in favor of illegal immigration but then say you need to vet who is coming in with digital passports a written note and going through an xray in a legal process
sure cant string a sentence together but wants to be gov of nm noice
lets reck these mexicans
diddid that dude seriously sit down and suggest police state levels of surveillance on not just americans but the entire world in order to create worldwide open borders in which the one government can track your every move and thus in the process can control you let me follow that up by asking if he seriously thought that was a good ideaespecially as an idea to be presented in america the land of the free
was the first guy high his ideas are so ridiculous
heyyy holmes were all gonna be on a super fast hyper speedway yo u jus cant defeat my shtyle holmes we gonna be intergalactic traveling holmes super fast yo we dont need no shtinking borders
there is no deterrent right now worst case scenario if caught coming in illegally with kids is that you are held for a few weeks and your kids are held somewhere else for a few weeks then your kids get to stay and you are sent back to try again how about we start shooting in the face anyone caught crossing illegally that would deter people better than basically telling them to try again
sooo the stoner who sat down wants a microwave fence instead of a wall  ok we can do that
so their logic are noone should come in illegally but i dont want the wall because i dont want itwha 
this dude in the white shirt needs to stop watching hollywood movies
i love this series so much
1134  im a computer engineernone of what he said sounds practical let alone affordable he has little more than a lot of poorly thought out platitudes
build the wall with your ass
go green global  lol i almost sharted myself
we need to change the birther lawsan immigrant child who was born here in the us should not automatically get us citizenship just because they were born on us soil
it makes me happy to see leftist idealists that actually have a kind way of expressing themselves and actually thinking with a brain and not a phone then there are the shouters on the sidewalk
what are they putting into the system without a social security card how is that even possible lol so stupid these kids today dumb they already committed a crime they came into our country illegally that is a crime its on the books its been on the books for a long time its just never been enforced and now everyones in shock that is actually is
that guy sounds like a brain dead moron i hope to god he never becomes governor of new mexico
bahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahaoh shit this dude was serious
i always back you up but his is pushing it a bit crowder
stevens sign guy must make a lot of money
new mexico is my city
wall  separation from our brothers and sisters our collective ignorancewalls in our mind are what manifest into physical walls that further divide us on the outside love so much of your work crowder but you can go much further
get your green card and youll never have to worry about being deported ever again
the first lady was crazy
the guy in the white shirt wants open borders with an xray id    the double speak is mind boggling
lol that guy plans to be the governor of new mexico bwaahahahahahahahahahahaha
tear down all border fencesand build the wall
im not even surprised people really are this dumb he wants to track everyone who comes in the country with a chip and monitor where they go but no wall you get shit like this because people dont want illegal immigrants but they are afraid to express an opinion that agrees with trump
due to the open border houston is being completely ravaged the human trafficking and drug trade is just terrible
as usual finding people that cant speak properly and putting them in your segments find someone that can speak and show them demolishing you
hey steven  another good one  one thing  the first womans badge  need to blurr that as well 
yeah but it doesnt go back into our economy thats one of the problems they send it back to their economy my friend and also there is a tax loophole that is of course united states of americas fault however they take full advantage of getting a tax deduction for children who dont even live here and live in mexico and they make thousands and thousands of dollars off taxpayers backs thats just one reason dont even start me on the fact that we have veterans or living in the streets or in terrible conditions or the fact that we have our own poor children that we havent fed yet or the fact that there are poor people in this country who will take those jobs even though the democrats want you to think that they wont when youre starving youll take a few dollars no we dont make them citizens they broke the law you dont get rewarded for breaking the law no american yet that i know has got rewarded for breaking the law so why the hell should youplussss the fact that we have changed our culture for them even press 2 for spanish why why the f should i press two for anything
austin again u hav brass balls
if people arent willing to go to a legal port of entry for border crossing why would they allow themselves to be tagged like an animal  like hitting your head against a wall
you know that woman is going to get murdered now right
these people are retarded
that second guy is an idiot he shouldnt have sat down now everyone knows how stupid he is omg he is so stupid xray machines electrical monitoring bringing permission slips to enter the country his brain doesnt work too good
so i havent look up a huge amount of this but the thing that the wall could cause isnt even political on the contrary its environmental it could hurt quite a lot of wildlife there yes i know there is a fence still at the area the wall would be but animals can get through that while they couldnt get through a wall as easily im not taking sides im just letting you guys know about this i just found it interesting found out from my brother not ten minutes ago
leroy looks and sounds like hes on drugswhat a dumbass
we just need a few masterminds to figure out this xray border in a scientifical way and were all set
damn that guy with the camera is dumb 
haha that camera stare at the end was like something outta the office nice
ladders exist yay i win
that second person spanish guy is just really dumb talking in circles and not saying shit worth hearing
the dude he talked to was on either meth or coke really amped up
that hurt my brain
i fucking love these
i feel like people dont ever stop to think why immigrants are crossing the border illegally its ironic to me that the us wants to reach out to various countries to either eliminate terrorists who are killing civilians or just providing general aid with medicinefood but when it comes to us wanting to allow them in our country to escape the very hostile situations that we play a part in trying to resolve it seems like we suddenly dont want to help them i agree that we need to create better programs to allow immigrants to come here legally to expedite that process however many families do not have the time money or resources to wait months and months to come here legally a lot of these families are in danger of their lives and they just want better for themselves and their children think about it if your family and your children are starving andor in danger of losing their lives would you wait to come here legally or would you flee to seek safety
rays  yea xrays you need to study your rays mr crowder the x variety specificallythe xrays shall save us
build the wall deport them all the only let white people in
interview 2 this guy is so full of shit
that was the most polite way of telling someone to please gtfo haha
the wall wont do shit thats just dumb we should focus on bigger problems and better solutions plus the wall will cost billions of dollars and we will be in more debt than we already are so the wall is just plain dumb
hhahaha people are going to be able to travel super fast for super cheap within 5 to 10 years and there will be no borders wtf how stupid and gullible and uneducated or these immigrants this guy is in an idiot
xray boarder that guy is an idiot
2 million
the concept of walls and boarders is no more they say  i wonder if they would like to tear down the walls in the homes they live in
build the wall
as long as ca says if you were born here you get nothing in fact you give us what you have and if youre illegal you can get what everyone else is working for there will be migration and exploiting kids to get over in sd its a zombie land of drugged out bums because ca says come and well take care of you
i got an ad from crowder
an xray border sounds pricey maybe a wall would be cheaper
holy fuck that guy needs to lay off the meth
she genuinely asked how she could report the illegals i her apartment complex
end all entitlement programs and have mandatory everify watch how many illegal aliens leave
so only 2 people wanted to talk that last person was a waste of time
boy i hope new mexico is smart enough to not vote for this delusional fool
so hes going to want to run for the congress or senate in new mexico well if new mexico votes this kid in then new mexico youre screwed cuz he is dumb as a stump
the first lady was interesting  the second guy wants to bring on the mark of the beast or create a big concentration camp
i believe you should have blurred the lady more use a voice jammershe is a really easy person to recognise and she might be in trouble if someone who should not actually sees this video better safe than sorryplease do your outmost to further secure her privacy
omg pleaseplease stay in school
patrol the border with drones the us military and no welfaregovernment assistance unless you are a us citizen
why argue against something so rational
the wall would be bad for the environment
steven crowder is a cucklord
yeah i dont know if you thought this over very well over those 3 years buddy
nobody had anything productive to say lol
an xray border wtf
woof he was hard to listen to idk how you sit there silently for that long
steven i have historically been against the wall but trump has been so right on all his policy so far i am willing to give it a try
042 build the wall with your ass but wouldnt that be unnecessarily difficult imagine building it with nothing but your ass alone
love the change my mind videos
i loved the stare at the end that guy was pretty delusional
for anyone wondering what the song is playing at the start its pogo  boy  bear
call the computer engineers this guy has a plan he just needs some computer engineers
veganism is evil change my mind
that guy in the white t shirt needs mental help 
i dont think we should build a wall a minefield would be cheeper
these ignorant uneducated latinos make me feel ashamed of being a latino just like that parasite ana navarro from cnn i was dealt the wrong dam cosmic cards   also what surprised me is your stoic aproach to these social leeches i hope that wall is built soon you either follow the law and wait for years for a visa like the rest of normal humans or do something to change your shithole country instead of destroying a better one with you barbaric useless culture
70 of mexican immigrant families are on some sort of social assistanceso how is the govt gonna make money off them again
hey steven crowder  please come to memphis also when i saw the title i legit  screamed i knew someone was going to get hate during this video also  can you try to do live streams of these or put out more footage
im of mixed feeling on the wall they built an ugly add fence back in the 90s it didnt help i dont think that the wall could help the only way i could see it could help maybe is around arizona and new mexico border too many people die in the desert i do have a question for mr crowder any suggestions on people who stay passed their legal visa that counts for a high percentage of the illegal immigrants in the country
i support the idea of the wall in that it will prevent people that have no right to our country from entering it when there are safe legal ways to what genuinely hurts me is my environmental side i really love the natural sciences and a wall will be incredibly detrimental to migratory animals ie small mammals and reptiles i dont know what a solution to that is because this is a human matter but i just think its something to consider thoughts
1030 xray border  lol lets just give the border crossers radiation poisoning
thoughts on building a wall along the border with canada
lmfao fat latina bitch cant even speak english why is she here
first
build an xray wall 
well that was pointless
an xray border sounds dangerous  i dont want to give cancer to illegal immigrants i just want border restrictions  i think a brick wall would be cheaper
wow dude sounds like hes on meth or something ranting about stupid shit 100mph
500 i hate to break it to that guy but hes not spanish like he claims hes a mestizo hes part spanish but hes heavily native family going back 200 years can come from all over the place one lineage that far back cant lay claim to your ethnicity when the others deviate
in mexico second only to oil and surpassing even the tourism industry money sent back in 2004 totaled 166 billion a 28 percent increase over the previous year
that guy with the camerawow  what an idiot
we clearly need a big xray thingieyea thatll solve it
what a poor reflection of the new mexico education system
so the dude from spain wants location tracking tags implanted in all the brown folks sure lets do it
the guy in the white shirt is not very bright
my wife and i were rolling while that dude was talking stevens face at the end was the icing on the cake
that one guys idea about a digital wall is more frightening than an physical wall  hes talking government tracking
a huge portion of drugs comes directly from south america this is a fact for a very simple reason that reason is the climate and biomes there are conducive to making cocaine and marijuana opening borders allows for people to easily come through which means any person can what hes proposing is an extremely flimsy way for people to get through and allows some very dangerous people to get by very easily
freeloader here
the second guy is painful to watch i didnt think people could be that misinformed and dumb
build the wall with your ass wtf
wall is not to keep the people out it to keep the us injail one big fema camp
that last guy would blow that wall down if he couldthank you leeeeerooooooyyyyyy
sign me up for the xray electronic implant or whatever hes talking about i feel like a saw a youtube video about nwo with similar ideas plus thats exactly what illegals want to be tracked at any given time by the government they are taking advantage of
so he wants international ids enforced by what  an international government  with enough power to influence policy in my country  hell no  i dont want anyone outside of the us telling me what to do
okay whoever is watching his youtube channel must be extremely stupid
the left defends illegals by saying theyre fleeing violence and gangs well okay if you really believe that and you dont pick and choose who you let in what makes you think the gangs and violence wont come too now those people are still living in a violent gang infested city only its your city
the 2nd guy is ashamed of being mexican he says hes spanish from new mexico apparently his family has been breeding with other people from spain for 500 years in new mexico like many hispanics hes not proud of mexico why would you be while fleeing mexico all for a hand out respect american laws or get the fuck out
did this guy just say we can tax the people coming into this country illegally wtf thats the fucking problem we cant tax them because we dont know whos coming in when theyre coming in how much money they are making and what they are really even fucking doingwe have no clue whos  coming in you idiots so we cant tax them they are here illegally and undocumented
also 30 of the prison population are illegal that adds to the gang problem here in ca the the south siders and mafia work with he cartels and mexico since they will play ball since they have their relatives over here
building a wall and standing against illegal immigration is not related  a wall solves nothing and costs way too much money that could be invested in creating jobs education fighting hunger etc
wow this was a disappointing one not because of your crowder assholes to scared to sit down and the one guy who did x ray border
come to la
got cancer trying to understand how we x ray immigrants and put electric tags on them with no border lmao
you broke 2 million great work guys
wtf with the xray laser wall
mass deport illegals
i dont normally hurl blatant insults at people but wow that second guy was really stupid
i hate when people say it wouldnt keep them out so we shouldnt build it just look at israel and their wall it lowered illegal entrance to the country to almost nothing
please do a change my mind for i dont believe in white privledge and israel isnt an apartheid state
lmao leroy has been watching to much science fiction
should of told her to vote republican
are some intelligent people build the wall with your ass damn
here we go hey crowder can you come near my campus full sail university in orlando please these people need to have someone challenge them i try to and all they say is that i am a bigot and i have no temper after that i try
horrible video find better people
i had the same look steven  i think he just wanted a freecheap plug to his website that lady was nervous probably out of fear my last point is if this is the caliber of people coming in legalillegal buildthatwall 
lets be real liberals encourage illegal immigration because a demographic shift benefits the dems these anchor babies wont be voting republican in 20 years you can guarantee that
505 im not mexican im spanish my family lived here since the 1500s facepalm
you need a wall its good for both countries
build the wall build the wall build the wall
from someone whos from the uk is this wall thing serious i thought it was a joke im not that well informed on us politics but i thought the wall thing sounded so stupid i thought it was a joke like an actual physical wall
instead of a wall we should build a army of ass kicking terminators
well he was right about one thingits only gonna get worseunless we do something and make it better
im pro wall and im a us citizen of mexican decent i get hate for that but hey im the type of person that would like for u to ask permission to enter my property rather then to just sneakwe can all get along if we just do things the proper way 
the mastermind individual sounds like a new 1984 book
damnit i was hoping this would be a good one that guy was an idiot he was arguing with himself the whole time
okay the first woman was confusing not to be rude as a mexican american though that wall is just messy sis we aint got shmoney for that
digital passport walk through scanner mark of the beast stations all over the desert i think that will work as soon as i become governor of new mexico ill call in all the rocket scientists and genius mathematicians to work out the details
wow what a couple of complete idiots this is who votes for democrats
lol that second guy votes in our american elections hahahahaha oh my god god help us
god bless ya crowder i do not have the patience you and your crew have id last 10 seconds before yelling keep fighting the good fight
the sales tax illegals flush into the country dont touch the 100billion illegals cost america next
xray borders irradiate everyone to death that crosses seems legit what could go wrong
this guy is proof that the movie idiocracy is coming true what a complete and utter doofus
let me guess your mind was not changed
dont majority of illegal immigrants cross the border by plane or boat making the wall not that useful also many illegal immigrants come here legally and just have expired visas the immigration court system in america is really bad and imo needs a lot of fixing including just adding more courts since im fairly certain that there arent even 50 immigration courts in the us
fuck ya x ray boarders xddd come on over to america but hey you got cancer lmfao i died
walls work illegal immigration through the san diego checkpoint dropped after a wall was built at that part of the border after that they moved over to arizona and new mexico
illegals bring more than cheap labor they co tribute to higher insurance costs for cars health theft business etc the taxpayer educates foreign aliens in our public schools without as much as a dime from their host countries the steal social security ids s they cause rent to increase they take entry level jobs from citizens students and young people many jobs that americans used to do such as constructionthey undermine wage increase so saying they contribute by buying some groceries at the local store hardly makes up for the difference
his face at the end said it all 
all the people walking by yelling are a bunch of idiots and the argument of if you build a wall they will just find a way to get past it is a stupid argument just like if 100 people had to take a shit and there was a perfectly clean private bathroom right next to them all of them would go take a shit but if it was even just a public restroom some would wait until they get home and if it was a locked public restroom none of them or a very small amount would still take a shit and just like if banks left all the cash on a table behind open doors a lot more people would rob them but since the cash is in a vault often times with security and cameras a lot less people rob the bank yes people would dig under the wall fly over the wall go around the wall etc but the amount of illegals would greatly decrease and yes you would have people capable of getting past the wall selling that as a service but if you stop those people or patch their ways around the wall that will also decrease
im from new mexico and when this dude said that i didnt know if i should bust out laughing or spike my phone into the ground
give illegal immigrants cancer using an xray border
an xray border to check an id  why not use a chip and call it the mark of the beast because thats exactly what he was describing
congratulations on 2mil subs
do trumps not a racist change my mind
im a cheap prick 
clinton and obama in the past prior to trump running for president have stated we should stricter immigration policies the only reason he dems have turned is to help their voter base its not rocket science they play this card every election they dont give a fuck about these people either its a game to get in the house senate or white house
uhm over stay visas is a crime its the honor system these idiots are talking about tearing familys apart uhm if they threw the kids in jail with the parents the useful idiots will be crying
never go full retard
just build the damn wall already time to move on from this no brainer subject democrats have twisted brains
so more build the wall change my mind its so triggeringwhich is great
this dude is mexican he doesnt look spaniard spanish and if im not mistaken new mexico belonged to mexico before the us took it
building a wall is a huge  waste of taxpayer money its useless in preventing illegal immigration its mentally retarded to think that building a wall 2 ft higher or 5 inches thicker will prevent illegal aliens from crossing the boarder you first have to establish the rate at which we have illegal aliens crossing the boarder if it is even an actual issue and if they are crossing the boarder wall by jumping over it what do we live in the dark ages
lmfaooooo wow i didnt realize things were this bad even this mexican lady wants them gone haha must be tens of millions of them
is there a full video
you should have blurred the whole lady instead of just the head you can identify someone you know without seeing the face if she is worried about illegals committing criminal acts they might recognize her if they see this video how unlikely doesnt matter
wowa wall is a bad idea but radiation scanners and electronic tracking systems are reasonablejust wow  what a globohomo
im so confused by the spanish guy
its just gonna cost a lot of money tho innit
the second guy pretty much explains the entire concept of a border down to why they are coming into the country and to know who is here like i hope he watches his recording and realizes that
first guy is genuine but he is silly
i think that a wall is good but not even close to 100 fool proof theyve been coming by air and sea too on noncommercial flights and fishing boats i think the us should try to cover all bases air land and sea
yes clearly a xray boarder and id tag citizens is way more practical and less orwellian than a simple wall
why is it that people with no common sense or ideas that have the common  i dunno but like something like that answer seems to be the ones want to talk the most
steven the stare you gave us at the end was priceless  i was staring right back at you with the same look on my face lets get this guy on the show classic
how is the 2nd guy alive his iq is so low
do these people realize there are limited amount of resourceshealthcare education housing food  etc  so we should say come all everybody shut up and pay no we are full here  put the military on the border shoot a fewwhen they start dropping  they will stop comingif they make it in cut the welfare and resources they wont come 
that dudes definitely off
building the actual wall is stupid immigration enforcement is notchange my mind
as a conservative i think the wall is a waste of tax payer dollars
second guy dont build a physical wall make a virtual electronic wall thats still a wall
the left has nothing to stand on
build the wall deport them allrefugees taken on a casebycase basis
hehe 69 dislikes 
dont matter the number come legally or not at all
help me understand something because im against the physical wall the berlin was extremly fortified i mean this baby had what was basically a moute with landmines machine gun towers antipersonnel devices vehicle barriers and armed patrols and even with all of that thousands of east germans made it over to the west side of that wall our measly wall is just going to be tall im sorry i just dont get it
the second guy wants to play tag em and track em but no way to do that as they can simply walk around the scanner lol am i wrong but did he say he was planning to run for office save us oh crowder
what in the fuck is this guy talking about is he trolling or is he just flabbergastingly foolish
your all focusing on poor people stealing your money and jobs1 have a minimum wage and they wont be chosen over you 2bankers are taking your money and using the media they own to divert the attention
is the 2nd guy on speed or something he is just all over the place lol
the iq of the second guy 
illegal immigrantion is unfair to everyone the drop in wages is really unfair to the unskilled labor force being bilingual is also an advantage in the work force which unskilled blacks and whites dont have it they are an unfair burden on the welfare and emergency services system they increase crime through violence drugs and human trafficking do the shit legally
that was hard to watch
get rid of incentives for illegal immigration public schools free healthcare welfare food stamps etc etc and you wont have to worry about illegal immigration
wall shmall
how do you tax people you can not find and are not accounted for
wow that dude ok with tagging humans wow
this man said an xray scanner wtf is he on he trying to give them radiation poisoning instead of helping them
illegal immigrants put money into the economy untrue most of their money ends up in mexico so no second dude they do not pump money back into the economy
that face at the end lmao
xray gates people  xray gates
i wouldnt mind a wall but i dont want it to come from more taxes there are already enough of them
we already have a system to identify administer a citizenship test bestow citizenship and issue a social security numberits called legal immigration
 that was awesome 
i think spaniard leroy was off his happy pills today
the second guy on some crazy shit lol
oh boy the second guy had me cringing hard
there is a wall already we just want to upgrade it and make it more secure
its funny the second guy tried to act smart but full on window licker
that second guy almost gave me a fuckin brain hemorrhage pretty sure i lost some brain cells listening to him
build it tallbuild it deepbuild it strong
you have the patience of a saint
the second guy sounds like he just crawled out from under a rock after 50 years of no exposure to the outside technological world and watched nothing but scifi flicks with his talk of xrays that scan you when you go across the border and shit like wearing wrist things that connect to a database that can be scanned like all techhy mumbo jumbo crowders face at the end summed it all up incredibly well xd
that 2nd guy was hard to listen to
i just got an ad for change my mind on a change my mind video
that spanish guy is too stupid to understand the basic concept of a nation or borders
this gave me a headache
logic seems to have left the building with these people  all too common these days  so many people spend their time keeping up with celebrities and their bullshit rather educating themselves
the guy in the white shirt is the dumbest motherfucker so far on this series
the white man came to the americas under the banner of genocide and slavery who are they to tell other races where they cant live
i think that dude wants a biometric data base border
second dude is advocating for an id tag that will be seen with xray machines you just advocated for the mark of the beast dude
what a fat stupid slut
dont you believe there is a much more effective way to get rid of illegal immigrants most illegal immigrants come from planes
watch this get taken down 10 minutes from now time stamp 632 pacific funny first 2 people i saw sit down were legal citizens of latino ethnicity both complained about illegal immigration but argue against border security disbelief
no borders except a xray border omg lol
oh man the guy is dreaming  come back to earth my friend
spaceforce bitches
im from santa fe please dont let this guy represent our citystate
the second guy might just be legally retarded
i caaant understaaaand you go back to your country white power
check out relentless heart on google and take the john 717 challenge it will bless you
the usa cant allow citizenship on demand foreigners will flood the country and wont a world without borders cause a one world government
dude was so excited that he was adding an a at the end of almost every word overall nobody gave any good points as to why the wall shouldnt be builtit makes me cringe to know i used to be a liberal im so happy i got red pilled years ago
the second man was well just a bit thick in the head
im surprised he didnt get shot
666 chip em
well if you want to get technical 100 of undocumented immigrants are criminals they illegally entered the country which is a crime therefore they are criminals i dont understand why its so hard for people to figure that out
waste of money they can literally just come in legally and then stay do any even get in by climbing over the fence
yes we need to keep all out and do not build a wall cause itll be used against us
haha the second guy was so naive seemed like a nice guy but wow not very well thought out unrealistic ideas
the spanish guy thinks illegals should be taxed so that money can go back into the economyimmigration debate aside this boy needs to read a basic economics book smh
does that guy know hes a moron
second guy changed my mind i hadnt considered mastermind individuals the possibilities have blown my mind
second guy sounds like a good dude but i dont think he thought his ideas through
globalist cucks
how much weed did the first dude smoke better question what kind of weed i want some hahaha xray border hahahahahahaha
nothing makes me cringe harder than an ignorant person and an intelligent person engaging in political discourse
too short of a change my mind
the dude hes talking to ha a good heartjust hasnt quite thought down the line far enough
the guy wants to plant a gps on them to keep track of them hmmmm
illegal imagrints commit crime at a rate of 100its illegal to sneek ito the country
pretty sure that dudes crazy
could just stop the drug war and spend the money on border security
so we chip them and install invisible fence well worked for my dog wtf
honduras and any other latin american country that have american bases in their soil should remove them change my mind
scientifical did anyone else catch that
wish we had more content
i guess we just need a 2000 mile long xray sounds more expensive than a concrete wall just saying
we are living in a society
dont change my mindchange my mind
come to wsu pullman
so mexican guy is in favor of logans runlol
holy shit leroy how the fuck do you get that stupid that was beyond embarrassing cant wait for that xray border itll prob happen in new mexico after leroy becomes governor and sits down with his intellectual masterminds and discusses the scientifical requirements for such a great idea also remember your government issue lead vest next time you travel to mexico
i dont want a wall i dont know there could be like a sci fi scanner that scans illegal immigrants or sth idk this is just a free thought atm i would need a mastermind individual to determine the scientifical merit for this device you know
drugs
electronic id tags on illegal immigrants  fucking brilliant
oh my gosh the guy in the white shirt is a complete brainless moron
this guy makes me want to bang my head against the wall
what was with that last zoom in was that the i cant handle all these crazies look
congrats on 2m subs steven hope you get many more
the dude wants technology thats 100 years away to solve problems today
these are the people of this generation im getting a horse grabbing my rifle and moving to the treeline
guy number 2 have a written noteme oooh like a visa  which would then be enforced with a fucking wall
omg that second guy was next level special in his thinking im a libertarian who doesnt fully support the wall largely due to the spending and issues with eminent domain but seriously an xray border thatd be a shit ton of money ultimately down the drain while we get overrun with illegal immigrants
what the hell was that first guy blithering on about does he even know actually same with the second guy
apparently new mexico is a sanctuary city i didnt know that i live in the largest city in the world
i dont have a problem with the wall itself i just have a problem with asking the people youre keeping out of the country to pay for it i also think you should build one on the canadian border as well
that is a very interesting individualhes essentially asking for the same as we have nowno boarders or checkpoints but a x ray checkpoint to id people that come in then spy on them in cities like the nsa so already but totally for open boarders
almost 20 years we have been hammered with patriotism by media wont be fooled again but when we want to stop the narcoterrorists from south america we are now called racist
where did this dude learn how to talk  they dont talk like that in spain  hes an idiot  build the wall  you cant tax anyone who has nothing and everyone is taxed enough  fools think that taxes fix everything build the wall  once the border is secure the american citizen has all the power to decide what and who can enter  it is not negotiable  midterm elections should put an end to this once and for all  please vote out any dems and rinos that dont support building the wall
steven c  an xray borderspaniard leroy  yea with a straight face
go to a gas station at 530 in the morning it will look like your in mexicomost of them in construction tradesthats were middle class jobs are goingplus if you dont have to pay taxes all construction jobs get undercut because most illegals work for shit wages and make it impossible for legal american s to compete witch drives down everyone s wages and bring home pay and our healthcare and taxes go upi call bullshit send them back sorry i try to love all humans but mexico needs to fight for there own country
rip x
building a wall would only take our resources and is way too much of a cost for the outcome
the borderscountry will disappearbut 510 yearsyou prolly meant to say in the next 5001000 yearsor sooner if some aliens invade us 
why borders why doors lets have a free for all  lets go back to hunter gatherer
i enjoyed the womans conversation yet the video had to much rambling and not enough discussion i hope the next is better
so cringy
that last dude was talking about the mark of the beast as the scripture calls it
something i see in georgia all the time legal immigrants that dont want illegals coming in almost half of the people at my job of around 20 people are legal immigrants and almost all of them want only legal immigrants like them they see the other hispanics that come through the border and how much they take from the rest of the legal immigrants
some kind of uhhh x ray scanner
im sure glad he aint mexican you know because id be hella ashamed of sharing his heritage you know you know
maybe if we had a good wall we wouldnt see children get separated in the first place
that was the most annoying person ive ever listened to in my whole life i literally want to punch myself in the freakin face for finishing the video
leroy didnt change my mind
the walls only purpose is to invoke emotion in people why would a country in massive national debt pay billions on an antiquated and inefficient border wall i am a conservative economically  to me that means that i care about government spending and do not want my hardearned money go to political pandering by either side of the aisle
holy shit that dude was all over the place
hope he talked about how mexico has a boarder wall next to guatemala and how they treat them mexicans conveniently forget that part and how they treat anyone going through
how many come here in tunnels or maybe come up through one of the coasts i would be for the wall if the wall meant the wall plus more enhanced border security but if its just a big fucking concrete slab in the ground i dont see how it would be all that effective
that second guy might be on to something we could encode a digital badge and give them like gold stars to put on their shirts or something yeah thats a great idea i cant see how that wouldnt work 
xray borders for real why not using terminators with drug scanners and laserguns patroling the border that would solve the drug problem damn i am a f mastermind
after listening to the last guy rant honestly what the hell
some people come over have children in america so they can technically stay here legallyits all about morality now if you are starving you will steal food to survive if you are thirsty you will look for water if you need shelter you will build or seek for one illegal or not these people are trying to live a life if they truly want to live in the us they would go through the process of becoming a citizen but this is made more difficult now they can work for it some are disrespectful and steal jobs from actual citizens those who abuse the rules and laws are the ones who should get kicked out that goes for all illegal immigrants who would not even bother to at least try to become a citizen
i support trump and im conservative but think this will be the new wall of chinaits there to keep us in not keep people out they hid it in plain sitethe wall i agree with not at all
how is it fair for illegal immigrants to get a free pass right into the us and education to pass the test when the legal immigrants have to pay money for an airplane ticket learn english and learn the questions for a test if there should be no borders that means everyone in the world not just central and south america can get a free ride here on boats and planes who cares who has to pay for all that mass immigration its for diversity why not fix mexico and the south american countries so people dont feel the need to mass immigrate to the us
hahahaha that first clip though
hmmmif we open our bordersa billion people would walk in and destroy our economy
that dude is literally talking about some shit from back to the future like tf 
it honestly wouldnt help because most get through over staying visas
if their were no borders then their would be no countries land would just be unmarked blobs lol
steven crowderhi there that was just to get your attention this is long but i believe it will be useful im iranian and in my country around 45 years ago they made a rule forcing women to remove their hijab this rule bothered people a lot and women in the majority would find other ways to cover their hairlike hats this gesture from the king of iran is what started a chain reaction that led to the iranian revolution once the revolution ended the leader who took over forced hijab on the women right now in iran many women are finding ways to protest to this by finding ways to get away with showing their hair and the majority of women now hate the hijabi agree with you that more strict rules must be placed and more monitoring should be done however just like what happened in iran if you build a physical wall it can be seen as a bad gesture that will cause more people trying support people in order to get over the border i believe that a physical wall will only make things worselove your videos from your muslim fan 
the second dude watches too much black mirror lol
mexican with a strange scotish accent
so according to the future gov of new mexico we all need to trackers installed so we can allow illegals into the country and track them
they barely can handle their lives but theyre sure they know whats better for the whole country
you should really have censored that lady more  anyone who knows her can still identify her  and might get violent against her because of the clips you chose to keep in
that second guy was to ill informed for me to even pay attention seriously no one cares about your shirty vlog
build the wall
that one guy the real boss hoggs  i wonder if he was a dukes of hazzard fan curious
ya can we get that second guy put on a list of some kind
when the great wall of china was in use they would have guards with torches stationed all the way down the wall leading to the capital if there was an attack they would light the torches one after another until the fire signal reached the capital we should have something similar that detects a breach or attempted breach and sends an electronic signal to the nearest guard station
did that guy really say tax the illegal immigrants tax people who arent pasting taxes
lol at the look he gives the camera at the end
this is what happens when hippies breed
i find it completely unfair for us to take care of illegal immigrants when we cant even take care of our own americans
so let me get this strait a xray like electric wall with a computer chip that is basically a passport is that the idea
so decriminalize the criminals makes sense
i really want a exotic car if i sneak into the factory and take the one i want simply because its to hard and unfair for me to obtain one legally its still a crime and i wont get to keep the car
say aye for the xray wall 
this is another example of why a litmus test should be instated before people can vote on the issues
cheap prick here do you really think the people watching on youtube are free loading pricks put up a paywall and stay inside kinda like a safe space
the pump does 9 damage change my mind
hay guys we also need more people down here in the south because a bunch of illegal people are going threw mobile
woman talks feelsbadmanguy talks stfu
the zoom in at the very end classic
want to know something funny  i have had a few illegal hispanic friends and they always tell me they do pay taxes  the sad part is they are paying state sales tax when they buy items thinking that is taxes  if they were only smart enough to know that there is a state and federal tax on your income as well  silly illegals   rofl
yeah fucking build it already border security is important
holly shit this guy is a genius we need xray walls not border walls
border jumpers should be shot on sight
not cool steven he is clearly unstable dont bring him back lol
great another episode of feed my ego
holy shit this is the one ive been waiting for  why is it so short though
that one dude leroy should be writing science fiction not giving suggestions on open borders heres one for ya leo how about transporters like in star trek
ill never understand why immigration is a hot button issue  the law is clear  we have rules  enforce them  if you dont like the laws change them  you cant argue against that
stevencrowder finish the border wall as it has been in construction for decades however instead of a massive physical wall i suggest a high tech and high manpower wallthere is a problem that is causing this immigration issue its called corruption and cartels if we really want to end this problem we need to attack it 2 fold we have to reform and enhance our immigration policies and systems and also deal with the cartels and the corruption within mexico
the beast will solve all  think about it
trillions of dollars you say
ok you need to start having conversations with smarter people  these conversations dont accomplish anything  that second guy is missing too many brain cells
what the hell did i just watch lol
that second dude is stupid af no offense intended lmao future governor of new mexico keep on planning xray dreams
im sad to say i am a latin americanmost latinos speak out of there feelings not informed properly of immigration and law makes many look stupid and uneducated  i feel bad for crowder not  able find competent people to have a proper conversation
i love the first woman who is against the wall but wants to deport the illegals in her apartment if the wall existed she prob wouldnt have illegals in her apartment
is this guy in austin i want to see one of his change my minds
seriously why do these people contradict themselves all the time and have no idea what they are talking aboutgoing through xray database how do you do that without a fucking border or control in said one
damn it just build it already
no legal or illegal immigration we dont need any more immigrants weve taken plenty we should have 2030 years of no immigration
im gonna suggest something that will drastically reduce the amount of illegal immigration that doesnt cost any money to the tax payers at all trump calls for a media announcementpublic address of sorts he simply says today we have covertly dwoyed x thousand landmines across the usmexico border in the most commonly trafficked areas mexican criminals enter at your own riskhe drops the mic and walks off without saying anymore he wouldnt even have to do it just the threat and possibility would be enough to deter so fucking many of them it would be glorioustill some fbi agents blow some kids up and frame trump and make it appear hes turned the border into a warzoneidk i think its a great idea immoral kinda who cares about morality the border hoppers rarely do
was that last guy advocating for catch tag and release on human beings i mean how else are we going to have this xray scanner without everyone being tagged with a microchip
bruh did he say x ray border
us citizens are not state citizens think of the us government in dc as the same thing as the european union so all the states collectively together are the united states of america the us is the government that regulates trade between the states similar to the eu regulation of countries of europe eg france uk us citizen is like say new york started giving citizenship to everyone that applied but they dont live in new york they live all over the country as residents while being citizens of new york
why does the dude with the camera have the cord around his neck instead of behind his head
that wall just got ten feet taller believe me
what are drugsuh
shes a retard
i dont have any respect for this guy anymore after the socialism is evil episode
build that motherfuckin wall
why hasnt anyone thought of an x ray border wall until now
you might want to blur out the id badge hanging around her neck
so wait he wants to microchip everyone on earth so governments can track their every move uhmm he really thinks thats a good idea whats his youtube channel
mexicans arent the only ones who go through the border other countries go through mexico too to get into the us
that guy was so dumb he made my mind melt
you should take this video down or censor her more
even after they say it out loud they dont understand remember not to vote for that guy you will wait for space unicorns to come and save you before he does anything i feel really sad for that lady she seemed to be in fear for her life just another reason for the wall
imagine the graffiti on the wall if its made
leroy comes in talking all loud and confidently displaying his utter idiocy im reminded of the patron saint of podcasts mr adam carolla when he said stupid people are loud right off the bat spaniard leroy thought stephen was against building the wall or a lame attempt at a joke whats with the accent he and his family have been in new mexico since the 1550s as he said im a 3rd generation american of mexican descent and my mexican accent is a noshow even my parents dont have an accent now if spaniard leroy is avoiding assimilation into american culture by holding tightly on to his nationalist roots why not take his butt on over to his motherland he misses so much
i will gladly volunteer my spare time to help build the border wall maga
1140 not gay jared playing secret stephen service man
wow
hot topic of the day is taking children away from criminals err i mean illegal aliens err i mean illegal immigrants err i mean undocumented agreements err i mean undocumented citizensthen we have corrupt politicians making fake tears about how suddenly now it is wrong especially keeping families apart that have commuted crimes  why are so many gullible people voting these people into office
ya leroy is totally add hes allover the place no developed insight hes just all over the place kind like my boss  its very difficult to work for a person with out of control attention deficit  disorder i love her but its a challenge everyday
 what is that guy on
this was hard to watch
that first dude is border line retarded
unexpected topic nice
omg steven that look on your face at the end priceless
that guy is freaking crazy
the xray scanner that spans across the entire border hahahahaha
this dudes maga 2080 wanting to build that invisible wall
i got excited but then i saw that it was 13 minutes i had to go in my safe space short change my minds are triggering me
finally some interesting topics for this series
im feeling my brain cells die one by one as i listen to the second guy talk lol
take the money you would have spent on the wall and spend it on making mexico a better place to live  theres a reason why people in france arent building tire rafts to come to america  if nobody wants to leave they wont come here
next time discuss about muslims in us please steven read my comment and make a video about it
facepalmthis guy has designs on being the governor of new mexico good luck to him but hes not exactly speaking with much coherence
you guys are totally sponsored by walther you keep wearing the merchandise i love the appearances of their guns
that guy is delusional  has a terrible annoying accent what a dumbass on top of it
so that kid basically wants everyone chipped and tracked   he really hasnt thought that through
so an xray border
am i taking crazy pills or did the second guy take a roundabout way to describe not only a wall but to put personal trackers on everyone yeah that sounds very freeflowing
the first thing i disagree with crowder
xray border
build the wall already 
the second guy steven talked with thats what a 70 iq individual sounds like in case anyone was wondering what the hell is he blabbering about
the wall is in order to filter and document immigrants if you come into america undocumented you can get away with crimes and tax evasion because you are essentially nonexistent why dont people understand that concept
would it be cruel to right immigrants will be probed on the side of the wall they see
your look at the end was priceless lol
make them put into the systemyeah you got a college degreecome on in
without a border enforcement any type of hightech xray system wouldnt work because what if someone just decided to run to the front of the line i give him points for participating
13 minutes ive taken longer shits than this video
scientifical  this guy is beyond retarded he doesnt even understand his own position theres the future gov of new mexico everyonemisinformation is the reason why everyone is an activist today
lady probably thought it was a waste of money building the wall so making it harder to get in could be a better alternative also make them citizens my parent took 30 years to become legal citizens doing it the right way by getting working visa and paying taxes the system to make money of them is already there
oh boy
first of all props to the mexican american for asking the proper steps on getting illegalillegal criminal migrants deportedsecond to the dude holy shit brain cells lost on that one yeah great idea champ xrayid check them get them paths to citizenship but in the same token get rid of borders oxymoron much make up your fucking mind such smart
lets get an army of t800s to moniter who comes in with satellite rays to tag their laser ids so we know when they come in and can tax them your move mexico
ted cruz is a pussy change my mind
god irl streamers are so retarded talk a lot talk fast spout nothing but bullshit
the only reason i dont support a wall is because i am afraid it would mess with the wildlife around the area
itss just an upgraded version of what already exists people just get so triggered and want to call it racism so many are uninformed
the 2nd guy is living in the future
us just tax them make them legal and then they can vote the same traitors in so america can look like the places they left they just cant see the cause n effect of there emotional free thoughts
whew lad this is gonna be a good one
holy fuck didnt know that you interviewed the wrtier of black mirror season 5
who remembers when crowder lost a debate to yusuf
xray id scanner wall 
like if you bursted out in laughter at the look crowder gave the camera at the end
brah  my brain hurts
im not mexican sure you arent poncho
free flowing scientifical rays
build the wall
id passcod but no wall sounds like a great future governor
lets just put a tracker on everyone so the gov can track everyone
wow the second guy is absolutely stupid just like most of them are
this wasnt long enough
bare knuckle canuck leaving a comment
deport to the warp
this was painful to listen to
mexico will never help us with illegal immigration and with handling of theyre  southern borders and the drug lords if all of you that dont understand this thats why the wall must go up
i absolutely love this seriesbut for the life of me could not watch this retard regardless of his viewsi couldnt bare to listen to him back to watching sjw throwdowns
drinking game take a shot every time he says uhh
when you get the crtv ad of a change my mind video on a change my mind video
it sounds like the future governor of new mexico wants a toll booth  but you would need a wall to guide people to the toll booths
can you do a part 2 of this while you converse with actual educated people these people cant even complete a proper sentence
i would love to debate this with him but i live in baltimore md i wonder if he would debate this with me in the comments
2 million 
look at the end of video just pricelessa picture that tells a thousand words 
i cant wait until an intelligent guy sits down with you
bless the first lady who was willing to ask questions
i think that dude was specialgood news tho they found the town fool
i heard that trump shot down the wall himself so like i am confused i havent heard either way about the wall so  i was for the wall but i havent heard anything about it since election xd
rip xxxtentacion
open the borders as soon as we end the welfare stateproblems solved
why is it so short 
why bler out her face but not her badge
so apparently crowders transgender change my mind video is an ad on this video lel
the second guy is no mastermind individual how do these morons survive to adulthood
guy 2hes a little excited and a little retarded  and watched 1 too many marvel movies talking about this xray machine at a random location not a border hes a little bipolar is my official opinion
leroy who is selling you drugs
drugs coming over borders is actually a huge problem because the dea is cracking down really hard on this socalled opioid epidemic so people that do have chronic pain and have lifelong conditions cannot get prescribed the medication and the suicide rate is going up and illegal drug use is going up just so they can function day to day its sad but its true and ive seen it and then they get hooked on these drugs and they die or they just stay on them for life and doctors wont take them seriously but they also dont want to uphold the hippocratic oath 2 help a patient and in pain and suffering or control it without discrimination
holy fuck iq test to vote now
the 2nd dude from new mexico is way off base i grew up in new mexico i am part mexican my wife is a legal immigrant and we had to leave because of the crime last year it is so violent there bullets have gone through my wall our cars have been stolen i have witness people murdered it desperately needs help
if someone is doing something illegal its gonna be hard to convince them to do the legal thing you think they are gonna have a get right with jesus moment and all of the sudden do the legal thing of course notthats why we have the problems with illegal immigration today build a wall andor secure the border do what needs to be done i pretty fed up with my tax dollars go to people doing illegal activites in general
ah nope
what the hell was the second guy talking about
jesus he needs to quit hitting the crack pipe before trying to hold a serious conversation just fucking clueless
im sorry but that second guy is an idiot he is just vomiting nonsense in vocal form i one day plan on being the governor of new mexico lol
that second guy is a complete joke as soon as he said he wanted open free flowing open borders i immediately started laughing  he reminds me of the retard lefty teachers and peers who tried to brainwash us when i was growing up
what science fiction is this x ray border
got a crowder ad before the vid
the first 10 seconds i died lmfao
person 1  i dont support a wall but i want to deport my emigrant neighbors because they are criminalsperson 2  i dont want a wall because it wont work  there is a better solution but i have no idea what it issigh
950 sounds like germany in the 40s
i liked the spaniard dude respectful but a little uniformed
an xray machine border httpsyoutubecwihv7a6luy
thats pretty short compared to others change my mind
this dude wants to microchip people and track them lmao
there is a third type of people who watch it on youtube mug club members who are to busy to watch a full hour iammugclub inormallywatchonyt
only 13 mins 
dude in the white shirt and backpack doesnt want a wallhe wants a fucking panopticon
build that fucking wall
you gotta do this somewhere else where youll get some sit down interviews
the 2nd guy wants a world government and the mark of the beast stupid fucks i swear
woah hes talking about quantum physics border xray magic gates w e     h a v e     t h e     m a s t e r m i n d
hey crowderplease if possible cover her id card otherwise she is dead meat when this video picks up and it will there will be people looking for her to do justice ms13 style believe me as a latino who grew up in a really bad neighborbood i can tell you what is done to informants aka leechers
 35 commuting 37 of murdersjesus christ
gfoh with that tag shitwhats to stop the government from tagging legals omg wow and hes serious with his ideology
man what year was the second guy living in xray border scanning
we definitely need that wall and all the improvements and upgrades along the border to protect our sovereignty
unpopular opinion here but are there stats on the number of people that are in the states illegally that got through the border legally and just overstayed their visas i feel like a lot of illegal immigration is just due to the prohibitively strict laws that might prevent people from reentering the united states after theyve left which results in people over staying i dont have numbers because its not a topic i care about passionately enough to look into but i feel like there should be more to this than just huurrrr durr build dat wall kick out dem durn immigrunts
so he doesnt want a wall but a digital id tagscanner system that would cost tons more than a wall wow
we need an xray border
i have a problem with the people who advocate for no borders no walls a lot of us came to this country to literally get away from a shithole country last thing i want is for them to open the all borders and turn this into the shithole ieft behind
issue green cards and keep the good and weed out the bad
i know a couple of really nice mexicans so we should let all of them in and stop having a border you bigot have you considered the feelings of these hypothetical illegals you should just tax these people that arent even in the system
governor    omg 
yikes paraphrasing i dont want a wall i want an xray scifi walli cant believe these people exist i wonder what type of idiots our forefathers were dealing with when they decided to frame a republic instead of a democracy  the fact that they were dealing with higher levels of illiteracy back then versus now makes me understand their decision
i love uneducated people talking about pharmacology its a good way to show me that you are stupid anyway
this guy is has the iq level of a pea
walls are dumb ladders are cheaper before you say but muh israel israelis are willing to use lethal force to stop illegal aliens that is what works not their wall their wall only shows where the line is
taxes  our taxes dont pay  for anything trump just gave military like 1 trillion dollars so far
build the wall with your ass so original
illegal immigration is a blot you are not entitled to enter any country you wish just like you are not entitled to enter someones house without their permission go through the legal process i support making this process more efficient but america should have high standards on who gets to come into the country otherwise we get people that will abuse the country and the generosity we offer
steven should have just drawn a picture for the guy
uh
i thought there was already a wallfence thing
holy crap he cant complete a thought
if i come here illegally i want free healthcare dental housing food stamps and daycare otherwise im not coming
just make them legal perfect reward them for their crimes
1054  hey folks meet the next governor of new mexico
the second guy seemed unstable that was probably more dangerous than going to detroit
first
i dont think id find comfort with that not gay guy having my back there
that look at the end though
she has a plant in a bottle
why sooo short
so basically that guy is suggesting chipping all the illegal immigrants
this was to short release a part 2 asap
the last guy was such a fucking hippie jesus christ
i believe there should be no border patrol but i also think we need some kind of border patrol
damnit man    
crowder if you see this hit me up  ill show you a corrupted small town that hides and protect illegals they commit crimes and wont be arrested  ive seen it with my own eyes   ill take you to the mayor and everything im ready to fight back cause its getting crazy out here

annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnddddd the cartels just killed her whole bloodline
just another thing you can do while wearing ranger panties
xray border op
i gotta go make some popcorn for this love you steven
that dude was a fucking idiot lol
the lady was really nice
finally
can you deport leroy for being a total buffoon
was waiting for this one
what the hell just happened leroy lmao
both people were very civil great episode
we should focus on wages theres no question that mass immigration has played a major role in the wage stagnation that the average american has seen over the past 50 yearsdemand for labor increases wages when demand for workers is high wages are high its impossible for demand for workers to be high in most fields there are some outliers like healthcare when we have added tens of millions of immigrants to the workforce its impossiblemass immigration kills wages mass immigration does not help the average american the average american has seen their wages stagnate for more than 50 years now and mass immigration plays a huge role in that
not gay jared a indians fan go tribe
xrays or any raysdont work like that
do another
that dude in the white shirt must have ate alot of paint chips as a child im amazed natural selection let him make it this far in life my god hes delusional lmfao
its not about taxes and get more money you fcking mexican vlogger uncontrolled immigration brings lots of problems issues with the economy and shape cultures in ways your country dont want a multicultural country will never exists cuz they will create a new culture for that place hard different point of views creates divisions and it never enriches
i think we shouldnt build the wall mainly because of how expensive and ineffectivepeople that are illegal are not all criminals mexico is having political problems and there crime has goten worse which is why people are coming from mexico to escape bad conditions and to give a better life for there children i understand that this is not every one is like this but making a wall will make us pay a lot of money and will not stop people from getting in  sorry if i have errors i am bad at grammer and punctuation
im glad he was respectful towards him 
the second guy wants auschwitz tattoos for people coming in
i believe that we should deport them simply on the principle that they broke a law therefore they should be punished we dont grant amnesty to thieves murderers and other criminals so why should we treat illeagal immigrants any differently
holy crap an xray border would cost more than a plain wall lmaooooo
oh damn its like that legal immigrants are threatened by illegals
did i not get the memo on how the world became dumb over night this was hard to watch
i dont think there should be a wall that would be too intrusive we should just make everything in minority report real
build a hilarious obstacle course at the border and sell it on pay per view anyone who gets thru it wins a free catapult ride back home
fuck off were full especially for people that have no skills dont speak our language and as a majority take more in welfare than they contribute in taxes also research the change in crime rate before 1965 to after when we first changed our immigration policy to allow 3rd world immigrants
the amount of tyranny i fear would be implemented to tag everyone electronically but i hear what hes saying  i still want a wall  mind not changed but i heard him out 
2nd dude gave me a headache immigration is such a huge issue if the politician in their countries cared they would make sure to take care of its citizens but they are heavily selfish colombia has a huge immigration problem with venezuela right now so much that the economy cant sustain them all
not sure how you keep a straight face listening to such absolute bullsht
bet cant wait to watch
funnel everyone to an xray gate without using walls or bordersa turnstile in the middle of the desert with a open sign lit above it  ok thatll work
build the wall  deport all illegals without mercy  strip detain and deport all new attempts  come here legally or not at all
the guy with the go pro is insane lollets trade our daily freedom so we can go without a wall1984 much you narcissistic cam whore lol
that first mexican lady a fuckin bitch reporting illegal immigrants she should know how hard it is for mexicans commin and trying to better their life thats fucked up ehh im not a illegal immigrant but my granddad is and ik how hard it was for him to get through but now we are very rich so hard work pays off
more change my mind
hard to watch leroy is a fucking idiot most people seem to be these people are so stupid they cant even recognize how stupid and uninformed they are just think about the fact they their vote negates yours fuck democracy  look at these people and think of the term jury of your peers scary isnt it
john kenn mortensen
honestly illegal immigrants genuinely piss me off because my mom went through so much to get her green card they make it out like its nearly impossible to get one when its not just do your part and youll be fine its so much easier illegal immigrants live in fear because of the wrong decision they made they get everything for free and dont even pay taxes why should we feel any sympathy for them when theyre living off of us
843 this idiot without borders there is no country
we need an xray border to tag people coming inive never facepalmed so hard
that dude went full scifi at the end there
the real problem with immigration is that the cartels basically own the latin american countries and their leadership through secret dealings with establishment figures of western world etc the south american people associate these dealings to the common people of usa and europe do not let this become a distraction they want us divided the liberals are dividing the migrants to fear the common man in usa thus increasing local antagonism be aware
xray border
what kind of sci fi drugs was the second person on
everyone in this comment section came from immigrants change my mind
its time we start sending these open borders people to non western countries as a reality check they are lost in the propaganda
red flag the second interviewee basically described the mark of the beast from the bible as a solution very scary if this came to be to where the govt can track your movements with precision accuracy whats to stop them from putting these socalled scanning devices everywhere thought police would be arresting you for posting what is considered hatespeech i get it everyone wants security but to say that youre willing to give up somebody elses rights to attain this specific right for yourself is completely asinine
build the wall realy the us is breaking theres no moneylol
my heart goes out to the first person who sat down then i proceeded to sigh in disappointment after listening to the second speaker who was without any thought or critical thinking conflating immigration with illegal immigration then again without missing a beat using words like magic spells to get results talking about having a tagging and checkin system at the border even though he claimed to disagree with the wall and borders mad respect to steven crowder for having the patience to deal with this and the tact to leave on good terms with the people he speaks with during the panels
your expression at the end says it all xd
interesting how people are saying deport them all in the comments i guess all doesnt include their children
build that wall
2nd guy had some good points i dont agree but he had some good points
why the fuck is the video  so short
out of what percentage of illegal immigrants commit crimes uhhh 100 illegal is in their title
my parents left a former soviet country became citizens legally have never broken the law pay their taxes love the country and worked hard after earning their phds oh and learned english within the first year meanwhile its fair for illegals to get a free pass
im mexican american conservative but i dont agree with the wall i just think its a primitive idea that wont work maybe it did back then around the time of jesus but nowadays it can be easily beat by some ladder and some rope tunnels exist too i do want more border security but i just dont feel a wall will succeed
only 13 minutes long what a shame
sekiro ghosts of tsushima         change my mind
this guy youre interviewing is evidence that your country is doomed
2nd guest just shove the government fist right up my ass
the spanish guy is retarded as hell sorry to insult but he is for border security and the wall but not for it 
her face got blurred but she has a visible id tag on with her face
dude is definitely on coke
these people have no respect for borders or the law but lol they will just pay taxes facepalm
i like these videos but i like them more if it was on a college campus im 37 a lot of people my age are on the left i know they are wrong but i like to see what the sjw babys are thinking
you should of asked him how many people does he think is fare to let in a year
not gay jared is the most intimidating body guard with those sun glasses and that hand on his hip  watch out
530 hes spanish  you said your family has been here since the 1550s stop the lies your a mexican too
my family has been in new mexico since 1550 the americas werent colonized until 1607
too short want to see a longer one
im the biggest pogo fan now
why dont you make any economic arguments stevencrowder its so simple to defeat these people by doing so you could reference the housing market and how having a massive  sudden influx of people causes a huge spike in housing prices  increases homelessness this is one of the reasons housing in california is so dang expensive the demand for housing literally cant keep up with the supply of housing by simply referring supply  demand you could wreck these people steven
i gotta say these people were pretty interesting lol they were cordial and decent though so i give them props for that
liberals keep repeating the separate children from parents narrative when they dont bat an eye when it comes to abortion 
this man doesnt even know hes hispanic not spanish
that fuck tard just might win if he runs
next you should do im not feminist change my mind or something like that
im pretty sure that second guy was trollingi honestly hope he isnt that fucking stupidan xray boarder  like what the actual fuck xd
youre extremely intelligentbut you talk too fast and you are a bit over the top
im disappointed with this change my mind no strong arguments opposing the wall
construyan la pared  build the wall in spanish in case there are illegals watching this video
mexican dude is on amphetamines
2 change my minds in 1 week yesss
this talk about removing borders annoys the shit out of me so you fucks dont want borders okay then lets have the us annex mexico if they cant help their own people to the point that they feel the need to enter our country with their problems then lets deal with it at the root
build a wall well maybe you should show them that theres already a wall there in most places not only one wall theres in fact as much as 7 structuresobstructions in some cases including a big ass wall maybe you should show them the clip of obama saying it would be stupid to build a wall while government workers were out building an actual wall on his orders  and building an existing wall even higherliterally out building a wall while hes saying it would be stupid to build a wall no jokemaybe you should show them the footage of illegal immigrants bragging about their invasion and how theyre now in majority in several californian cities and at this rate american will be in minority to illegal immigrantschildren of illegal immigrants and no there not called dreamers no way no how
70 of pakistanis are inbred 67 of saudi arabians are inbred 64 of those living in jordan and kuwait are inbred 63 of sudanese are inbred 60 of iraqis are inbred 54 of muslims in the united arab emirates and qatar are inbred 2530 of those in turkey are inbred keep em out
i just think building a wall would create a lot of division that has never proven successful in the past
i love a good change my mind  
push them to the front of the line so they can be legal fuck that my grandparents came from italy  the legal way and couldnt speak english so they gave them the last name bell i guess thats the price of freedom huh
god i cant wait to sign my name on that big beautiful wall
travel anywhere super fast super cheap someone has seen too much star trek
xray scanner lol
the second speaker you had was awesome  i loved his open mind and ideas and general just niceness about him 
wanting to keep illegal immigrants outnot wanting to build a wall pick one
that guy was hyper unintelligent stevens face at the end summed up my feeling to a t
build the motherfucking wall
call tony stark  he will figure all this out  hes a genius you know
this may have had the least information and debating ive ever seen a change my mind was it really that bad
conservatives are such pussies i swear they dont have the balls to say that immigrants from mexico and central america are a net loss they just dance around it and try to make it sound as if illegal immigration is the sole problem rather than third world immigration in general
we demand more yusef
there should be a sign up sheet for people to volunteer to come build the wall  i bet so many people would volunteer to work that the entire job could be done for very low labor costs
okay that dude has been taking so many drugs hes stuck in a forever cycle of dumb xray scanners no wall written statements and wanting to be governor i hope he knows to be governor you have to actually be able to comprehend and piece words together in an articulate way i think i lost some brain cells listening to him speak
that spanish guy couldnt finish a thoughthis mouth couldnt keep up with his brain
god people are so ignorant people dont understand that there is a difference between illegal immigration and coming into this country legally theres nothing about wanting a to protect our country from illegals that is racist im mexican and completely against illegal immigration
build the xray border
why did i get a cnn adand also fuck your wall isnt exactly a good argument lol
i didnt catch who the last guy said he was and who he was with anyone who did want to let me know  if he posts a video of the discussion on his own channel it could be fun to watch 
simpler and more freeflowing but with a lot more cost and technology and complexity  you know a border but without the border or logic
i see it comingaaaaaano wallaaaaa no bordersaaaaaaaa
great video
some kind of xray border that shows us where they are at in the city  whaaattttttt hahahahahahahaha
the ending was awkward
this was a bad video no content no sjw pleading save the children no bleeding leftists crying your separating the families without know any facts this was a fail but also a positive that may end up being a negative in the up coming elections cause the dems are gonna hammer the border cause they will not pass the bill to reform and use it as a taking point
you should have done this at the keep families together march haha you would have gotten plenty of people
the  guy the in with the white shirt is a nut  hes trying to sound proper and its hilarious
congrats on 2 mil
hey idiot never mind the taxes but who is giving them a free house a job without considering the american people and food
anyone else having a hard time following what this dude is trying to say complete a thought and complete a sentence ffs
the 2nd guy studied linguistics at the james hettfield school of communications  theyre going to walk in hereah some kind of codeah or databaseah
mr trejo doesnt need to talk he needs to listen he didnt formulate one coherent sentence
if they come through the xray border gate wearing tin foil hats wont that block the mind scanners jeez steve where did you find these people
wowjust wowthat dude wants to be governor wow
im sorry that i made fun of your nose that one time
gotta love steves foreshadowy stare at the end
trump shouldnt be seperating parents from their kidsthey all need to be sent back to wherever they came from
we have such a high technology and yet were relying on a wall use drones or get better technology to watch and patrol the border we can have a better security and help americans by creating jobs for the border instead of a wall
that look at the endpriceless
rfid border
can you do a donald trump isnt racist chang my mind
most of the time they dont sneak over the border though yes it does happen but usually they legally fly over to visit family and then just never leave and lets be completely honest there are a lot more things that are hire up on the list then hunting down illegal immigrants
have he ever actually change his mind
the spanish guy has some points but most of he is mostly incoherent ranting and crazy statements he is in his own bubble
1056 is scientifical a word
that dude is pie in the sky
so for the legals who dont want the wall dont want it why they miss out on reporting themselves to ice and getting free transportation illegals dont pay tax or contribute or assimilate frankly what is this moron blogger talking about if you want nothing to do with me i want nothing to do with you  build that wall
the all powerful xray border
my grandfather immigrated to america from greece legally to escape nazi tyranny if there were a lot illegals like nowadays i wouldnt be where i am
wether i agree with the second guy or not at least he was real thought process and they were able to speak and try
do this one again this guy was a joke as usual great job
borders are going to be a thing of the past  yeah fuck that no thanks
at first i thought this second guy was out to lunch but the more i heard it sounded like prime mark of the beast technology
that woman aint legal lol
1315 mfw xray borders
in theory if there was a radiation field near the boarder you could know who crossed based on residual radiation
well done
the guy who was spanish  ha  ive known a few people like that its a subculture in mexico  they are immensely proud of their pure spanish bloodline unpolluted by that greasy dark indian blood  but when it suited him you can be sure this guy would start with the you be racist  you be racist
man how high is the guy in the white shirt he cant even form a proper sentence i dont know how crowder kept from busting out laughing
i dont want to live in east berlin
as a proud american of hispanic background i say build that fucking wall
blurry face blurry thoughtswtf
no border wall but thats bad but rfid tagging and tracking them live thats ok holy shit thats fucking scary why didnt he just go full running man and install explosives on the chip that can be detonated for infractions of thought crime
building a wall is so idiotic spend that money on further enhancing your border security infrastructure youd probably stop more illegal immigration that way but hey what do i know im a canadian cuck
obama was a bad president change my mind
hmm for some reason this video is giving me some fits  very slow buffering but of course i looked up a pride month video and clicked on that super fast buffering  youtube throttling again
did sven computer steal the church van
lmfao that end stare doe
ive said it for years legal immigrants hate illegal immigrants
this is pretty idiotic on your part crowder a title like immigration reform change my mind would have worked much better you should be smart enough to know how most people would react to phrase build the wall now we just missed out on some possibly good discussion
the guy is completely nuts and out of touch lol
i have a feeling that guy is a star trek fan lol also i bet he is against the idea of chipping people to yet his idea would mean chipping every single mexican jus to know whenever one decides to jump over his xray border 
i got a louder with crowder ad of only 2 genders on this change my mind is this a crossover episode lmao
yaaaassss ive been waiting for this one i have a friend that refuses to accept the wall and i will never understand them
so both of those interviews where all over the place  i feel people dont think the border security through its just the illegal immigrants are the victims or on the other side its they are all evil if we dont have or secure borders we cease to be a nation and turn into an anarchy state we have laws to protect people thus laws must be enforced and when laws are outdated or wrong we need to change said laws and we have 3 branches of government in order to be able to do that but ignoring laws is not the answer
turn off the lights lock the door and look in the mirror say build the wall 3 times and legend says a wild trump will appear
second person wow that is one thick head yeah xrays to tag their id what so theyd have to aome how already have these id tags like what the fuck he wants to microchip everyone guy is special kind of stupid
never   stop   making   these
yo blur her credentials
make their country better stop making ours worse
i find is extremely funny that children being detained is all the rage right now you know what wouldnt break families apart but would stop them from entering the country illegally a wall
not even a minute in but ima make a video called steven needs longer shorts change my mind
hillary clinton belongs in prison change my mind
this is getting dangerous really fast  god forbid anything bad happening to steve crowder or his crew  being out in the streets stick to the college campus man  theres nothing out in the streets for you  kids are our future make them think
theres a war down there wait shit i said too much lmfao
hell yeah build a wall america deserves a secure and protected border
the second person is so drugged out lol
ask these people if you dont believe in walls then why do you lock the doors of your home
even change my mind segments start with pogo i dig it
that second guyno mastermind individual would support open borders of any kind this guy is too stupid to have his opinion taken seriously supporting illegal immigrants in any capacity is just helping strengthen the cartel so when you hear someone say they dont want illegals deportedjust assume they support the cartels corrupt strangehold on mexican politicians police and military members
i got an ad that showed ur last change my mind
this guy in the white shirt isnt making any sense
that guy gave me a headache
i think shes saying lending and not laundering she just mixed up her words shes clairfying what loan sharks are and accidently uses laund before correcting herself and saying lending a couple times making this money laundering and not lending is slightly more heinous and naturally supports your argumentbut i think its erring on the wrong side of caution this time great video otherwise
i like how he had pogo playing in the background ever so slightly respect brother
is this guy high really stupid or both
guess what steven i got a notification 
xray boarder sure why not
mmk so the founding fathers were overwhelmingly against immigration at all americanism was an ideal and if you bring people in it will kill the culture of those ideals benjamin franklin specifically talked about that when he said it wasnt needed because the country would fill up naturally honestly we need to stop all immigration until we can integrate into a nation of those ideals again
this guys in white is retarded
ill be honest this one felt like a bit of a waste there wasnt a single actual argumentthe dude was clearly against illegal immigration but was literally too crazy to have any idea what he was talking about
im not personally for a border wall and feel that it cost to much money and the government needs to spend less although i am for strict border security and lowering the amount of migrants allowed to enter the country legally from 1m to 500k i would rather lets say ramp up security by increasing troops at the border with extra fencing that stretches across the entire border the amount of money that wall production and maintenance would cost would be to much and the government already spends to much
mr metekor is the best pony change my mind
that ending
mastermind individuals k got it
when you get a change my mind ad on a change my mind video
an xray border lmao thats great
if you dont come here legally then you dont have the same rights as an american citizen i dont care what the reason we dont want you here we dont need you here so dont piss us off bye being a sneaky little cunt we will allow you to come if you show us that you want to be here and are willing  to work hard
there doesnt need to be liberal in liberal arts change my mind
lets take the illegal immigrants and put them in work camps so they build the wall when they are done send them home and thats how we make these people pay for it
holy crap  that dude leroy has runon of the mouth disease  jeeze doesnt have a freakin clue about anything
the guy who had the go pro filming is a complete idiot he doesnt understand anything about the immigration he wants no borders are you retarded
that guy in the white tee made me cringe every 20 seconds
you got me im a cheap prick but the more i watch the more i strive for the mug
what the hell kind of accent makes this dude pronounce fast as fasteh
this was the worst chance my mind videos because of the participates but good topic keep it up
having a wall wouldnt help you can get ladders and other shit to get over
the spaniard dude is retarded 
who needs a wall a big ass xray
feminism is cancerchange my mind
i have a question what makes someone spanish i thought if you are born in spain that is what makes you spanish correct because i speak english and i dont say im englishi wasnt born in england lol
damn he ran in there hot just to look dumb af
there should be a strongly guarded border wall with 35 immigration checkpoints alongside it any immigrant that wants to adapt to american culture work hard and be proud of the united states should be allowed into a sanctuary city different from the polarizing ones already in existence these cities would house immigrants and monitor their work ethic with an entirely immigrant population they will not be taking american jobs anyone who does not work serve or study will be detained and deported along with criminals after 25 years of living in the sanctuary city the nowamericans will be allowed to leave and make their lives in the rest of the country leaving room for new immigrants with this method immigrants will assimilate and prove their worth while also creating jobs at the immigration checkpoints along the border there may be a few problems with this plan but if made popular congress should be able to fix them
lol the 2nd guy is on drugs
make america white again
macedonia is part of greece not a seperate slavic nation change my mind
thats cool that the guy gave you such great content because hes such a buffoon but what the f does he think this is blade runner 2049
too short
build that wall
why do all these people seem uneducated
buildthewall
my problem isnt with the illegal immigrant question i question its effectiveness when 40 of illegal immigrants come on planes and most of them come legally but overstay their welcome the wall would be mildly ineffective at best plus the billions of dollars it would require to plan build and maintain the wall each year just to keep out a few thousand immigrants would harm the economy more than it would help
build the xray wall
how ignorant can you be
steven i love that you did this segment id hope you be willing to do it again in the future and get some more inputs from more people
this guy thinks hes gonna be governor lmaoooooo
illegals to migrate to wakanda and sheet wall
where was all the outrage when barry from honolulu was pres  same law same procedures

seriously only 1617 minutes
build the wall
immigration isnt necessary change my mind
wheres fornite when you need it
i just got an ad for the only two genders change my mind while i was watching this
im against illegal immigrants but im against the wall because we dont have the funds for it and theres no chance in hell that mexico will pay for it
i dont think a wall is the perfect answer but i do agree with illegal aliens entering the country is the anti immigration
the guy who claimed to be spanish from mexico seems like he doesnt think things through thoroughly
seems like youtube is messing with internet speeds
as you humans become a spacefaring species borders will be absolutely crucial to prevent the spread of infectious diseases to yourself and your native wildlife trust me as an alien myself weve been there buildthewall
xray scanner lol a border would be a lot cheaper
need to do this topic again this guy was horrible not knowledgeable was looking forward to you debating someone with a better argument
lol why did i get a there are 2 genders change my mind as an ad before this
a super chocolatey fudge coated mega scanner
the absolute madman
i got a change my mind crtv ad on this video

build it tall
this guy was confusing me lol
god damn he was patient with leroy that face at the end explained everything
im first i cant fucking believe it finally after all this times
i was just talking about this with a friend on this issue and she said all the studies have shown the wall wont have any effect on illegal immigration anyone know what she was talking about i just cant imagine a border wall would have no effect
9547563711 text me your hate or call me 
whats the current price for the xray tagging system preposed
we need the wall as a deterent we need order and control of who comes into our country  its more than people coming through
 to that 2nd guest as well wow just wow god help new mexico if he becomes the governor 
i looked that last guyss page up and its just about smoking weed
bind your wall to left click and use metal
that dude in the white shirt seems to have some issues
xray boarder
the one dislike is an immigrant
lol the second guy had no idea what he was talking about
why at 514 did i hear the jaws theme start to play
it has to be built period
1317    priceless
lets xray those immigrants
can we just get rid of illegals now
if people are already risking their lives in order to come to america im sure a wall wont change their decision its just one screwed up situation neither the left or the right have a proper solution
thank you for keeping up with change my mind series great show
dude these people can barely even speak let alone debate why dont you debate someone with some intelligence in this subject haha
that ending stare down
the spanish guy makes me want them to add 20 more feet to the wall
the last guy was literally a nazi
why isnt this an hour long
i dont use the word dumb to describe people often but this guy is a fucking retard
the future governor of new mexico
islam isnt a religion of peace change my mind
that governor of new mexico thats been thinking about this stuff for years is pretty clueless
i live in new mexico and i can tell you right now this guy will never be elected governor theres nothing separating him from the rest of the illinformed people here
while working for the tax government agency  i found many mexicans didnt pay taxes because their income is lowhowever they claimed the maximum of children for earned income credit child tax credit and additional tax creditmany times they made more in a refund in tax refund then they claimed they made in a year  also some dont have a social security number  they use an itin identification number so they can claim the child tax creditsmany times they claim children that are not even theirs  the irs has cracked down more on not allowing credits without verification they live in the household such as letter from school
can i get free mug
that face at the end says it all haha
i can appreciate you blocking her face  am honest opinion without allowing anyone to crucify her  
trump is so stupid why didnt he think of using an xray to cover the entire us border
shit dude that mexican dude wants to be chipped and read without borders we have no country its simple and easy to understand
i hav to to go be told wat think about this   x ray micro wave laser pointer thing

this is gonna be good
the hispanic dude seemed like a nice guybut he has the iq of a fleshlight
im a born american citizen who got stuck living in south america for 18 years reason i had to be there for 18 years is because my father wasnt there to allow me to get a passport and i had to become an adult and prove to the american embassy that as an adult i could get an american passport to come back to the states some weird ass law that prevented me from getting passports as a kid without my father there forced me to live in a fucking third world country for 18 years this is why im against illegal immigration because as an american citizen i had to immigrate back to my own fucking country legally if i did it they can and should fucking do it as well
oh shit lol you crazy bastard crowder
build the wall high and electrified
can we all just admit the truth most leftists are stupid and ignorant because they never exercise free thought or critical thinking
idk where he went he deleted his comment but some fuck was calling out the first woman with racist insults and slurs and labelling here an illegal wherever youve gone sir a shes a legal immigrant and bthis has nothing to do with race
xray boarder please

god bless this sweet scared lady  reality check folks
yeah man dont do what your doing now just like do the same thing but ill mastermind that shit once i get moar high bro
sorry but the future governor is an idiot
a drunk illegal totalled my parked car and the cop let him walk  away when i seen the judge she said dont worry about it your insurance will pay for it  two weeks later i received the money the illegal didnt have to come to court or anything true story
arrest libs force them to labor building the wall on completion  toss them over
the wall isnt practical though and will keep more immigrants in dont get me wrong i am all for fighting illegal immigration but building a wall isnt going to solve the problem
the wite man brings in the drugs
why do those liberals want to make sweet sweet love to a wall
the 16th century spanish american bspardon my french didnt know his horse from his elbow
i dont want to get off on the topic crowder
even if you are against illegal immigration there is absolutely no evidence building a wall will deter their numbers lol idiots
lol i got a crtv ad showing the 2 genders change my mind
that guy is on drugs
1000 this guy is probably a customer of the drug trade
yea i get we already have crime normally but why allow more crime to come in isnt the goal to reduce crime hence prevent more illegals from coming in
tracking devices on every illegal thats going to work out
homeboy plans on being the governor of new mexico fuck me thats hilarious
my god leroy is insane he proposed everything that would cause global tryanny
that lady is wanting to get her head chopped off 
build the space wall
the man who sat down to change stevens mind forgot his foil hat
anyone know where crowder got his statistics
public beheading for illegals
god those poor people are so being fed nothing but shit  it infuriates me this level of ignorance an the unwillingness to inform themselves but purposely act as if they are informed
a gate with no wall    thatll work
that was not a great blur job hopefully she will be ok in the future
build the xray gate
roses are red violets are bluebuild the wall deport them all
so how many generations before your family becomes mexican  this dude doesnt know he is mexican how does he know whats best for america             this dude thinks we should put a force field on board there is a huge hole in his theory if they avoid the check points what will stop them from avoiding the micro chip
the second guy thinks he could be the governor of new mexico
1344 total time yikes no one wanted to debate huh
i am an immigrant the wall needs to happen
a lot of the hard working mexicans dont put into the system they dont at all work hard enough to get what they end up with legally they get paid under the table
lol xray wall
the wall just got 10 feet taller and now it will shoot xrays at immigrants
i found that guy annoyingam i the only one or what
please do a part 2 need a longer version of this
as the son of a legal immigrant i say build that wall if my poor mother can come here legally with the little money she had at the time so can everyone else
tax em lol
he is just saying what sounds smart to him
2nd guy is a total nut job
you gotta come here legally my dad waited 10 years to do it despite living in the worst conditions in a communist country if he can do it so can anyone else keep it legal and fair for everyone to have a chance to get here
digital scanner might as well just say you wanna stamp us with the mark of the beast
if my country was a pile of garbage like mexico i would try like hell to not be deported back but i dont understand the illegals who stay here for years not even trying to become a citizen just become a citizen and you 0 chance of being deported simple
people going crazy over the wall lol its not like building the wall is going to completely keep immigrants out they just have to come in legally stricter enforcement is needed if you are a legal immigrant you have nothing to worry about if you really want to come to this country then do it legally
whats up love your content
ill have two number 9s a number 9large a number 6 with extra dip a number 7 two number 45s one with cheese and alargesoda
lets show some d e p o r t t
even if it stopped only 10 the saved costs pay for it fairly fast
this guy is a real dum fuck
this isnt long enough make a part 2
dont most illegal immigrants come over by plane and then overstay their visa i dont see how a wall would stop that
remember when you called me a conspiracy theorist for saying that the government was going to use old shut down walmarts as detention areasguess what
wish these were longer love them
give more americans jobs by building a new wall on the northern border
what the hell is the second person talking about hahahaha
423 you set yourself up
haha the mental gymnastics of the second guy 
austin  well theres your problem
this is one of my favorite series love what crowder does but they maybe shouldve left the first lady out entirely or just done audio with voice distortion
an xray border 
i just got a change my mind ad on a change my mind video
crazy to me how 2 years ago i wouldve been one of those idiots yelling things like fuck trump or fuck the wall 
this was a total clusterfuck lol
build that wall
why the fuk is he not wearing pants
the chicano accent burns my ears
rip x
that guy is fucking weird lmao
snoop dogg was there
what a bunch of idiots
nice job blurring her face too bad you left the badge completely unblurred smh
how do you do it my head hurts watching these videos
only 10 minutes late new record
maga
i got an ad for crtv that was a minute of footage from your there are two gender vid
x aint dead
do white privilege is a myth
the only tax illegals pay is sales tax
this nigga is high
i think we definitely need to crack down on illegal immigration but building a wall just seems silly
this second guys is such a brainlet
every person who he talks to about these things either 1 discusses their feelings or 2 spins some wild imaginary scenario where everything works out wonderfully because people are like bunnies it sickens me to hear people say they dont believe in borders a nation is its borders these people dont believe in america
who wears short shorts
do yall also think we should deport people fleeing gang violence
if they build the wall all those families getting torn apart can stay together on that side
it just got 10 feet taller
i got a crowder change my mind ad before this video i was so confused
oh man im so excited to watch this
good god what is notgayjared wearing
that was the funniest open ever
build the wall and trebuchets to launch people over it
i hate the public the public is stupid  jack donaghy 30 rock
no more illegals
do u support the wallor is this part of the show 
loan sharking thats the worst im not mad at illegals for coming i get it its nice here im mad at my gov for allowing it and thus creating a black market and crime like loan sharking
1000th like
i am not a trump supporter but i do support anti illegal immigration work just like under obama idk much about this child seperation thing i am against the building of the wall however because i have seen the border and it is already strongly secured a lot of undocumented immigrants arrive legally on visas but they just stay after they are expired i think the wall would not be too effective and just a wasted taxation on the american walleti hope that makes sense steven also sorry you got asshats yelling driveby insults at you as always thank you for content
deport illegals and low iqs please
the left is so superior to us that they wont even come up and talk to steven face to face almost as if they have no way of defending their arguments
the second individual is totally on drugs
build the wall with your ass thats not an argument and its just a weird thing to say
lmao
maybe im confuseddont worry darling you wont be the last
seth rogan stole my joke
poor children being separated from their parentsbuild the wall twice as tall
i got a there are only two genders ad on this video i love it holy fuck dude
that lady is either confused or
sup with zionism
this girl with a 2liter flower vase is either mentally challenged or has an iq of under 80
yeah buddy but the problem is a lot of them dont fucking pay taxes
they cant have a discussion so they shout obscenities like the psuedo intellectual sheep that they are
being in the new england area id travel the entire distance to the southern border just to place a single brick on that glorious wall if i could we need it
that second speaker was on blow believe me
i agree that illegal immigrants are a huge problem but building a wall will cost too much money and it wont do much to stop considering that it cant stop planes  i dont think that we should build it because it would only add to our dept and it wont fix much
the second guy is a fucking idiot lol
this should be easy to do steven what ever it would cost to build that wall which due to geographical reasons would be literally impossible it would be by far cheaper easier and more efficient to do it with a strict border policy what ever that may be what ever it would cost to build that wall it would be 10x more efficient and cheaper to go with a strong border patrol and policy i mean boots on the ground planes drones a serious presence
maybe the people wouldnt talk to you because you werent wearing pants or they just knew they didnt have a real argument
whos sailing the drugs
donald trump is my daddy he wont claim me please change his mind
the lady who leaned into the microphone to whisper priceless seemed like a genuinely good person though
if i had the chance to talk to you for ten minutes about this topic i would be able to change your mind i love the show and i hope you keep doing them

man says his family has lived in new mexico since the 1550s
maybe im confused lmao sweet lady
notifications working fine
they will find some way to get in either wayhow many scrubby mexicans own helicopters
mexico should take their children and put them in foster care  they are not the americans responsibility  mexico allow foreigners in their country  therefore they are responsible for them not the usa  i am so sick how mexico takes advantage of the usa  the criminal parents are responsible and should get their children and go home  it cost us 35000 a year per child  from mexico  some of the american children live in poverty of less than 24000  send them back  stop the excuses and showing the crying children  get them out of our country
go back to campus areas there arent enough crowds in public
asians arent real  change my mind comment edition
going to any country is not a right its a privilege
build the wall baby  trump 2020
ive never seen someone with a common weed most people kill in a jar this woman is backwards in more ways than just her immigration policy
im usually with you crowder but cmon people will find a way to get over under or through the wall mexico wont pay for the cost itll be on american taxes what most people already hate republicans want the wall built but wont pay or fund it they want taxes to cover the wall but not taxes that are on them or their businesses there should be another thought process and initiative to help the immigration issue im hispanic and i couldnt care less that trump is the president im worried about the citizens here and our own well being before any ignorant people come here talking yes i am a legal us citizen we should focus on using tax dollars to better the education system better health care for citizens and amongst other things just my thoughts
build a wall america is just setting itself up for chaos
omfg this is gonna be good 
i dont like taxes and do you want to tax murderers
build the wall maga
steven crowder smashed nicole arbour change my mind
just got here lets see how fun this is going to be
the wall just got 12ft higher
that dummy thinks  border patrol will stop americans she is stupid or illegal or both americans have a pretty easy going passport actually lol we come we go nobody gives a shit lol
crowder will you please warn your austinite friends when youre in town i want your autograph 
13 fucking minutes you cunt
oh boy this should be good
no no no no no  first interviewee
jarreds fanny pack was dope
build a box and lock me and not gay jared in it please
here we go boys
from what i can pick up the first lady commonly visits her family in mexico but then sneaks back across the border without going through customs and thats why she doesnt want the wall
if your against building a wall your just stupid
totally not related but people keep asking me what nugget porn is can someone please tell me
a wall is not immoral building a wall is not about closing off the usa to immigration its about controlling who comes in a wall is efficient at stoping illegal immigrants comparing it to the berlin wall is immoral since it takes away from the immense suffering the people of the ussr endured and all plans i have seen for the border wall do not include a minefield
im a conservative but i think the wall is a pretty bad idea its look cool i guess im against it mainly because i dont think it would work the geography of the border is not just a flat desert
is she high because any who is for illegal immigration has a problem an also do you think its fair for immigrants who took the time to put in the work to become us citizens allowing illegal immigration to me is just a big slap in the face to people who had to do all the paperwork to become citizens
cnn is playing on your emotions they are in the usa illegally they should not be here
as a mexican i approve
get yousef back on
this happened under obama too but you wont see that on cnn only attacks against our president these liberals are mad but i will vote republicans in november also for trump in 2020 im working now and i have a good job our economy is booming trump is hitting hard on china based on their unfairness because china doesnt compete fairly illegal immigration must be stopped at all costs
steven should do a change my mind college series
build that wall build that wall
how do i report those people
1692nd vieweredit  buildthewall
how funny the do you support trump just played
illegal immigration is extremely unfair for the people who are going through the proper process why do i have to get to pay thousands as fees fill loads of paper work and wait years basically being put on hold while people are just walking in if the illegals have families the millions who are waiting on the line like me have families too and they dont get to just skip the line because they can
the border should be run on the honor system
if youre against a wall youre against having locks on your doors and having a fence its that fucking simple
i got so excited then i seen that it was only 13 minutes fucking youtube
i wish you did this segment in la this city is a cesspool of illegal aliens taking over and spreading antiamerican propaganda
got an ad
right now the left and democrats are pushing the idea that families are being torn apart by border patrol but what they fail to realize is that the parents attempted to cross the us border knowing damn well that there was a good chance that they would get caught if anything the democrats should be angry that the parents of these families were willing to take their kids to commit a crime that could potentially tear their family apart these people do not have a right to our country
how do i deport uhh i mean report these people
x is not dead change my mind
ahh geez this outta be good
so many people fake hate america wont leave and yet still want to come to a racist sexist country
if you are against the wall tell me a reason why pls i am curious to know how the hell you think its a bad idea
13 minutes wtf crowder
the first lady was really respectful hope the situation gets solved in her neighborhood
