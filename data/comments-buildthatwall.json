God is a just judge, and must punish you for these sins, because he is perfect by his nature. But God loves you, does not want to punish you. This is why God took the form of a man, Jesus Christ, and died as a sacrifice for your sins on a cross. He was punished for your sins, so that you could be made righteous in God's sight. After three days, Jesus rose again, because it is impossible for him to have been held down by death.\n\nThis is great news! Repent, (that is, change your mind,) and believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and be saved from the judgement of God. God will reward you for your faith with eternal life, and forgiveness for your deeds. I sin, and you sin, and we both will continue to sin, but Jesus Christ died for these sins, and God is willing to forgive them. Please, repent, and believe the Gospel.",

But if they are still doing it today and every day for the last twenty years then Yes. Just because they got away with it twenty years ago doe's not mean they win have the right to get away with it everyday. The crime does not end the day they come in, every second after that they are still committing a crime. Being a criminal is a life lifestyle choice, not a race. You can pick your lifestyle you can not pick your race.\"\nThe next line they always come up with is how hard working illegal immigrants are. To which I say \"So what? Some crime is hard work, not all crime is easy. But it's easy than not being a criminal or people would not be criminals. Do you know whats a harder than being a illegal immigrant? Being a legal immigrant. If it was easier there would be no illegal immigrant. Legal immigrants are the number one group where a large percentage hate illegal immigrants, after all, if you had to work hard, how would you like people who got the same reward for no work?.\"\nOf course they never say illegal immigrants it's always some thing like undocumented guest worker, which I find odd. A guest is some one who is invited, and at the end of that invitation leaves. A guess has no right to tell me how to live my life, and can not get me to change it to be like the place they were so much of a hurry to leave, then want me to pay for it.\nBreaking into a country doesn‚Äôt make you any more a member of that country, than breaking into a house makes you a member of the family.",

The white males in congress have now allowed, CNN, MSNBC, and Hollywood, to chip away at the core key issues, that describes what it means to be a true American supporter of patriotism. We need to hold ALL Republicans that have leftist liberal views accountable, and those politicians who  vote and side with stupid dumb democratic agendas, we need to call them OUT, ! expose them for who they truly are, and give them a very hard time, until these trader Republicans change their leftist liberal asinine anti American agendas.",
